No. 14CA0144, People v. Trujillo — Criminal Law — Sentencing
— Probation — Indeterminate Sentence

     A division of the court of appeals considers whether a

Colorado statute authorizes imposition of a sentence to an

indeterminate term of probation and whether the defendant was

entitled to the benefit of amendments to the statute criminalizing

theft. Relying on People v. Jenkins, 2013 COA 76, 305 P.3d 420,

the division concludes that section 18-1.3-202(1), C.R.S. 2017,

provides statutory authority for the imposition of an indeterminate

probation sentence. Following People v. Stellabotte, 2016 COA 106,

___ P.3d ___ (cert. granted Feb. 6, 2017), the majority further

concludes that the defendant is entitled to the benefit of

amendments to the theft statute. The partial dissent concludes
that the amendments to the theft statute do not apply retroactively,

and would therefore affirm the sentence in full.

     Additionally, the division rejects the defendant’s contentions

that reversal is required due to the trial court’s rejection of

defense-tendered jury instructions, wrongfully admitted character

evidence, and prosecutorial misconduct. However, the division

remands for the trial court to make findings of fact concerning the

assessment of the costs of prosecution.

     Accordingly, the division affirms the conviction, affirms the

sentence in part, vacates the sentence in part, and remands the

case with directions.

Cynthia H. Coffman, Attorney General, Joseph G. Michaels, Assistant Attorney
General, Denver, Colorado, for Plaintiff-Appellee

Douglas K. Wilson, Colorado State Public Defender, James S. Hardy, Deputy
State Public Defender, Denver, Colorado, for Defendant-Appellant
¶1    Defendant, Michael Floyd Trujillo, appeals his judgment of

 conviction entered on a jury verdict finding him guilty of one count

 of theft of more than $20,000 and one count of criminal mischief of

 $20,000 or more. He also appeals his sentence. We perceive no

 basis for reversing his convictions, but remand for the trial court to

 make findings of fact regarding the assessment of the costs of

 prosecution and to reclassify his theft conviction as a class 4 felony.

                            I. Background

¶2    In 2007, Trujillo began building a home, doing much of the

 labor himself and initially using his own money to fund the project.

 He later took out a construction loan from the victim, a bank, for

 just under $255,000. After construction was completed on the

 house, Trujillo stopped making his monthly loan payments. The

 bank declined to restructure the loan and initiated foreclosure

 proceedings in September 2010.

¶3    Before the foreclosure sale, Trujillo removed or destroyed

 property in the house, including kitchen cabinets, countertops,

 interior and exterior doors, doorjambs and casings, flooring,

 baseboards, light fixtures, bathroom fixtures, the fireplace,

 handrails, the boiler, the air conditioner, and the garage door.


                                    1
 Because of this damage, the house was appraised at $150,000;

 however, the appraiser estimated that if the house were in good

 repair, it would have been worth $320,000.

¶4    Trujillo was charged with defrauding a secured creditor, theft

 of $20,000 or more, but less than $100,000, and criminal mischief

 of $20,000 or more, but less than $100,000. The jury found him

 not guilty of defrauding a secured creditor and guilty of theft and

 criminal mischief.

¶5    On appeal, Trujillo raises six contentions: (1) the trial court

 erred in rejecting defense-tendered jury instructions; (2) the trial

 court erred in allowing evidence of a prior foreclosure against

 Trujillo; (3) prosecutorial misconduct during direct examination of a

 witness and closing rebuttal argument warrants reversal; (4) the

 trial court imposed an illegal sentence of indeterminate probation;

 (5) the trial court erred in awarding the People costs of prosecution;

 and (6) an amendment to the theft statute applies to his conviction.

 We perceive no basis for reversal with respect to the first four

 contentions, but agree with Trujillo’s final two contentions. We

 therefore affirm the convictions and the sentence in part but vacate

 the sentence in part and remand with directions.


                                    2
                          II. Jury Instructions

¶6    Trujillo asserts that the trial court erred in rejecting various

 jury instructions regarding his theory of the case. We disagree.

                           A. Additional Facts

¶7    Throughout trial, the defense’s theory of the case was that

 Trujillo lacked the requisite intent to commit the charged offenses

 because he believed that the property he removed from the house

 belonged to him. The defense tendered five jury instructions related

 to this theory of the case.

¶8    Trujillo’s tendered jury instructions detailed property law

 concepts. For example, the first tendered instruction stated that

 “the person who has title to real property is still the owner of the

 property even if there is a lien or secured interest on the property.”

 Another tendered instruction defined “title,” “deed of trust,” and

 “holder of a certificate of purchase[].” One instruction described the

 lien theory detailed in section 38-35-117, C.R.S. 2017, and another

 instructed that title to property “does not vest with the purchaser

 until eight days after [a] foreclosure sale.”

¶9    The trial court declined to give these instructions as tendered.

 However, portions of the defense-tendered instructions were


                                     3
  included in a final definitional jury instruction. The final

  instructions defined “deed of trust” and stated that the title to

  property is transferred to the holder of the certificate of purchase

  eight days after a foreclosure sale. Though it rejected other

  portions of the defense-tendered instructions, the trial court

  permitted defense counsel to argue the issues raised in the

  instructions during closing argument.

¶ 10   The defense also tendered an instruction which the trial court

  modified and gave as a theory of the case instruction. That

  instruction stated, “Trujillo contends that the items removed from

  the home . . . were his; purchased by him and installed by him. . . .

  Trujillo conten[d]s that the items that he took and damaged were

  his sole property.”

                         B. Standard of Review

¶ 11   We review jury instructions de novo to determine whether, as

  a whole, they accurately informed the jury of the governing law.

  Riley v. People, 266 P.3d 1089, 1092-93 (Colo. 2011). If the jury

  instructions properly inform the jury of the law, the district court

  has “broad discretion to determine the form and style of jury

  instructions.” Day v. Johnson, 255 P.3d 1064, 1067 (Colo. 2011).


                                     4
  Accordingly, we review a trial court’s decision concerning a

  proposed jury instruction for an abuse of discretion and will not

  disturb the ruling unless it is manifestly arbitrary, unreasonable, or

  unfair. Id.

¶ 12   When a defendant objects to the trial court’s ruling on a jury

  instruction, we review for nonconstitutional harmless error and will

  thus affirm if “there is not a reasonable probability that the error

  contributed to the defendant’s conviction.” People v. Garcia, 28

  P.3d 340, 344 (Colo. 2001) (quoting Salcedo v. People, 999 P.2d

  833, 841 (Colo. 2000)).

                            C. Applicable Law

¶ 13   “[A]n instruction embodying a defendant’s theory of the case

  must be given by the trial court if the record contains any evidence

  to support the theory.” People v. Nunez, 841 P.2d 261, 264 (Colo.

  1992). Moreover, a trial court has “an affirmative obligation” to

  work with counsel to correct a tendered theory of the case

  instruction “or to incorporate the substance of such in an

  instruction drafted by the court.” Id. at 265; see also People v.

  Tippett, 733 P.2d 1183, 1195 (Colo. 1987) (a trial court may refuse

  to give an instruction already embodied in other instructions).


                                     5
¶ 14   In considering whether a jury was adequately informed of a

  defendant’s theory of the case, a reviewing court can take into

  account whether defense counsel’s closing argument “fairly

  represented” the theory to the jury. People v. Dore, 997 P.2d 1214,

  1222 (Colo. App. 1999).

                               D. Analysis

¶ 15   Trujillo contends that the trial court abused its discretion in

  rejecting the tendered instructions. We disagree.

¶ 16   Trujillo asserts that the tendered instructions were essential

  because they communicated his theory of the case. However, the

  trial court instructed the jury on his theory of the case in an

  instruction that clearly stated that he believed the property he took

  from the house was “his sole property.” To the extent that the trial

  court had a duty to work with the defense in crafting a proper

  theory of defense instruction, we conclude that the trial court

  fulfilled that duty here by giving an alternative theory of the case

  instruction that encompassed Trujillo’s tendered instructions. See

  Nunez, 841 P.2d at 265 n.9. Moreover, the trial court specifically

  stated that defense counsel would be allowed to incorporate the




                                     6
  property law concepts into her closing argument, which defense

  counsel did.

¶ 17   Trujillo asserts that the instructions he tendered were

  accurate statements of property law. In contrast, the People argue

  that the instructions misstated the law as it applies in criminal

  prosecutions for theft and criminal mischief. Because we conclude

  that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in drafting a theory

  of defense instruction that encompassed the defense’s tendered

  instructions, we do not address whether the rejected instructions

  were accurate statements of the law.

¶ 18   The jury instructions, as a whole, “fairly and adequately

  cover[ed] the issues presented.” People v. Pahl, 169 P.3d 169, 183

  (Colo. App. 2006). Thus, we conclude that the trial court did not

  abuse its discretion in rejecting in part the defense-tendered jury

  instructions.

                    III. Evidence of Prior Foreclosure

¶ 19   Trujillo next asserts that the trial court erred in allowing the

  People to introduce evidence that another property of his had been

  foreclosed. We disagree.




                                     7
                           A. Additional Facts

¶ 20   Before trial, Trujillo filed a motion to exclude evidence of other

  acts or res gestae evidence. Trujillo’s motion addressed several

  categories of other acts evidence, including evidence related to any

  “financial and/or legal problems” unrelated to the charged offenses.

  During a motions hearing, the People stated that they did not

  intend to introduce any other acts or res gestae evidence. In a

  written ruling, the trial court granted Trujillo’s motion to exclude

  evidence of his unrelated financial and legal problems “unless the

  prosecution fe[lt] that the ‘door ha[d] been opened.’” The trial court

  further ordered that, if the People felt Trujillo introduced evidence of

  his other financial and legal problems, the People could request a

  bench conference during trial.

¶ 21   On the first day of trial, defense counsel stated that she was

  withdrawing her motion to exclude other acts evidence insofar as it

  pertained to evidence of Trujillo’s bankruptcy proceedings. During

  her opening statement, defense counsel then mentioned those

  proceedings.

¶ 22   Later, the People called the bank’s former vice president as an

  expert witness. During direct examination, the prosecutor asked


                                     8
  the witness why the bank had declined to restructure Trujillo’s

  loan. The prosecutor also asked about Trujillo’s demeanor during

  interactions with the bank. Trujillo objected. After a bench

  conference, the trial court allowed the witness to testify on both

  matters.

¶ 23   Specifically, the witness testified that, during a conversation

  about restructuring the loan, Trujillo “seemed like he was very

  upset.” The witness recalled, “He got into [that] he had a piece of

  property that [another bank] had foreclosed on and it sounded like

  they had sold it for what [Trujillo] believed was a lot less, leaving

  him a large deficiency balance.”

¶ 24   During closing argument, the People alluded to the witness’s

  testimony and referred several times to Trujillo’s general animosity

  against banks.

                          B. Standard of Review

¶ 25   We review a trial court’s decision to admit other acts or res

  gestae evidence for an abuse of discretion. People v. Jimenez, 217

  P.3d 841, 846 (Colo. App. 2008). A court abuses its discretion if its

  decision to admit such evidence is manifestly arbitrary,

  unreasonable, or unfair. Id.


                                      9
¶ 26   We review a preserved claim of nonconstitutional error for

  harmless error, reversing only if any error “substantially influenced

  the verdict or affected the fairness of the trial proceedings.” Hagos

  v. People, 2012 CO 63, ¶ 12, 288 P.3d 116, 119 (quoting Tevlin v.

  People, 715 P.2d 338, 342 (Colo. 1986)).

                           C. Applicable Law

¶ 27   Evidence is relevant if it has “any tendency to make the

  existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of

  the action more probable or less probable than it would be without

  the evidence.” CRE 401. Generally speaking, “[t]he Colorado Rules

  of Evidence strongly favor the admission of relevant evidence.”

  People v. Brown, 2014 COA 155M-2, ¶ 22, 360 P.3d 167, 172.

  However, relevant evidence is nevertheless inadmissible when “its

  probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair

  prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.” CRE

  403. Similarly, evidence of “other crimes, wrongs, or acts” is

  inadmissible to prove a person’s character “in order to show that he

  acted in conformity therewith,” though it may be admissible for

  other purposes, including proving intent. CRE 404(b).




                                    10
¶ 28   “Res gestae is a theory of relevance which recognizes that

  certain evidence is relevant because of its unique relationship to the

  charged crime.” People v. Greenlee, 200 P.3d 363, 368 (Colo. 2009).

  However, “there is no need to consider an alternative theory of

  relevance, such as res gestae, where the evidence is admissible

  under general rules of relevancy.” Id.

                               D. Analysis

¶ 29   Trujillo contends that the evidence of the prior foreclosure

  action portrayed him as a “serial defaulter” and was impermissible

  under CRE 404(b) and 403. The People assert that the evidence

  was admissible as “directly relevant” to Trujillo’s intent and motive.

  In the alternative, the People argue that the evidence was res gestae

  evidence. We agree with the People’s first argument that the

  evidence was admissible under CRE 401, and was not barred by

  CRE 403.1



  1 During the bench conference, the trial court allowed the bank’s
  former vice president to testify after conducting an abbreviated CRE
  404(b) analysis that did not specifically address the four-factor test
  set forth in People v. Spoto, 795 P.2d 1314, 1318 (Colo. 1990). The
  trial court did not admit the evidence under the res gestae doctrine.
  However, we can affirm a trial court’s evidentiary ruling on any
  ground supported by the record, “even if that ground was not

                                    11
¶ 30   The evidence of the prior foreclosure was probative of the

  interactions between Trujillo and the bank — it made it more

  probable that Trujillo had the requisite intent to commit theft. It

  was therefore relevant under CRE 401. Further, the risk of unfair

  prejudice did not substantially outweigh the probative value of the

  evidence, especially where the prior foreclosure was referenced only

  in passing and the details of that foreclosure were not revealed.

  Thus, the evidence was not barred by CRE 403.

¶ 31   Because we conclude that the evidence of the prior foreclosure

  was relevant under CRE 401 and admissible under CRE 403, we

  need not address whether the evidence was res gestae evidence or

  “other acts” evidence under CRE 404(b). See Greenlee, 200 P.3d at

  368-69. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in

  allowing the testimony concerning the prior foreclosure action.

                      IV. Prosecutorial Misconduct

¶ 32   Trujillo argues that the prosecutor improperly commented on

  the district attorney’s screening process for bringing charges and




  articulated or considered by the trial court.” People v. Phillips, 2012
  COA 176, ¶ 63, 315 P.3d 136, 153.

                                    12
  Trujillo’s right not to testify, and improperly denigrated defense

  counsel. We perceive no basis for reversal.

                           A. Additional Facts

¶ 33   During redirect examination of one of the People’s expert

  witnesses, an attorney who worked at the bank, the prosecutor

  asked whether the bank played a role in charging Trujillo. The

  prosecutor asked if the witness himself made the decision to file a

  criminal case, to which the witness replied, “No.” The prosecutor

  then asked, “[W]ho is it, according to your understanding, that

  makes those decisions on whether a case gets filed criminally?” The

  witness responded, “A complaint’s made to a police department or

  sheriff’s department and they make that decision in conjunction

  with I believe you.” The prosecutor clarified that “you” meant the

  district attorney’s office. The defense did not object.

¶ 34   During rebuttal closing argument, the prosecutor said,

             Did you hear all that? [Defense counsel]’s
             talking about all of this stuff, about what
             Trujillo’s intent was. And then did you hear
             her towards the end what she did? She says,
             and correct – this part was correct of what she
             said. My job is to prove intent, right. That is
             my burden. And she’s absolutely right. The
             Defendant has every right to remain silent,



                                    13
            and he exercised that right and that is
            something that you cannot use against him.

            But it is completely ridiculous for [defense
            counsel] to get up here and say that [Trujillo]
            didn’t testify to what his intent was and then
            to go on and talk about what his intent
            actually was. We don’t know what his intent
            was because he never testified to that, which
            he has every right to do. But did you hear
            her? She’s up here saying his intent was this.

¶ 35   Trujillo objected on the basis that the prosecutor was

  denigrating defense counsel. The trial court sustained the objection

  as to the prosecutor’s tone, but overruled it as to content. The

  prosecutor then argued, “[I]f you go out and run somebody over and

  – and think that you had the right to do that, is that gonna be a

  legitimate defense by saying, well, I thought I could do that. I didn’t

  – nobody ever told me. Nobody put it in writing. When I bought my

  car, in the instruction manual, nothing said that about that. That’s

  preposterous.” Trujillo did not renew his objection.

                         B. Standard of Review

¶ 36   In reviewing alleged prosecutorial misconduct, an appellate

  court engages in a two-step analysis. First, we determine whether

  the prosecutor’s conduct was improper based on the totality of the

  circumstances. Wend v. People, 235 P.3d 1089, 1096 (Colo. 2010).


                                    14
  Second, we determine whether any misconduct warrants reversal

  under the proper standard of review. Id.

¶ 37   When the alleged misconduct is objected to at trial and is of

  constitutional magnitude, we review for constitutional harmless

  error. Id. When the alleged misconduct is not of a constitutional

  magnitude, and when the defense objected at trial, we subject the

  prosecutorial misconduct to harmless error review. Id. at 1097.

  Such prosecutorial misconduct will be considered harmless

  “whenever there is no reasonable probability that it contributed to

  the defendant’s conviction.” Crider v. People, 186 P.3d 39, 42 (Colo.

  2008). When the defense did not object to the misconduct, we

  review for plain error. Wend, 235 P.3d at 1097-98.

                           C. Applicable Law

¶ 38   A prosecutor cannot comment on a “screening process” for

  charging cases “because it both hints that additional evidence

  supporting guilt exists and reveals the personal opinion of the

  prosecutor.” Domingo-Gomez v. People, 125 P.3d 1043, 1052 (Colo.

  2005). It is also improper for a prosecutor to make remarks “for the

  obvious purpose of denigrating defense counsel.” People v. Jones,

  832 P.2d 1036, 1038 (Colo. App. 1991). It is similarly improper for


                                   15
  a prosecutor to comment on a defendant’s decision not to testify.

  Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 614 (1965); see also People v.

  Martinez, 652 P.2d 174, 177 (Colo. App. 1981) (noting that a

  prosecutor’s comment on a defendant’s silence constitutes

  reversible error when “the prosecution argued that such silence

  constituted an implied admission of guilt”).

¶ 39   Nevertheless, “[a] prosecutor is allowed considerable latitude

  in responding to the argument made by opposing counsel.” People

  v. Ramirez, 997 P.2d 1200, 1211 (Colo. App. 1999), aff’d, 43 P.3d

  611 (Colo. 2001). Further, “[a]lthough it is improper for a

  prosecutor to assert that opposing counsel knows that the

  accused’s case is not meritorious,” the prosecutor may permissibly

  argue “that the evidence in support of defendant’s innocence lacked

  substance.” Id. at 1211; see also People v. Samson, 2012 COA 167,

  ¶ 31, 302 P.3d 311, 317 (stating that a prosecutor may permissibly

  “comment on the absence of evidence to support a defendant’s

  contentions”).

¶ 40   Appellate courts consider several factors in determining

  whether prosecutorial misconduct was prejudicial, including the

  nature of the error, the pervasiveness of the misconduct, the


                                    16
  context, and the overall strength of the evidence supporting the

  conviction. People v. McBride, 228 P.3d 216, 225 (Colo. App. 2009);

  see also Crider, 186 P.3d at 43. For example, a reviewing court may

  consider whether proper jury instructions mitigated the prejudicial

  effect of prosecutorial misconduct. See People v. Castillo, 2014 COA

  140M, ¶ 78, ___ P.3d ___, ___ (concluding prosecutor’s

  misstatements were harmless in light of instructions from the trial

  court and the defense’s closing argument) (cert. granted in part Nov.

  23, 2015).

                               D. Analysis

¶ 41   Trujillo contends that three instances of prosecutorial

  misconduct require reversal. We disagree.

¶ 42   Trujillo first contends that the prosecutor improperly referred

  to a screening process while examining the expert witness. We

  perceive no prosecutorial misconduct. The prosecutor here did not

  imply that he had engaged in a screening process to “weed out the

  weaker cases and, implicitly, that the State d[id] not consider this a

  weak case.” Domingo-Gomez, 125 P.3d at 1052 (concluding the

  prosecutor’s comment that “it takes a lot more than somebody

  saying that person did it” to bring charges was improper). Rather,


                                    17
  the prosecutor clarified that the bank did not bring criminal

  charges and that the witness himself did not stand to gain as a

  result of Trujillo’s conviction. The People assert, and we agree, that

  the prosecutor’s question merely elicited testimony to establish that

  the district attorney’s office was responsible for pursuing the

  criminal charges against Trujillo.

¶ 43   Second, Trujillo asserts that the prosecutor impermissibly

  commented on his decision not to testify. We disagree. Even if we

  assume the comment on Trujillo’s decision not to testify was

  improper, not every comment on a defendant’s choice not to testify

  requires reversal. See Martinez, 652 P.2d at 177. “The determining

  factor is whether the defendant’s silence was used by the

  prosecution as a means of creating an inference of guilt,” id., and

  we conclude that the prosecutor’s comments here did not raise

  such an inference.

¶ 44   Finally, Trujillo contends that the prosecutor impermissibly

  denigrated defense counsel and the defense’s theory of the case

  during rebuttal closing argument. We agree that the prosecutor

  improperly denigrated defense counsel and the defense’s theory of




                                       18
  the case when he characterized her arguments as “completely

  ridiculous” and “preposterous.”

¶ 45   However, we perceive no basis for reversal as a result of these

  improper remarks. The comments were limited to the People’s

  rebuttal closing argument. Moreover, significant evidence

  corroborated the jury’s finding of guilt — specifically, the

  undisputed evidence that Trujillo had removed an extensive amount

  of property from the house. Viewing the record as a whole, we

  cannot say that there was a “reasonable probability” that the

  prosecutor’s remarks denigrating defense counsel contributed to

  Trujillo’s convictions. See Crider, 186 P.3d at 42. Thus, we

  determine the error was harmless.

¶ 46   In sum, though we agree that the prosecutor improperly

  denigrated defense counsel, we perceive no basis for reversal.

                       V. Indeterminate Probation

¶ 47   Trujillo contends that the trial court did not have the statutory

  authority to sentence him to indeterminate probation. We disagree.

                           A. Additional Facts

¶ 48   During the sentencing hearing, the People requested that

  Trujillo be placed on a “long period of probation . . . somewhere in


                                    19
  the neighborhood of eight to ten years” because they anticipated

  that Trujillo would be ordered to pay substantial restitution.2

  Trujillo requested unsupervised probation with a collections

  investigator monitoring his restitution payments.

¶ 49   The trial court imposed an “indefinite probation sentence”

  because of the substantial restitution that Trujillo was expected to

  owe. In imposing an indeterminate probation sentence, the trial

  court stated, “There is case law that talks about whether

  [indeterminate probation] is something that can or should be

  imposed and it’s certainly something that is allowed regardless of

  the type of conviction that has been entered.”

¶ 50   The mittimus states that the sentence imposed was a term of

  probation for seven years to life.

                          B. Standard of Review

¶ 51   The People contend that we should not consider this claim

  because a sentence to probation is not ordinarily subject to



  2 The trial court ultimately ordered Trujillo to pay $171,421.97 in
  restitution. Trujillo separately appealed that order, and a division
  of this court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for
  reconsideration. People v. Trujillo, (Colo. App. No. 14CA2486, Oct.
  5, 2017) (not published pursuant to C.A.R. 35(e)).

                                       20
  appellate review. However, “where, as here, a defendant contends

  that ‘a court has exceeded its statutory authority’ in imposing a

  probationary sentence, appellate review is warranted.” People v.

  Jenkins, 2013 COA 76, ¶ 10, 305 P.3d 420, 423 (quoting People v.

  Rossman, 140 P.3d 172, 174 (Colo. App. 2006)).

¶ 52   “We review sentencing decisions that are within the statutory

  range for an abuse of discretion.” People v. Torrez, 2013 COA 37,

  ¶ 71, 316 P.3d 25, 37. However, where the defendant contends that

  a court exceeded its statutory sentencing authority, our inquiry

  involves statutory interpretation. Jenkins, ¶ 12, 305 P.3d at 423.

  We review such issues of statutory interpretation de novo. Id.

                           C. Applicable Law

¶ 53   Under section 18-1.3-202(1)(a), C.R.S. 2017, a trial court “may

  grant the defendant probation for such period and upon such terms

  and conditions as it deems best.” Further, “[t]he length of probation

  shall be subject to the discretion of the court and may exceed the

  maximum period of incarceration authorized for the classification of

  the offense of which the defendant is convicted.” Id.

¶ 54   In Jenkins, a division of this court concluded that section 18-

  1.3-202(1) “authorizes a trial court to impose an indeterminate term


                                   21
  of probation.” Jenkins, ¶ 38, 305 P.3d at 426. The Jenkins division

  bolstered its conclusion by looking to the plain language of the

  statute — which the division noted “contemplate[s] both

  determinate and indeterminate terms of probation” — and to the

  provision’s legislative history. Id. at ¶¶ 40, 42, 46, 305 P.3d at 426-

  28. Finally, the division noted that section 18-1.3-202(1) “generally

  pertains to a broad class of cases, and it simply allows a trial court

  to elect an indeterminate term if it sentences an offender who has

  been convicted of a felony to probation.” Id. at ¶ 50, 305 P.3d at

  428 (upholding probationary sentence of ten years to life); see also

  People v. Martinez, 844 P.2d 1203, 1206 (Colo. App. 1992)

  (concluding that a trial court has authority to impose a term of

  probation that exceeds the sentence to imprisonment in the

  statutory aggravated range for an offense).

                               D. Analysis

¶ 55   Trujillo asserts that the trial court exceeded its statutory

  authority in imposing an indeterminate probationary sentence. We

  disagree.

¶ 56   Like the Jenkins division, we conclude that section 18-1.3-

  202(1) gives a trial court the authority to sentence a defendant


                                    22
  convicted of a felony to an indefinite probationary period. Trujillo

  urges that the statute limits a trial court’s authority to impose an

  indeterminate probation sentence. Under Trujillo’s logic, a sentence

  to probation for 100 years is permissible, but an indeterminate

  probation sentence is outside the trial court’s statutory authority.

  The statute offers no basis for reaching this conclusion.

¶ 57   Trujillo asserts that Jenkins is distinguishable because that

  case concerned whether a defendant convicted of a sex offense not

  falling under the supervision scheme of the Colorado Sex Offender

  Lifetime Supervision Act of 1998 (SOLSA), see §§ 18-1.3-1001

  to -1012, C.R.S. 2017, could nevertheless be sentenced to

  indeterminate probation. Jenkins, ¶ 1, 305 P.3d at 422. Trujillo

  contends that Jenkins was limited to the particular circumstances

  of that case, and does not widely apply to all offenses and

  defendants. However, the Jenkins division made clear that section

  18-1.3-202(1) “establishes a general rule as far as the possibility of

  an indeterminate probationary term for felonies” and “authorizes a

  trial court to impose an indeterminate term of probation.” Id. at

  ¶¶ 38, 50, 305 P.3d at 426, 428. In fact, Jenkins explicitly rejected

  the argument that a sentence of indeterminate probation could be


                                    23
  imposed only in sex offense cases subject to SOLSA. Id. at ¶¶ 49-

  50, 305 P.3d at 428. Thus, Trujillo’s argument that Jenkins is

  limited to sex offenses is unavailing.

¶ 58   In sum, we conclude that the trial court did not exceed its

  statutory authority in imposing the probation sentence here.

                         VI. Costs of Prosecution

¶ 59   Trujillo next asserts that the trial court erred in awarding the

  full costs of prosecution requested by the People without making a

  finding on whether any portion of the costs was attributable to the

  charge on which he was acquitted. We agree.

                           A. Additional Facts

¶ 60   Before sentencing, the People moved for reimbursement of the

  costs of prosecution pursuant to section 18-1.3-701, C.R.S. 2017.

  The People requested $768.70. Trujillo opposed the motion on the

  basis that the People bore responsibility for the costs incurred to

  prove the defrauding a secured creditor charge, of which Trujillo

  was acquitted.

¶ 61   During the sentencing hearing, the trial court awarded the

  requested costs of prosecution, ordering Trujillo to pay $768.70.




                                    24
                          B. Standard of Review

¶ 62   The trial court, in its discretion, may assess reasonable and

  necessary costs of prosecution against a convicted defendant. See

  § 18-1.3-701(2)(j.5). Thus, we review an assessment of costs of

  prosecution for an abuse of discretion, reversing if the trial court’s

  determination is manifestly arbitrary, unreasonable, or unfair,

  People v. Palomo, 272 P.3d 1106, 1110 (Colo. App. 2011), or if the

  trial court misapplied the law, People v. Jefferson, 2017 CO 35,

  ¶ 25, 393 P.3d 493, 499.

                             C. Applicable Law

¶ 63   Under section 16-18-101(1), C.R.S. 2017, the state bears the

  costs of prosecution when a defendant is acquitted. Such costs

  may include witness fees, mileage, lodging expenses, transportation

  costs, and other reasonable and necessary costs that directly result

  from prosecuting the defendant. § 18-1.3-701(2); see also People v.

  Sinovcic, 2013 COA 38, ¶¶ 15-16, 304 P.3d 1176, 1179. If a

  defendant is convicted of fewer than all of the charged counts, the

  court may assess only those costs attributable to the counts for

  which the defendant was convicted, if an allocation is practicable.

  Palomo, 272 P.3d at 1112.


                                    25
                               D. Analysis

¶ 64   Trujillo asserts that the trial court erred in not making a

  finding as to whether some portion of the requested costs of

  prosecution were allocable to the acquitted charge. We agree.

¶ 65   As Trujillo concedes, it is possible that the costs cannot be

  allocated between the charge on which he was acquitted and the

  two charges on which he was convicted. However, the trial court

  did not find that such an allocation was impracticable. Because the

  trial court was required to consider whether some portion of the

  requested costs was practicably attributable to the acquitted

  charge, the trial court abused its discretion. See DeBella v. People,

  233 P.3d 664, 667 (Colo. 2010) (failure to exercise discretion

  constitutes an abuse of the court’s discretion).

¶ 66   Accordingly, we vacate the order awarding the People costs of

  prosecution and remand for the trial court to make appropriate

  findings of fact and “assess only those costs that are related to the

  prosecution of the . . . counts of which [Trujillo] was convicted, to

  the extent an allocation is practicable.” Palomo, 272 P.3d at 1113.

                    VII. Amendment to Theft Statute

¶ 67   Trujillo contends that he should have benefited from an

  amendment to the theft statute reclassifying theft between $20,000

  and $100,000 as a class 4 felony. We agree.

                            A. Additional Facts

¶ 68   The General Assembly amended the theft statute on June 5,

  2013. See Ch. 373, sec. 1, § 18-4-401, 2013 Colo. Sess. Laws

  2196. Under the amended statute, theft between $20,000 and

  $100,000 constitutes a class 4 felony. See § 18-4-401(2)(h), C.R.S.

  2017. Prior to the amendment, theft over $20,000 constituted a

  class 3 felony. § 18-4-401(2)(d), C.R.S. 2011.

¶ 69   Trujillo was charged with theft of $20,000 or more in April

  2011. He was convicted in October 2013 and sentenced in

  December 2013. His theft conviction was recorded on the mittimus

  as a class 3 felony.

                         B. Standard of Review

¶ 70   The People assert that, because Trujillo did not make this

  argument before the trial court, we should review only for plain

  error. However, the division in People v. Stellabotte rejected this

  argument. 2016 COA 106, ¶ 42, ___ P.3d ___, ___ (noting that plain


                                    27
  error review was inappropriate because “a defendant may raise a

  claim at any time that his or her sentence was not authorized by

  law”) (cert. granted Feb. 6, 2017). Following Stellabotte, we review

  the legality of the sentence de novo. Id. at ¶ 4, ___ P.3d at ___.

                             C. Applicable Law

¶ 71   In determining whether to apply amendments to legislation,

  we first look to the plain language of the statute. People v.

  Summers, 208 P.3d 251, 253-54 (Colo. 2009). If a statute explicitly

  states that it applies only to offenses committed after the effective

  date, it must be applied accordingly. See People v. McCoy, 764 P.2d

  1171, 1174 (Colo. 1988).

¶ 72   As a general rule, “[a] statute is presumed to be prospective in

  its operation.” § 2-4-202, C.R.S. 2017. However, if a statute is

  silent as to whether it applies only prospectively, a defendant may

  seek retroactive application if he or she benefits from a significant

  change in the law. § 18-1-410(1)(f)(I), C.R.S. 2017; see also People

  v. Thornton, 187 Colo. 202, 203, 529 P.2d 628, 628 (1974) (allowing

  defendant to seek relief on direct appeal under statute).

¶ 73   In Stellabotte, a division of this court concluded that the

  amendatory theft legislation “applies retroactively to cases pending


                                    28
  in the trial court when the amendment was enacted.” Stellabotte,

  ¶ 45, ___ P.3d at ___; People v. Patton, 2016 COA 187, ¶ 32, ___ P.3d

  ___, ___; see also People v. Patton, (Colo. App. No. 14CA2359, Aug.

  11, 2016) (not published pursuant to C.A.R. 35(e)) (cert. granted

  Feb. 6, 2017).

                                D. Analysis

¶ 74   Trujillo contends that the amendment to the theft statute

  requires that we vacate his sentence and remand for the trial court

  to enter his theft conviction as a class 4 felony. We agree.

¶ 75   As the division noted in Stellabotte, the theft amendment does

  not explicitly state that it is either retroactive or prospective.

  Stellabotte, ¶ 45, ___ P.3d at ___. In the face of this legislative

  silence, the division held that a defendant who committed theft

  prior to the statutory amendment but was not convicted until after

  its passage was entitled to the benefit retroactively. See id. at

  ¶¶ 39, 45, ___ P.3d at ___. The same is true here.

¶ 76   Trujillo was charged with theft before the statute was

  amended, but was not convicted or sentenced until after the

  General Assembly lowered the classification for theft between




                                      29
  $20,000 and $100,000.3 Thus, like the defendant in Stellabotte,

  Trujillo is entitled to the benefit of the amendment. As a result, we

  vacate the sentence for the theft conviction and remand for the

  conviction to be entered as a class 4 felony.

¶ 77   The partial dissent looks to several statutory provisions in

  support of its conclusion that Trujillo is not entitled to the benefit of

  the amendatory legislation. First, the partial dissent cites section

  2-4-202, which states the general presumption that statutes apply

  prospectively. However, as the division noted in Stellabotte, section

  18-1-410 is a specific exception to the general rule expressed in

  section 2-4-202. Stellabotte, ¶ 47 n.4, ___ P.3d at ___ n.4. We

  agree with that analysis. Thus, the general presumption that

  statutes apply prospectively does not apply here where Trujillo

  seeks the benefit of a “significant change in the law, . . . allowing in




  3 Trujillo asserts that the theft was between $20,000 and $100,000
  based on testimony from trial. The People do not contest the value
  of the stolen property in this case. We therefore assume that
  Trujillo’s offense properly fell within the value range set forth in
  section 18-4-401(2)(h), C.R.S. 2017.

                                     30
  the interests of justice retroactive application of the changed legal

  standard.”4 § 18-1-410(1)(f)(I).

¶ 78   The partial dissent also invokes section 2-4-303, C.R.S. 2017,

  in support of its conclusion. Section 2-4-303 states:

             The repeal, revision, amendment, or
             consolidation of any statute or part of a statute
             or section or part of a section of any statute
             shall not have the effect to release, extinguish,
             alter, modify, or change in whole or in part any
             penalty, forfeiture, or liability, either civil or
             criminal, which shall have been incurred
             under such statute, unless the repealing,
             revising, amending, or consolidating act so
             expressly provides.

¶ 79   However, the supreme court has noted that the “general

  saving” provision codified in this statute is not applicable to

  criminal cases; instead, the court noted in dictum that it “has


  4 The partial dissent also asserts that section 18-1-410(1)(f)(I),
  C.R.S. 2017, does not provide any relief to Trujillo because that
  provision requires that “there has been significant change in the
  law, applied to the [defendant’s] conviction or sentence.” The
  partial dissent asserts that the phrase “applied to” requires that the
  legislation expressly state that it applies retroactively. We disagree
  with that interpretation, and believe that our view finds authority in
  supreme court case law. See People v. Thomas, 185 Colo. 395, 397,
  525 P.2d 1136, 1137 (1974) (noting that “[t]he legislature intended
  the changed legal standards to apply wherever constitutionally
  permissible” but making no mention of whether the amendatory
  legislation reclassifying attempted second degree burglary explicitly
  stated that it applied retroactively).

                                     31
  consistently adhered to the principle . . . that a defendant is entitled

  to the benefits of amendatory legislation when relief is sought before

  finality has attached to the judgment of conviction.” Noe v. Dolan,

  197 Colo. 32, 36 n.3, 589 P.2d 483, 486 n.3 (1979).

¶ 80   In People v. Boyd, a division of the court of appeals concluded

  that section 2-4-303 did not prevent the retroactive effect of an

  amendatory constitutional provision. 2015 COA 109, ¶ 27, 395

  P.3d 1128, 1134, aff’d, 2017 CO 2, 387 P.3d 755.5 The division

  noted the supreme court’s language in Noe. Id. at ¶ 28, 395 P.3d at

  1134. To the extent that other supreme court cases included

  contrary statements, the Boyd division concluded that such

  statements were dicta and that the supreme court had not

  overruled or disapproved of either Noe or People v. Thomas, 185

  Colo. 395, 398, 525 P.2d 1136, 1138 (1974) (holding that

  “amendatory legislation mitigating the penalties for crimes should

  be applied to any case which has not received final judgment”).



  5 The supreme court in Boyd affirmed the Court of Appeals decision
  on different grounds, concluding that the marijuana criminal
  offense statute had been rendered inoperative by Amendment 64.
  Neither the majority nor the dissent in Boyd cited section 2-4-303,
  C.R.S. 2017.

                                    32
  Boyd, ¶¶ 29-30, 395 P.3d at 1134-35. Finally, the Boyd division

  concluded that section 18-1-410(1)(f)(I) controls over section 2-4-

  303 because the former sets forth a specific exception to the latter,

  which codifies a “general rule[] of construction regarding

  prospective effect for amendatory legislation.” Id. at ¶¶ 31-32, 395

  P.3d at 1135. We agree with the Boyd division’s analysis and

  therefore do not perceive section 2-4-303 as a bar to the relief

  Trujillo seeks.

¶ 81   In making its statutory arguments, the partial dissent relies

  on the plain meaning of both section 2-4-303 and section 18-1-

  410(1)(f)(I). However, as discussed, the supreme court has not

  given either provision its plain meaning. Despite express reference

  in section 2-4-303 to civil and criminal penalties, the supreme court

  has indicated that the provision does not apply to criminal cases.

  Noe, 197 Colo. at 36 n.3, 589 P.2d at 486 n.3. Similarly, while

  section 18-1-410(1)(f)(I) by its express terms applies to defendants

  seeking postconviction relief, the supreme court has held that the

  statute also extends to defendants seeking relief on direct appeal.

  Thornton, 187 Colo. at 203, 529 P.2d at 628. In light of the




                                    33
  supreme court’s interpretation of these statutes, we cannot give

  them the meanings that the partial dissent ascribes to them.

¶ 82   Finally, the partial dissent also relies on Riley v. People, in

  which the supreme court noted that it has “emphasized that a

  defendant is not entitled to the ameliorative effects of amendatory

  legislation if the General Assembly has not clearly indicated its

  intent to require such retroactive application.” 828 P.2d 254, 258

  (Colo. 1992). However, we do not consider this statement to have

  the controlling effect the partial dissent gives it. In Riley, the

  defendant committed a crime in April 1988 and sought relief under

  two sentencing provisions that expressly stated they applied to acts

  “committed on or after” July 1, 1988. Id. at 255-56. The Riley

  court held the defendant there was not entitled to relief because

  applying the statutes retroactively would require the court to ignore

  the “clear legislative determination” that the amended sentencing

  provisions would apply only to acts after that date. Id. at 257.

¶ 83   Thus, Riley is readily distinguishable from the present case,

  where the amendments to the theft statute do not expressly provide

  an effective date, and the language relied on by the partial dissent is

  dicta. Accord McCoy, 764 P.2d at 1174 (noting that, where


                                     34
  legislation expressly stated it applied to acts committed on or after

  its effective date, a “defendant does not receive any ameliorative

  benefit” because “retroactive application of the amendatory

  legislation is clearly not intended by its own terms”); People v.

  Macias, 631 P.2d 584, 587 (Colo. 1981) (same).

¶ 84   Thus, we conclude, in accordance with Stellabotte, that Trujillo

  should receive the benefit of the amendment to the theft statute

  reclassifying theft between $20,000 and $100,000 as a class 4

  felony. See Stellabotte, ¶ 40, ___ P.3d at ___.

                               VIII. Conclusion

¶ 85   Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is affirmed. The

  sentence is affirmed in part and vacated in part, and the case is

  remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views

  expressed in this opinion.

          JUDGE FURMAN, concurring in part and dissenting in part.

¶ 86      I respectfully dissent from the majority’s opinion only as to the

  effect of the 2013 amendments to the theft statute. I conclude that

  the 2013 amendments to the theft statute do not apply retroactively

  to Trujillo’s case. I reach this conclusion for several reasons.

¶ 87      First, the General Assembly has made it clear that a “statute is

  presumed to be prospective in its operation.” § 2-4-202, C.R.S.

  2017. The 2013 amendments to the theft statute are silent as to

  whether they apply prospectively or retroactively. Therefore, I

  presume that the 2013 amendments are prospective in operation

  and do not apply to Trujillo’s offense, which occurred before 2013.

  See id.

¶ 88      Second, an amendment to a criminal statute does not change

  the penalty for crimes already committed under the statute unless

  the amendatory legislation expressly provides for such a change.

  See § 2-4-303, C.R.S. 2017. Section 2-4-303 provides, in relevant

  part:

               The . . . amendment . . . of any statute or part
               of a statute . . . shall not have the effect to
               release, extinguish, alter, modify, or change in
               whole or in part any penalty, forfeiture, or
               liability, either civil or criminal, which shall


                                      36
             have been incurred under such statute, unless
             the . . . amending . . . act so expressly
             provides, and such statute or part of a statute
             . . . so . . . amended . . . shall be treated and
             held as still remaining in force for the purpose
             of sustaining any and all proper actions, suits,
             proceedings, and prosecutions, criminal as
             well as civil, for the enforcement of such
             penalty, forfeiture, or liability, as well as for
             the purpose of sustaining any judgment,
             decree, or order which can or may be rendered,
             entered, or made in such actions, suits,
             proceedings, or prosecutions imposing,
             inflicting, or declaring such penalty, forfeiture,
             or liability.

  Because the 2013 amendments to the theft statute do not expressly

  provide that they apply retroactively, and Trujillo committed his

  crime before 2013, he is liable for theft as it was defined when he

  committed the offense. See id.

¶ 89   Third, in Riley v. People, 828 P.2d 254, 258 (Colo. 1992), our

  supreme court “emphasized that a defendant is not entitled to the

  ameliorative effects of amendatory legislation if the General

  Assembly has not clearly indicated its intent to require such

  retroactive application.” Id. I consider this statement by the

  supreme court about its own jurisprudence on this issue to be

  controlling.




                                    37
¶ 90   Fourth, section 18-1-410(1)(f)(I), C.R.S. 2017, does not allow

  Trujillo, on direct appeal, to seek retroactive application of the 2013

  amendments to his case. Section 18-1-410(1)(f)(I) allows a

  defendant to seek retroactive application of a “significant change in

  the law, applied to” a defendant’s “conviction or sentence.” I believe

  that the phrase “applied to” reflects the General Assembly’s intent

  that, for amendatory legislation to apply retroactively to a

  defendant’s conviction or sentence, the legislation must state that it

  applies retroactively. Thus, because, as noted, the 2013

  amendments do not state that they apply retroactively to Trujillo’s

  conviction and sentence, he may not seek retroactive application

  under section 18-1-410(1)(f)(I).

¶ 91   Finally, and with all due respect, I decline to follow People v.

  Stellabotte, 2016 COA 106 (cert. granted Feb. 6, 2017). Indeed, I

  agree with Judge Dailey’s dissent in Stellabotte. See id. at ¶¶ 62-70

  (Dailey, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).

OPINlON BY ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE D’ALESSANDRIS ON
APPELLANT’S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERAT]ON

Appellant _ (-) has timely filed a motion
for reconsideration of our 21 November 2016 decision granting the govemment’s
motion for summary judgment and denying this appeal.

-, ASBCA No. 60315, 1(»1 BCA 11 36,569. Familiariiy with our decision is
presumed

In deciding a motion for reconsideration, we examine whether the motion is
based upon newly discovered evidence, mistakes in our findings of fact, or errors of
law. Zulco International, lnc., ASBCA No. 55441, 08-1 BCA 1| 33,799 at 167,319. A
motion for reconsideration does not provide the moving party the opportunity to
reargue its position or to advance arguments that properly should have been presented
in an earlier proceeding See Dixon v. Shz`nseki, 741 F.3d 1367, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2014).
We do not grant motions for reconsideration absent a compelling reason. J.F. Taylor,
Inc., ASBCA Nos. 56105, 56322, 12-2 BCA 11 35,125 at 172,453.

- argues in its motion for reconsideration that the government breached the
contract by violating PAR 52.233-3, PROTEST AFTER AWARD (AUG 1996) for failing to
cancel the stop-work order or terminating the contract for convenience after the
post-award protest period (app. mot. at l, 8). In our decision, we addressed this same
argument and stated that “the suspension of work and termination for convenience
clauses provide no relief when no work was ordered under an [indefinite-delivery,
indefinite-quantity] contract and the contractor has been paid the minimum contract
value.” _, 16-1 BCA 11 36,569 ar 178,109.

-, in its reply, acknowledges that part of our decision cited above, but
argues that the government should still pay costs which it incurred after the suspension
of work was allegedly lifted (app. reply br. at 7). However, all of the costs incurred
were considered in our decision and found to be generated by tasks which was
already expected to do under the terms of the contract.
16-1 BCA il 36,569 at 178,110-11.

We conclude - has not shown any compelling reason to modify our original
decision, as - merely reargues its original position relying on the same facts.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, -’s motion for reconsideration is denied.

Before LOKEN, COLLOTON, and BENTON, Circuit Judges.
                          ____________

BENTON, Circuit Judge.

        Barbara Hager was fired from the Arkansas Department of Health by her
supervisor, Dr. Namvar Zohoori. Hager sued Dr. Zohoori and the Department for
statutory and constitutional violations. The district court granted, in part, their
motion to dismiss. They appeal. Having jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 over
Dr. Zohoori’s appeal, this court reverses and remands.
                                          I.

       Hager claims that in May 2011, her branch chief and supervisor, Dr. Zohoori,
instructed her to cancel a doctor’s appointment (necessary, she says, to prevent
cataracts) in order to discuss a report. When she refused, she alleges Dr. Zohoori
became irritated and falsely claimed she was insubordinate and disrespectful. Four
days later, he terminated her without explanation.


      Hager sued Dr. Zohoori, in his individual and official capacities, and the
Department alleging violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Equal
Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Constitution (§ 1983 claim), the Age
Discrimination and Employment Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Family and
Medical Leave Act (FMLA).


      Dr. Zohoori and the Department moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim
and sovereign immunity. The district court denied their motion in part, allowing three
claims against Dr. Zohoori in his individual capacity (§ 1983 gender discrimination,
FMLA “interference,” and FMLA “retaliation”) and two claims against the
Department (Title VII and Rehabilitation Act). They appeal.


                                         II.

       Hager objects to this court’s jurisdiction over Dr. Zohoori’s appeal, arguing it
turns on issues of factual sufficiency. A denial of qualified immunity is an appealable
“final decision” only “to the extent it turns on an issue of law.” Mitchell v. Forsyth,
472 U.S. 511, 530 (1985). Hager relies on cases reviewing a denial of summary
judgment based on qualified immunity. See Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 313-14
(1995) (holding that where a district court’s summary judgment order on qualified
immunity turns on the issue of evidence sufficiency—“which facts a party may, or

                                         -2-
may not, be able to prove at trial”—the order is not appealable); Powell v. Johnson,
405 F.3d 652, 654-55 (8th Cir. 2005). In Ashcroft v. Iqbal, the Supreme Court
determined the jurisdiction of a court of appeals in a case like Hager’s—denial of a
motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity:


      As a general matter, the collateral-order doctrine may have expanded
      beyond the limits dictated by its internal logic and the strict application
      of the criteria set out in Cohen. But the applicability of the doctrine in
      the context of qualified-immunity claims is well established; and this
      Court has been careful to say that a district court’s order rejecting
      qualified immunity at the motion-to-dismiss stage of a proceeding is a
      “final decision” within the meaning of § 1291. Behrens, 516 U.S., at
      307, 116 S. Ct. 834.


      Applying these principles, we conclude that the Court of Appeals had
      jurisdiction to hear petitioners’ appeal. The District Court’s order
      denying petitioners’ motion to dismiss turned on an issue of law and
      rejected the defense of qualified immunity. It was therefore a final
      decision “subject to immediate appeal.” Ibid. Respondent says that “a
      qualified immunity appeal based solely on the complaint’s failure to
      state a claim, and not on the ultimate issues relevant to the qualified
      immunity defense itself, is not a proper subject of interlocutory
      jurisdiction.” Brief for Respondent Iqbal 15 (hereinafter Iqbal Brief).
      In other words, respondent contends the Court of Appeals had
      jurisdiction to determine whether his complaint avers a clearly
      established constitutional violation but that it lacked jurisdiction to pass
      on the sufficiency of his pleadings. Our opinions, however, make clear
      that appellate jurisdiction is not so strictly confined.


Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 672-73 (2009).




                                          -3-
      Here, Dr. Zohoori challenges the sufficiency of Hager’s pleadings to state §
1983, FMLA “interference,” and FMLA “retaliation” claims. This is an issue of law
over which this court has jurisdiction. See id. at 672-74; Bradford v. Huckabee, 394
F.3d 1012, 1015 (8th Cir. 2005). See also Rondigo, L.L.C. v. Township of
Richmond, 641 F.3d 673, 679 (6th Cir. 2011).

                                           III.

        This court reviews de novo the denial of a motion to dismiss on the basis of
qualified immunity. Bradford, 394 F.3d at 1015. A complaint must “state a claim
to relief that is plausible on its face.” Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544,
570 (2007). Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the factual allegations
in the complaint are accepted as true and viewed most favorably to the plaintiff.
Gross v. Weber, 186 F.3d 1089, 1090 (8th Cir. 1999). Courts must not presume the
truth of legal conclusions couched as factual allegations. Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S.
265, 286 (1986). Courts should dismiss complaints based on “labels and conclusions,
and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.” Twombly, 550 U.S.
at 555.

       Under the doctrine of qualified immunity, a court must dismiss a complaint
against a government official in his individual capacity that fails to state a claim for
violation of “clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a
reasonable person would have known.” Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818
(1982). See also Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 685; Mitchell, 472 U.S. at 526 (“Unless the
plaintiff’s allegations state a claim of violation of clearly established law, a defendant
pleading qualified immunity is entitled to dismissal before the commencement of
discovery.”). A court considers whether the plaintiff has stated a plausible claim for
violation of a constitutional or statutory right and whether the right was clearly
established at the time of the alleged infraction. Powell, 405 F.3d at 654-55. See
Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236 (2009) (“[D]istrict courts and the courts of

                                           -4-
appeals should be permitted to exercise their sound discretion in deciding which of
the two prongs of the qualified immunity analysis should be addressed first in light
of the circumstances in the particular case at hand.”).

                                         A.

       The § 1983 claim against Dr. Zohoori individually (Count I) alleges that Hager
was “a victim of gender discrimination . . . and has been denied her right of equal
protection of the law and due process of the law.” Specifically, she contends she
“was discharged under circumstances summarily [sic] situated nondisabled males .
. . were not.”

       “[T]he Equal Protection Clause requires that the government treat such
similarly situated persons alike.” Keevan v. Smith, 100 F.3d 644, 648 (8th Cir.
1996), citing City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 439
(1985); Klinger v. Department of Corrs., 31 F.3d 727, 731 (8th Cir. 1994). Absent
evidence of direct discrimination, courts apply the McDonnell Douglas burden-
shifting analysis to claims of employment discrimination under the Equal Protection
Clause. Lockridge v. Board of Trs. of Univ. of Arkansas, 315 F.3d 1005, 1010 (8th
Cir. 2003) (en banc). Under McDonnell Douglas, a prima facie case of discrimination
requires that a plaintiff prove: “(1) membership in a protected group; (2)
qualification for the job in question; (3) an adverse employment action; and (4)
circumstances that support an inference of discrimination.” Swierkiewicz v. Sorema
N. A., 534 U.S. 506, 510 (2002), citing McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S.
792, 801 (1973).

      Dr. Zohoori argues that Hager does not state a § 1983 claim for gender
discrimination because her allegation—that she “was discharged under circumstances
summarily [sic] situated nondisabled males, younger people, or those that did not
require leave or accommodation were not”—is a legal conclusion. Hager contends

                                         -5-
her “similarly situated” allegation is sufficient because McDonnell Douglas is “an
evidentiary standard, not a pleading requirement.” Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at 510;
Ring v. First Interstate Mortg., 984 F.2d 924, 926 (8th Cir. 1993).

       Under Swierkiewicz, a plaintiff need not plead facts establishing a prima facie
case of discrimination under McDonnell Douglas in order to defeat a motion to
dismiss. Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at 510-11. The complaint “must contain only ‘a
short and plain statement of the claim showing the pleader is entitled to relief.’” Id.
at 508. “Such a statement must simply ‘give the defendant fair notice of what the
plaintiff’s claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.’” Id. at 512, citing Conley
v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47 (1957).

       In Twombly, the Supreme Court stated that Swierkiewicz did not change the law
of pleading. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 569. Rather, courts need “not require heightened
fact pleading of specifics, but only enough facts to state a claim to relief that is
plausible on its face.” Id. at 570. “[L]egal conclusions can provide the framework
of a complaint” but “must be supported by factual allegations,” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at
679, that “raise a right to relief above the speculative level.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at
555. Thus, this court applies “the ordinary rules for assessing the sufficiency of a
complaint,” Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at 511, to consider whether Hager states a § 1983
claim for gender discrimination. See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570.

      Hager relies primarily on Swierkiewicz. However, her complaint has far fewer
factual allegations than the complaint there. In Swierkiewicz, the complaint for age
and nationality discrimination alleged: the plaintiff was demoted and replaced by a
younger employee of the employer’s nationality; the replacement was inexperienced;
in promoting the younger, inexperienced employee, the employer wanted to
“energize” the department; the employer excluded and isolated plaintiff from business
decisions and meetings; plaintiff sent a memo outlining his grievances and tried to


                                         -6-
meet with the employer to discuss his discontent; and plaintiff was fired.
Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at 508-09.

       Hager makes only two conclusory allegations of gender discrimination: (1) she
“is a victim of gender discrimination;” and (2) she “was discharged under
circumstances summarily [sic] situated nondisabled males . . . were not.” She does
not allege any gender-related comments or conduct before her termination. See
Rondigo, 641 F.3d at 682 (granting qualified immunity in part because the complaint
contained no allegations of gender-based discriminatory actions). She also does not
allege facts showing that similarly situated employees were treated differently. See
Coleman v. Maryland Court of Appeals, 626 F.3d 187, 190-91 (4th Cir. 2010)
(plaintiff’s conclusory allegation that he “was treated differently as a result of his race
than whites”—even where plaintiff identified an alleged comparator—was
insufficient to sustain a Title VII claim because no factual allegations plausibly
suggested the comparator was similarly situated). See also Keevan, 100 F.3d at 648
(“To establish a gender-based claim under the Equal Protection Clause, the appellants
must, as a threshold matter, demonstrate that they have been treated differently by a
state actor than others who are similarly situated simply because appellants belong
to a particular protected class.”).

       In sum, Hager does not state a § 1983 claim for gender discrimination. Hager’s
allegation that she is the victim of gender discrimination fails to give Dr. Zohoori fair
notice of the claim and the grounds upon which it rests. See Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S.
at 512. Hager’s conclusory assertion that she was discharged under circumstances
similarly situated men were not imports legal language couched as a factual allegation
and fails to raise a right to relief above the speculative level. See Twombly, 550 U.S.
at 555. The district court erred in denying Dr. Zohoori’s motion to dismiss the § 1983
claim.




                                           -7-
                                         B.

      Hager alleges a claim for “interfering with exercise of Plaintiff’s rights under
the FMLA.” Under the categorization in Pulczinski v. Trinity Structural Towers, Inc.,
691 F.3d 996 (8th Cir. 2012), Hager’s “interference” claim is an entitlement claim.
Pulczinski, 691 F.3d at 1005-06. “The FMLA entitles an employee to twelve
workweeks of leave during any twelve-month period if he or she has a ‘serious health
condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of
such employee.’” Sisk v. Picture People, Inc., 669 F.3d 896, 899 (8th Cir. 2012),
quoting Wierman v. Casey’s Gen. Stores, 638 F.3d 984, 999 (8th Cir. 2011), quoting
29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(D). An FMLA entitlement claim arises when an employer
denies or interferes with an employee’s substantive FMLA rights. Scobey v. Nucor
Steel-Arkansas, 580 F.3d 781, 785 (8th Cir. 2009).

       An employee seeking FMLA leave must give the employer notice of the need
for leave and indicate when she anticipates returning to work. Id. at 785-86. See also
Rynders v. Williams, 650 F.3d 1188, 1196-97 (8th Cir. 2011) (plaintiff must prove
she gave timely notice to defendant himself). Although the notice need not
specifically invoke the FMLA, an employee “must provide information to suggest
that [her] health condition could be serious.” Scobey, 580 F.3d at 786. When the
leave is foreseeable, the employee must give at least thirty days notice. 29 C.F.R. §
825.302. When the leave is not foreseeable, “an employee must provide notice to the
employer as soon as practicable under the facts and circumstances of the particular
case.” 29 C.F.R. § 825.303.

      Hager alleges that she “saw a physician regularly for her cataracts,” but “[o]n
May 13, 2011, [Dr. Zohoori] instructed her to cancel the doctor’s appointment so she
and he could discuss a report.” She also avers that she explained “the reason she
needed to go to the doctor,” that “she could not cancel the appointment,” and why she
could not cancel. These allegations do not state an FMLA entitlement claim. While

                                         -8-
Hager alleges that she provided information suggesting a serious health condition, she
does not allege that she provided timely notice. Hager’s pleadings at best suggest Dr.
Zohoori was aware of her leave request immediately prior to the appointment. They
do not assert that she provided notice within thirty days or “as soon as practicable
under the circumstances.” Nor do they assert that she indicated when she would
return. See generally Bosley v. Cargill Meat Solutions Corp., 705 F.3d 777, 780 (8th
Cir. 2013) (there is a “rigorous notice standard for employees seeking to use FMLA
leave for absences”).

       The district court erred in denying Dr. Zohoori’s motion to dismiss the FMLA
entitlement claim.

                                         C.

       Hager also alleges a claim for “retaliating against her.” Under the
categorization in Pulczinski, Hager’s “retaliation” claim is a discrimination claim.
Pulczinski, 691 F.3d at 1006. In a discrimination claim, “the employee alleges that
the employer discriminated against her for exercising her FMLA rights.” Sisk, 669
F.3d at 899, quoting Wierman, 638 F.3d at 999. Absent direct evidence, an FMLA
discrimination claim is analyzed under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting
framework. Sisk, 669 F.3d at 899. The plaintiff must “show that she exercised rights
afforded by the Act, that she suffered an adverse employment action, and that there
was a causal connection between her exercise of rights and the adverse employment
action.” Phillips v. Mathews, 547 F.3d 905, 912 (8th Cir. 2008), quoting Smith v.
Allen Health Sys., Inc., 302 F.3d 827, 832 (8th Cir. 2002). This is an evidentiary,
not a pleading, standard. Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at 510.

      Hager alleges that Dr. Zohoori discriminated against her—firing her—because
she exercised her FMLA rights—tried to take leave for a doctor’s appointment, which
was “necessary to insure that [her] condition did not develop into a serious health

                                         -9-
condition, cataracts.” If Hager had properly alleged notice, these allegations would
be sufficient. See Wehrley v. American Family Mut. Ins. Co., 513 Fed. Appx. 733,
742 (10th Cir. 2013) (“Three other circuits have concluded that notifying an employer
of the intent to take FMLA leave is protected activity. . . . We are persuaded to follow
these circuits.”), citing Pereda v. Brookdale Senior Living Communities, Inc., 666
F.3d 1269, 1276 (11th Cir. 2012); Erdman v. Nationwide Ins. Co., 582 F.3d 500, 509
(3d Cir. 2009); Skrjanc v. Great Lakes Power Serv. Co., 272 F.3d 309, 314 (6th Cir.
2001). However, because Hager failed to plead notice of intent to take FMLA leave,
and that she was qualified for that leave, she has not sufficiently alleged that she
exercised FMLA rights. See Nicholson v. Pulte Homes Corp., 690 F.3d 819, 828
(7th Cir. 2012) (“The district court held that because Nicholson did not provide
sufficient notice of the need for FMLA-qualifying leave, she never engaged in any
activity protected by the FMLA. For the reasons we have explained, we agree.”).

      The district court erred in denying Dr. Zohoori’s motion to dismiss the FMLA
discrimination claim.

       Although Hager did not move to amend the complaint in the district
court—where the relevant pleadings were found sufficient—she requests remand to
allow an amended complaint for any claims insufficiently pled. Hager should be no
worse off, and no better off, than she would have been if the district court had granted
the motion to dismiss. See Horras v. American Capital Strategies, Ltd., 729 F.3d
798, 804-05 (8th Cir. 2013) (evaluating standards applicable to post-judgment
motions). This court remands for the district court to consider whether to allow
Hager to amend her pleadings. See Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc.,
401 U.S. 321, 330 (1971) (granting leave to amend is within the discretion of the
district court).

       The Arkansas Department of Health requests that this court exercise its pendent
appellate jurisdiction to review the district court’s partial denial of its motion to
dismiss. See Langford v. Norris, 614 F.3d 445, 457 (8th Cir. 2010) (“[W]hen an
interlocutory appeal is before us . . . as to the defense of qualified immunity, we have
jurisdiction also to decide closely related issues of law, i.e., pendent appellate
claims.”) (internal quotation marks omitted), quoting Kincade v. City of Blue
Springs, Mo., 64 F.3d 389, 394 (8th Cir. 1995). The Department maintains that
Hager’s claims against it are inextricably intertwined with her claims against Dr.
Zohoori. The Department reasons that if Hager’s “similarly situated” allegation does
not sustain her § 1983 and FMLA discrimination claims against Dr. Zohoori, it
cannot sustain her Title VII and Rehabilitation Act claims against the Department.

      “[A] pendent appellate claim can be regarded as inextricably intertwined with
a properly reviewable claim on collateral appeal only if the pendent claim is
coterminous with, or subsumed in, the claim before the court on interlocutory
appeal—that is, when the appellate resolution of the collateral appeal necessarily
resolves the pendent claim as well.” Kincade, 64 F.3d at 394, quoting Moore v. City
of Wynnewood, 57 F.3d 924, 930 (10th Cir. 1995). See also Lockridge, 315 F.3d at
1012. Here, resolution of the “similarly situated” issue may illuminate the
Department’s argument that Hager failed to state a claim against it. However, the
Department’s claims are not coterminous with or subsumed in Dr. Zohoori’s claims.
Hager sues under different statutes, and the Department cannot invoke qualified
immunity. This court does not have jurisdiction to hear the Department’s appeal.

L. GENE ALLARD, Plaintiff, Cross-defendant and Respondent,
v.
CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY OF CALIFORNIA, Defendant, Cross-complainant and Appellant.
Docket No. 45562.
Court of Appeals of California, Second District, Division Two.
May 18, 1976.

OPINION
BEACH, J.
L. Gene Allard sued the Church of Scientology for malicious prosecution. Defendant cross-complained for conversion. A jury verdict and judgment were entered for Allard on the complaint for $50,000 in compensatory damages and $250,000 in punitive damages. Judgment was entered for Allard and against the Church of Scientology on the cross-complaint. Defendant-cross complainant appeals from the judgment.

FACTS:
The evidence in the instant case is very conflicting. We relate those facts supporting the successful party and disregard the contrary showing. (Nestle v. City of Santa Monica, 6 Cal.3d 920, 925-926 [101 Cal. Rptr. 568, 496 P.2d 480].)
In March 1969, L. Gene Allard became involved with the Church of Scientology in Texas. He joined Sea Org in Los Angeles and was sent to San Diego for training. While there, he signed a billion-year contract agreeing to do anything to help Scientology and to help clear the planet of the "reactive people." During this period he learned about written policy directives that were the "policy" of the church, emanating from L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of the Church of Scientology.[1] After training on the ship, respondent was assigned to the Advanced Organization in Los Angeles, where he became the director of disbursements. He later became the Flag Banking Officer.
*444 Alan Boughton, Flag Banking Officer International, was respondent's superior. Only respondent and Boughton knew the combination to the safe kept in respondent's office. Respondent handled foreign currency, American cash, and various travelers' checks as part of his job.
In May or June 1969, respondent told Boughton that he wanted to leave the church. Boughton asked him to reconsider. Respondent wrote a memo and later a note; he spoke to the various executive officers. They told him that the only way he could get out of Sea Org was to go through "auditing" and to get direct permission from L. Ron Hubbard. Respondent wrote to Hubbard. A chaplain of the church came to see him. Lawrence Krieger, the highest ranking justice official of the church in California, told respondent that if he left without permission, he would be fair game and "You know we'll come and find you and we'll bring you back, and we'll deal with you in whatever way is necessary."
On the night of June 7 or early morning of June 8, 1969, respondent went to his office at the Church of Scientology and took several documents from the safe. These documents were taken by him to the Internal Revenue Service in Kansas City; he used them to allege improper changes in the records of the church. He denies that any Swiss francs were in the safe that night or that he took such Swiss francs. Furthermore, respondent denies the allegation that he stole various travelers' checks from the safe. He admitted that some travelers' checks had his signature as an endorsement, but maintains that he deposited those checks into an open account of the Church of Scientology. There is independent evidence that tends to corroborate that statement. Respondent, having borrowed his roommate's car, drove to the airport and flew to Kansas City, where he turned over the documents to the Internal Revenue Service.
Respondent was arrested in Florida upon a charge of grand theft. Boughton had called the Los Angeles Police Department to report that $23,000 in Swiss francs was missing. Respondent was arrested in Florida; he waived extradition and was in jail for 21 days. Eventually, the charge was dismissed. The deputy district attorney in Los Angeles recommended a dismissal in the interests of justice.[2]


*445 CONTENTIONS ON APPEAL:
1. Respondent's trial counsel engaged in flagrant misconduct throughout the proceedings below and thereby deprived appellant of a fair trial.
2. The verdict below was reached as a result of (a) counsel's ascription to appellant of a religious belief and practices it did not have and (b) the distortion and disparagement of its religious character, and was not based upon the merits of this case. To allow a judgment thereby achieved to stand would constitute a violation of appellant's free exercise of religion.
3. Respondent failed to prove that appellant maliciously prosecuted him and therefore the judgment notwithstanding the verdict should have been granted.
4. The refusal of the trial court to ask or permit voir dire questions of prospective jurors pertaining to their religious prejudices or attitudes deprived appellant of a fair trial.
5. It was prejudicial error to direct the jury, in its assessment of the malicious prosecution claim, to disregard evidence that respondent stole appellant's Australian and American Express travelers' checks.
6. The order of the trial court in denying to appellant discovery of the factual basis for the obtaining of a dismissal by the district attorney of the criminal case People v. Allard was an abuse of discretion and a new trial should be granted and proper discovery permitted.
7. Respondent presented insufficient evidence to support the award of $50,000 in compensatory damages which must have been awarded because of prejudice against appellant.
8. Respondent failed to establish corporate direction or ratification and also failed to establish knowing falsity and is therefore not entitled to any punitive damages.
9. Even if the award of punitive damages was proper in this case, the size of the instant reward, which would deprive appellant church of more *446 than 40 percent of its net worth, is grossly excessive on the facts of this case.
10. There was lack of proper instruction regarding probable cause.[3]

DISCUSSION:

1. There was no prejudicial misconduct by respondent's trial counsel, and appellant was not deprived of a fair trial.

Appellant claims that it was denied a fair trial through the statements, questioning, and introduction of certain evidence by respondent's trial counsel. Love v. Wolf, 226 Cal. App.2d 378 [38 Cal. Rptr. 183], is cited as authority.
We have reviewed the entire record and find appellant's contentions to be without merit. Several of counsel's individual statements and questions were inappropriate. However, there often were no objections by counsel for appellant where an objection and subsequent admonition would have cured any defect; or there was an objection, and the trial court judiciously admonished the jury to disregard the comment. Except for these minor and infrequent aberrations, the record reveals an exceptionally well-conducted and dispassionate trial based on the evidence presented.
As in Stevens v. Parke, Davis & Co., 9 Cal.3d 51, 72 [107 Cal. Rptr. 45, 507 P.2d 653], a motion for a new trial was made, based in part upon the alleged misconduct of opposing counsel at trial. (1) What was said in Stevens applies to the instant case. "`A trial judge is in a better position than an appellate court to determine whether a verdict resulted wholly, or in part, from the asserted misconduct of counsel and his conclusion in the matter will not be disturbed unless, under all the circumstances, it is plainly wrong.' [Citation.] From our review of the instant record, we agree with the trial judge's assessment of the conduct of plaintiff's counsel and for the reasons stated above, we are of the opinion that defendant has failed to demonstrate prejudicial misconduct on the part of such counsel." (Stevens v. Parke, Davis & Co., supra, 9 Cal.3d at p. 72.)

2. The procedure and verdict below does not constitute a violation of appellant's First Amendment free exercise of religion.

*447 (2) Appellant contends that various references to practices of the Church of Scientology were not supported by the evidence, were not legally relevant, and were unduly prejudicial. The claim is made that the trial became one of determining the validity of a religion rather than the commission of a tort.
The references to which appellant now objects were to such practices as "E-meters," tin cans used as E-meters, the creation of religious doctrine purportedly to "get" dissidents, and insinuations that the Church of Scientology was a great money making business rather than a religion.
The principal issue in this trial was one of credibility. If one believed defendant's witnesses, then there was indeed conversion by respondent. However, the opposite result, that reached by the jury, would naturally follow if one believed the evidence introduced by respondent. Appellant repeatedly argues that the introduction of the policy statements of the church was prejudicial error. However, those policy statements went directly to the issue of credibility. Scientologists were allowed to trick, sue, lie to, or destroy "enemies." (Exhibit 1.) If, as he claims, respondent was considered to be an enemy, that policy was indeed relevant to the issues of this case. That evidence well supports the jury's implied conclusion that respondent had not taken the property of the church, that he had merely attempted to leave the church with the documents for the Internal Revenue Service, and that those witnesses who were Scientologists or had been Scientologists were following the policy of the church and lying to, suing and attempting to destroy respondent. Evidence of such policy statements were damaging to appellant, but they were entirely relevant. They were not prejudicial. A party whose reprehensible acts are the cause of harm to another and the reason for the lawsuit by the other cannot be heard to complain that its conduct is so bad that it should not be disclosed. The relevance of appellant's conduct far outweighs any claimed prejudice.[4]
We find the introduction of evidence of the policy statements and other peripheral mention of practices of the Church of Scientology not to be error. In the few instances where mention of religious practices may have been slightly less germane than the policy statements regarding fair game, they were nonetheless relevant and there was no prejudice to appellant by the introduction of such evidence.


*448 3. The trial court properly denied the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.

(3) Appellant claimed that it had probable cause to file suit against respondent. The claim is made that even if Alan Boughton did take the checks from the safe, knowledge of that act should not be imputed to appellant church.
Based on the policy statements of appellant that were introduced in evidence, a jury could infer that Boughton was within the scope of his employment when he stole the francs from the safe or lied about respondent's alleged theft. Inferences can be drawn that the church, through its agents, was carrying out its own policy of fair game in its actions against respondent. Given that view of the evidence, which as a reviewing court we must accept, there is substantial evidence proving that appellant maliciously prosecuted respondent. Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying the motion for the judgment notwithstanding the verdict.

4. The trial court performed proper voir dire of prospective jurors.

(4) Appellant claims that the trial court refused to ask or permit voir dire questions of prospective jurors pertaining to their religious prejudices or attitudes. The record does not so indicate. Each juror was asked if he or she had any belief or feeling toward any of the parties that might be regarded as a bias or prejudice for or against any of them. Each juror was also asked if he or she had ever heard of the Church of Scientology. If the juror answered affirmatively, he or she was further questioned as to the extent of knowledge regarding Scientology and whether such knowledge would hinder the rendering of an impartial decision. One juror was excused when she explained that her husband is a clergyman and that she knows a couple that was split over the Church of Scientology.
(5) The trial court's thorough questioning served the purpose of voir dire, which is to select a fair and impartial jury, not to educate the jurors or to determine the exercise of peremptory challenges. (Rousseau v. West Coast House Movers, 256 Cal. App.2d 878, 882 [64 Cal. Rptr. 655].)

5. It was not prejudicial error to direct the jury, in its assessment of the malicious prosecution claim, to disregard evidence that respondent stole appellant's Australian and American Express travelers' checks.

*449 (6) Appellant submits that evidence of respondent's purported theft of the Australian and American Express travelers' checks should have been admitted as to the issue of malicious prosecution as well as the cross-complaint as to conversion. If there were any error in this regard, it could not possibly be prejudicial since the jury found for respondent on the cross-complaint. It is evident that the jury did not believe that respondent stole the travelers' checks; therefore, there could be no prejudice to appellant by the court's ruling.

6. Appellant suffered no prejudice by the trial court's denial of discovery of the factual basis for obtaining of the dismissal by the district attorney.

(7) Prior to trial, appellant apparently sought to discover the reasons underlying the dismissal of the criminal charges against respondent. This was relevant to the instant case since one of the elements of a cause of action for malicious prosecution is that the criminal prosecution against the plaintiff shall have been favorably terminated. (Jaffe v. Stone, 18 Cal.2d 146 [114 P.2d 335, 135 A.L.R. 775].)
Whether or not the lower court was justified in making such an order, the denial of discovery along these lines could not be prejudicial. During the trial, counsel for all parties stipulated that the criminal proceedings against Allard were terminated in his favor by a dismissal by a judge of that court upon the recommendation of the district attorney.
In addition, there was a hearing outside the presence of the jury in which the trial court inquired of the deputy district attorney as to the reasons for the dismissal. It was apparent at that time that the prospective witnesses for the Church of Scientology were considered to be evasive. There was no prejudice to appellant since the deputy district attorney was available at trial. Earlier knowledge of the information produced would not have helped defendant. We find no prejudicial error in the denial of this discovery motion.

7. The award of $50,000 compensatory damages was proper.

Appellant contends that based upon the evidence presented at trial, the compensatory damage award is excessive. In addition, appellant contends that the trial court erred in not allowing appellant to introduce evidence of respondent's prior bad reputation.
*450 (8a) There was some discussion at trial as to whether respondent was going to claim damaged reputation as part of general damages. The trial court's initial reaction was to allow evidence only of distress or emotional disturbance; in return for no evidence of damaged reputation, appellant would not be able to introduce evidence of prior bad reputation. The court, however, relying on the case of Clay v. Lagiss, 143 Cal. App.2d 441 [299 P.2d 1025], held that lack of damage to reputation is not admissible. Therefore, respondent was allowed to claim damage to reputation without allowing appellant to introduce evidence of his prior bad reputation.
In matters of slander that are libelous per se, for example the charging of a crime, general damages have been presumed as a matter of law. (Douglas v. Janis, 43 Cal. App.3d 931, 940 [4] [118 Cal. Rptr. 280], citing Clay v. Lagiss, supra, 143 Cal. App.2d at p. 448. Compare Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323 [41 L.Ed.2d 789, 94 S.Ct. 2997].)[5] (9) Damages in malicious prosecution actions are similar to those in defamation. Therefore, damage to one's reputation can be presumed from a charge, such as that in the instant case that a person committed the crime of theft. (8b) In any event, as the trial court in the instant case noted, there was no offer of proof regarding respondent's prior bad reputation; any refusal to allow possible evidence on that subject has not been shown to be error, much less prejudicial error.
(10) Appellant further contends that the amount of compensatory damages awarded was excessive and that the jury was improperly instructed regarding compensatory damages. The following modified version of BAJI Nos. 14.00 and 14.13 was given:
"If, under the court's instructions, you find that plaintiff is entitled to a verdict against defendant, you must then award plaintiff damages in an amount that will reasonably compensate him for each of the following elements of loss or harm, which in this case are presumed to flow from *451 the defendant's conduct without any proof of such harm or loss: damage to reputation, humiliation and emotional distress.
"No definite standard or method of calculation is prescribed by law to fix reasonable compensation for these presumed elements of damage. Nor is the opinion of any witness required as to the amount of such reasonable compensation. Furthermore, the argument of counsel as to the amount of damages is not evidence of reasonable compensation. In making an award for damage to reputation, humiliation and emotional distress, you shall exercise your authority with calm and reasonable judgment, and the damages you find shall be just and reasonable."
The following instruction was requested by defendant and was rejected by the trial court: "The amount of compensatory damages should compensate plaintiff for actual injury suffered. The law will not put the plaintiff in a better position than he would be in had the wrong not been done." Accompanying the request for that motion is a citation to Staub v. Muller, 7 Cal.2d 221 [60 P.2d 283], and Basin Oil Co. v. Baash-Ross Tool Co., 125 Cal. App.2d 578 [271 P.2d 122].
The Supreme Court has recognized that "Damages potentially recoverable in a malicious prosecution action are substantial. They include out-of-pocket expenditures, such as attorney's and other legal fees ...; business losses ...; general harm to reputation, social standing and credit ...; mental and bodily harm ...; and exemplary damages where malice is shown...." (Babb v. Superior Court, 3 Cal.3d 841, 848, fn. 4 [92 Cal. Rptr. 179, 479 P.2d 379].) While these damages are compensable, it is the determination of the damages by the jury with which we are concerned. Appellant seems to contend that the jury must have actual evidence of the damages suffered and the monetary amount thereof.
"`The determination of the jury on the issue of damages is conclusive on appeal unless the amount thereof is so grossly excessive that it can be reasonably imputed solely to passion or prejudice in the jury. [Citations.]'" (Douglas v. Janis, supra, 43 Cal. App.3d at p. 940.) The presumed damage to respondent's reputation from an unfounded charge of theft, along with imprisonment for 21 days, and the mental and emotional anguish that must have followed are such that we cannot say that the jury's finding of $50,000 in compensatory damages is unjustified. *452 That amount does not alone demonstrate that it was the result of passion and prejudice.

8. Respondent is entitled to punitive damages.

(11) Appellant cites the general rule that although an employer may be held liable for an employee's tort under the doctrine of respondeat superior, ordinarily he cannot be made to pay punitive damages where he neither authorized nor ratified the act. (4 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law. (8th ed.) § 855, p. 3147.)[6] Appellant claims that the Church of Scientology, which is the corporate defendant herein, never either authorized or ratified the malicious prosecution.
The finding of authorization may be based on many grounds in the instant case. For example, the fair game policy itself was initiated by L. Ron Hubbard, the founder and chief official in the church. (Exhibit 1.) It was an official authorization to treat "enemies" in the manner in which respondent herein was treated by the Church of Scientology.
Furthermore, all the officials of the church to whom respondent relayed his desire to leave were important managerial employees of the corporation. (See 4 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed.) supra, § 857, p. 3148.)
The trier of fact certainly could have found authorization by the corporation of the act involved herein.

9. The award of punitive damages.

(12) Any party whose tenets include lying and cheating in order to attack its "enemies" deserves the results of the risk which such conduct entails. On the other hand, this conduct may have so enraged the jury that the award of punitive damages may have been more the result of *453 feelings of animosity, rather than a dispassionate determination of an amount necessary to assess defendant in order to deter it from similar conduct in the future. In our view the disparity between the compensatory damages ($50,000) and the punitive damages ($250,000) suggests that animosity was the deciding factor. Our reading of the decisional authority compels us to conclude that we should reduce the punitive damages. We find $50,000 to be a reasonable amount to which the punitive damages should be reduced. We perceive this duty, and have so modified the punitive damages award not with any belief that a reviewing court more ably may perform it.[7] (13) Simply stated the decisional authority seems to indicate that the reviewing court should examine punitive damages and where necessary modify the amount in order to do justice. (Cunningham v. Simpson, 1 Cal.3d 301 [81 Cal. Rptr. 855, 461 P.2d 39]; Forte v. Nolfi, 25 Cal. App.3d 656 [102 Cal. Rptr. 455]; Shroeder v. Auto Driveaway Company, 11 Cal.3d 908 [114 Cal. Rptr. 622, 523 P.2d 662]; Livesey v. Stock, 208 Cal. 315, 322 [281 P. 70].)

10. Instruction on probable cause.

Appellant requested an instruction stating: "Where it is proven that a judge has had a preliminary hearing and determined that the facts and evidence show probable cause to believe the plaintiff guilty of the offense charged therefore, ordering the plaintiff to answer a criminal complaint, this is prima facie evidence of the existence of probable cause." The trial court gave the following instruction: "The fact that plaintiff was held to answer the charge of grand theft after a preliminary hearing is evidence tending to show that the initiator of the charge had probable cause. This fact is to be considered by you along with all the other evidence tending to show probable cause or the lack thereof."[8]
Appellant claimed for the first time in its reply brief that the trial court's lack of proper instruction regarding probable cause was prejudicial error. Since this issue was raised for the first time in appellant's reply brief, we decline to review the issue.[9]
*454 The judgment is modified by reducing the award of punitive damages only, from $250,000 to the sum of $50,000. As modified the judgment is in all other respects affirmed.
Costs on appeal are awarded to respondent Allard.
Roth, P.J., and Fleming, J., concurred.
A petition for a rehearing was denied June 17, 1976, and the petitions of both parties for a hearing by the Supreme Court were denied July 15, 1976.
NOTES
[1]  One such policy, to be enforced against "enemies" or "suppressive persons" was that formerly titled "fair game." That person "[m]ay be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist. May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed." (Exhibit 1.)
[2]  Leonard J. Shaffer, the deputy district attorney, testified outside the presence of the jury that members of the church were evasive in answering his questions. He testified that the reasons for the dismissal were set forth in his recommendation; the dismissal was not part of a plea bargain or procedural or jurisdictional issue.
[3]  This issue is raised for the first time in appellant's reply brief.
[4]  The trial court gave appellant almost the entire trial within which to produce evidence that the fair game policy had been repealed. Appellant failed to do so, and the trial court thereafter permitted the admission of Exhibit 1 into evidence.
[5]  The Supreme Court held in Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., supra, 418 U.S. 323, 349 [41 L.Ed.2d 789, 810], an action for defamation, that "the States may not permit recovery of presumed or punitive damages, at least when liability is not based on a showing of knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth." (Italics added.) The instant case is distinguishable from Gertz. Initially, the interests protected by a suit for malicious prosecution include misuse of the judicial system itself; a party should not be able to claim First Amendment protection maliciously to prosecute another person. Secondly, the jury in the instant case must have found "knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth" in order to award punitive damages herein. Therefore, even under Gertz, a finding of presumed damages is not unconstitutional.
[6]  We again note that Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., supra, precludes the award of punitive damages in defamation actions "at least when liability is not based on a showing of knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth." The facts of the instant case fall within that categorization, so a finding of punitive damages was proper. Moreover, as we noted above, an egregious case of malicious prosecution subjects the judicial system itself to abuse, thereby interfering with the constitutional rights of all litigants. Punitive damages may therefore be more easily justified in cases of malicious prosecution than in cases of defamation. The societal interests competing with First Amendment considerations are more compelling in the former case.

[8]  This instruction was given on the court's own motion.
[9]  We note that given the circumstances of the instant case, the juror could have easily been misled by the requested instruction. If the evidence showed that the agents and employees of appellant were lying, then the preliminary hearing at which they also testified would not be valid. While the jurors may of course consider that the magistrate at the preliminary hearing found probable cause, that should be in no way conclusive in the jury's determination of probable cause.

798 So.2d 646 (2001)
Charles SHARRIEF and Millie Sharrief as personal representatives of Quanetta M. Buchannon, deceased
v.
Rebecca GERLACH, M.D.
1991732.
Supreme Court of Alabama.
April 20, 2001.
*648 Sherryl Snodgrass Caffey, Huntsville, for appellants.
John S. Key and Jenny L. McLeroy of Eyster, Key, Tubb, Weaver & Roth, L.L.P., Decatur, for appellee.
HARWOOD, Justice.
Charles Sharrief and Millie Sharrief, as administrators of the estate of Quanetta M. Buchannon, deceased, sued Dr. Rebecca Gerlach, Dr. Charles Giddens, and Jackson County Hospital, seeking compensatory and punitive damages on allegations of a wrongful death, in the defendants' providing medical care to Buchannon.
The trial court entered an "Order of Referral to Mediation." During mediation, the plaintiffs' settled their claims against Dr. Giddens and Jackson County Hospital; the court dismissed those defendants pursuant to a motion and joint stipulation for *649 dismissal. Although he was no longer a party to this case, Dr. Giddens was later a witness at trial.
Trial of the plaintiffs' claims against Dr. Gerlach began on September 27, 1999. When Dr. Gerlach was called by the plaintiffs as their first witness, she ran out of the courtroom. The trial judge offered the plaintiffs the option of continuing the trial in Dr. Gerlach's absence, but they declined to do so. The trial court then declared a mistrial. The plaintiffs then made a motion to tax costs to the defendant, but the trial court denied the motion, on the rationale that the plaintiffs had refused to proceed with the trial in the defendant's absence.
A second trial began on January 24, 2000. On January 27, 2000, the jury returned a verdict for Dr. Gerlach. The trial court entered a judgment based on that verdict. The plaintiffs, without first informing the trial court, subpoenaed the jurors for depositions, based on a suspicion that juror misconduct had occurred during the trial. When the trial court became aware of the subpoenas, it entered an order quashing them. The plaintiffs then filed a "Motion to Alter, Amend, or Vacate" the order quashing the subpoenas, or in the alternative, a "Motion to Take Depositions of Jurors" and a "Motion for Enlargement of Time." The plaintiffs also filed a "Motion to Vacate the Judgment," a "Motion for a New Trial," a "Motion for Post Judgment Hearing," and a "Renewal of Motion to Take Deposition Testimony of Jurors." In response, Dr. Gerlach filed a "Motion for Protective Order" and a "Motion to Strike Affidavits of Mr. Sharrief and Jurors." The trial court heard arguments on all the motions at the same time; it denied all of the plaintiffs' motions, and granted all of Dr. Gerlach's motions.
The plaintiffs appealed. They make a number of disparate arguments; we summarize them into four basic arguments: (1) that the trial court erred in denying their motion to vacate the judgment, or, in the alternative, for a new trial, because, they contend, the jury verdict was plainly and palpably wrong; (2) that the trial court committed reversible error by denying the plaintiffs' posttrial motions concerning discovery regarding jury deliberations; (3) that the trial court committed reversible errors during the trial; and (4) that the trial court erred in denying their motion to tax costs to Dr. Gerlach after the first trial had ended.[1]
The record shows that Buchannon, age 19, was brought to the Jackson County Hospital emergency room at 9:05 p.m. on July 2, 1993. She had been suffering from vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea for three days. Dr. Gerlach, an emergency-room physician, obtained Buchannon's medical history and examined her. Buchannon's medical history showed that she had delivered a child by cesarean section on June 27, 1993, at Hellen Keller Hospital in Muscle Shoals. The baby had been delivered by Dr. Jenny Gapultoes. (Dr. Gapultoes and Hellen Keller Hospital were not involved in this case.) Dr. Gerlach's examination indicated that Buchannon was suffering from endometritis, an infection of the uterus, resulting from the cesarean section performed five days earlier. Dr. Gerlach then telephoned Dr. Giddens, the obstetrician-gynecologist ("Ob/Gyn") on call for Jackson County Hospital that *650 night, to discuss the case. Dr. Giddens had also been Buchannon's Ob/Gyn up until two weeks before the delivery, but because Dr. Gapultoes had delivered Buchannon's baby, Dr. Giddens was no longer considered her attending physician. Dr. Gerlach informed Dr. Giddens of Buchannon's condition and of her test results, informed him that Buchannon had requested that he be present, and asked him to come in on Buchannon's behalf. Dr. Giddens declined to come to the emergency room. Dr. Gerlach then advised Dr. Giddens that her recommended course of treatment would include a shot of Rocephin,[2] 1 gram, by intramuscular injection, and a prescription of Doxycycline.[3] Dr. Giddens concurred with the recommended course of treatment. Dr. Gerlach further proposed that Buchannon be released and that she follow up with an Ob/Gyn within a few days. Dr. Gerlach then asked Dr. Giddens to do a "follow-up" examination with Buchannon in 2-4 days, but he declined that request, recommending instead that Buchannon be instructed to return to the physician who had delivered her baby. Dr. Giddens then approved Dr. Gerlach's recommendations for treatment, and that treatment was administered. Buchannon was released from the hospital at 10:45 p.m. The next morning, Buchannon became unconscious and unresponsive; she was rushed by ambulance to Scottsboro Medical Center. On July 3, 1993 at 7:17 a.m., Buchannon was pronounced dead. The official cause of her death was septic shock due to endometritis due to cesarean section.

I. The Verdict and the Denial of the Plaintiffs' Postjudgment Motions

We first consider whether the trial court erred in denying the plaintiffs' motion for a new trial. The plaintiffs based that motion on the argument that the jury's verdict was not supported by the evidence.
"[W]hen the evidence meets the `sufficiency' test, jury verdicts are presumed correct, and this presumption is strengthened by the trial court's denial of a motion for new trial. Therefore, a judgment based upon a jury verdict and sustained by the denial of a post-judgment motion for a new trial, will not be reversed on a weight-of-the-evidence ground unless it is `plainly and palpably' wrong. Ashbee v. Brock, 510 So.2d 214 (Ala.1987). See, also, Jawad v. Granade, 497 So.2d 471 (Ala.1986)."
Alpine Bay Resorts, Inc. v. Wyatt, 539 So.2d 160, 162-63 (Ala.1988).
Thus, this Court will reverse the trial court's denial of the plaintiffs' motion for a new trial only if this Court concludes that the verdict was plainly and palpably wrong. Generally, in order to prove liability in a medical-malpractice case, the plaintiff must show (1) the appropriate standard of care for the treatment supplied by the defendant health-care provider, (2) a deviation from that standard of care by the defendant, and (3) a proximate causal connection between the injury alleged by the plaintiff and the defendant's breach of the standard of care. Looney v. Davis, 721 So.2d 152 (Ala.1998). The plaintiffs presented the testimony of Dr. William E. Garrett, assistant professor of surgery at Meharry Medical College. Dr. Garrett testified that Dr. Gerlach's examination and treatment of Buchannon was below the standard of care. However, Dr. Sherry *651 Squires, associate medical director of the emergency department at Huntsville Hospital, testifying as an expert on behalf of Dr. Gerlach, stated that Dr. Gerlach's treatment of Buchannon met the standard of care. The resolution of conflicts in the evidence rests solely with the trier of fact, in this case, the jury. Jones v. Baltazar, 658 So.2d 420 (Ala.1995); James v. Woolley, 523 So.2d 110, 112 (Ala.1988).
The record contains substantial evidence to support the jury verdict; thus, we must conclude that the verdict was not plainly and palpably wrong. Stokes v. Long-Lewis Ford, Inc., 549 So.2d 51, 52 (Ala.1989); Merrell v. Joe Bullard Oldsmobile, Inc., 529 So.2d 943, 946 (Ala.1988). The trial court did not err in denying the plaintiffs' motion for a new trial.

II. Posttrial Motions Concerning Discovery Regarding Jury Deliberations

We next consider the plaintiffs' argument that the trial court erred in denying their posttrial motions seeking discovery regarding the jury's deliberations. These motions included a motion to subpoena jurors, a motion to vacate the order quashing the juror subpoenas, a motion to take juror depositions, a motion for enlargement of time to take juror depositions, and a motion renewing the plaintiffs' motion to take depositions, affidavits, and oral testimony of jurors. Matters concerning discovery pending appeal are within the trial court's discretion. Rule 27(b), Ala. R. Civ. P. "[R]elief under Rule 27 is discretionary with the trial court, and a trial court's ruling on a Rule 27 petition will not be reversed in the absence of an abuse of discretion." Ex parte Anderson, 644 So.2d 961, 964 (Ala.1994). Even if this Court viewed these subpoena requests as coming within the ambit of Rule 30, Ala. R. Civ. P., the abuse-of-discretion standard would still apply. Home Ins. Co. v. Rice, 585 So.2d 859, 862 (Ala.1991).
After the trial, the plaintiffs had the trial-court clerk issue subpoenas to the jurors, without having gotten the approval of the trial court. In pertinent part, the trial court's order quashing the subpoenas stated:
"The plaintiffs' attorney failed to comply with Rule 27 of the Alabama Rules of Civil Procedure for the taking of the depositions of witnesses pending appeal or before the taking of an appeal if the time therefor has not expired. The plaintiffs filed no motion with the court for authorization to take the depositions. Furthermore, the witnesses subpoenaed by the plaintiffs were jurors and the court is mindful of the special rules of law that apply to the testimony of jurors and policy considerations for these rules of law."
All of the plaintiffs' arguments concerning posttrial discovery regarding the jury's deliberations are based on three affidavits that had been taken before the trial court quashed the subpoenas. The first was the affidavit of Charles Sharrief, Buchannon's father (who also is one of the plaintiffs). Sharrief's affidavit contains a list of statements made to him by some of the jurors after the trial. The trial court found that Mr. Sharrief's affidavit was comprised completely of "hearsay," as that term is defined by Rule 802, Ala. R. Evid. The Court notes that the plaintiffs have not directly challenged, by citation to any authority, the propriety of the trial court's order striking the affidavit of Sharrief on the basis that it contained nothing but hearsay. See Rule 28(a)(5) Ala. R.App. P. Hearsay evidence is not admissible in support of a motion for a new trial, and a new trial will not be granted on the basis of such evidence. Jefferson County v. Kellum, 630 So.2d 426, 427 (Ala.1993). We *652 conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to allow Charles Sharrief's affidavit to support the issuance of subpoenas to individual jurors.
Affidavits were also obtained from two of the jurors, S. and H. Their affidavits contain accounts of some jurors' discussions during deliberations. Rule 606(b), Ala. R. Evid., reads:
"(b) Inquiry Into Validity of Verdict or Indictment. Upon an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not testify in impeachment of the verdict or indictment as to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the jury's deliberations or to the effect of anything upon that or any other juror's mind or emotions as influencing the juror to assent to or dissent from the verdict or indictment or concerning the juror's mental processes in connection therewith, except that a juror may testify on the question whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury's attention or whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror. Nor may a juror's affidavit or evidence of any statement by the juror concerning a matter about which the juror would be precluded from testifying be received for these purposes. Nothing herein precludes a juror from testifying in support of a verdict or indictment."
This Court has stated:
"Generally, affidavits are inadmissible to impeach a jury's verdict. An affidavit showing that extraneous facts influenced the jury's deliberations is admissible; however, affidavits concerning `the debates and discussions of the case by the jury while deliberating thereon' do not fall with this exception."
HealthTrust, Inc. v. Cantrell, 689 So.2d 822, 828 (Ala.1997). See also Ala. R. Evid. 606(b); this rule is substantially similar to Rule 606(b), Fed.R.Evid. In Peveto v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 807 F.2d 486, 489 (5th Cir.1987), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that "by implementing Rule 606(b), Congress has made the policy decision that the social costs of such error are outweighed by the need for finality to litigation." The Seventh Circuit has held that Rule 606(b) is designed "to protect the judicial process from efforts to undermine verdicts by scrutinizing the jurors' thoughts and deliberations." United States v. Ford, 840 F.2d 460, 465 (7th Cir.1988). Other courts of appeals for the federal circuits have stated that Rule 606(b) promotes "free and uninhibited discourse during deliberations." Attridge v. Cencorp Div. of Dover Techs. Int'l, Inc., 836 F.2d 113, 116 (2d Cir.1987); Maldonado v. Missouri Pac. Ry., 798 F.2d 764 (5th Cir.1986).
The plaintiffs misconceive the distinction, under Alabama law, between "extraneous facts," the consideration of which by a jury or jurors may be sufficient to impeach a verdict, and the "debates and discussions of the jury," which are protected from inquiry. This Court's cases provide examples of extraneous facts. This Court has determined that it is impermissible for jurors to define terms, particularly legal terms, by using a dictionary or encyclopedia. See Fulton v. Callahan, 621 So.2d 1235 (Ala.1993); Pearson v. Fomby, 688 So.2d 239 (Ala.1997). Another example of juror misconduct leading to the introduction of extraneous facts sufficient to impeach a jury verdict is an unauthorized visit by jurors to the scene of an automobile accident, Whitten v. Allstate Ins. Co., 447 So.2d 655 (Ala.1984), or to the scene of a crime, Dawson v. State, 710 So.2d 472 (Ala.1997).
The problem characteristic in each of these cases is the extraneous nature *653 of the fact introduced to or considered by the jury. The improper matter someone argues the jury considered must have been obtained by the jury or introduced to it by some process outside the scope of the trial. Otherwise, matters that the jurors bring up in their deliberations are simply not improper under Alabama law, because the law protects debates and discussions of jurors and statements they make while deliberating their decision. CSX Transp. v. Dansby, 659 So.2d 35 (Ala.1995). This Court has also noted that the debates and discussions of the jury, without regard to their propriety or lack thereof, are not extraneous facts that would provide an exception to the general rule of exclusion of juror affidavits to impeach the verdict. Weekley v. Horn, 263 Ala. 364, 82 So.2d 341 (1955).
Nothing contained in the affidavits indicates the jury considered any extraneous facts. All the statements in the affidavits relate to evidence that was presented at trial or to information that was otherwise brought to the attention of the jury during the trial. The affidavits provide no evidence that the jury consulted any outside sources of information regarding the definition of "standard of care," or regarding any other matter. Nothing in either of the affidavits indicates that the jury, or any particular juror, was influenced by any outside source. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the plaintiffs' posttrial motions seeking discovery regarding the jury's deliberations. HealthTrust, Inc. v. Cantrell, 689 So.2d 822 (Ala.1997).

III. Alleged Errors During Trial

The plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred in overruling their objection made pursuant to Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69, (1986), to the defendant's striking all but three of the women on the venire. The plaintiffs' also argue that they made an objection to the composition of the jury and a Batson objection to the striking of the one black member of the venire, but we have found no such objections in the record.
We first address the plaintiffs' claim that Dr. Gerlach violated the principles of Batson by using 7 of her 10 peremptory strikes against women. Because the plaintiffs did not object to the striking of the sole black juror, no other Batson argument has been preserved for our review. Cone Bldrs., Inc. v. Kulesus, 585 So.2d 1284 (Ala.1991); Bruner v. Cawthon, 681 So.2d 161 (Ala.Civ.App.1995). A trial court's ruling on a Batson objection is entitled to great deference, and we will not reverse a judgment because of such a ruling unless it is clearly erroneous. Ex parte Branch, 526 So.2d 609 (Ala.1987). In Batson, the United States Supreme Court held that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits a prosecutor in a criminal case from exercising peremptory strikes to remove black potential jurors from a black defendant's jury solely on the basis of their race. In Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U.S. 614, 111 S.Ct. 2077, 114 L.Ed.2d 660 (1991), the United States Supreme Court extended the Batson principles to civil cases. "The burden of persuasion is initially on the party alleging a discriminatory use of peremptory challenges to establish a prima facie case of discrimination." Thomas v. Diversified Contractors, Inc., 578 So.2d 1254, 1255 (Ala.1991). In J.E.B. v. Alabama, 511 U.S. 127, 114 S.Ct. 1419, 128 L.Ed.2d 89 (1994), the United States Supreme Court further extended Batson to gender-based strikes. "Only after a prima facie showing of discrimination has been established is a trial court under a duty to require an opposing party to provide *654 [gender-]neutral reasons for his peremptory strikes. Thomas at 1255.
The following exchange took place at trial:
MS. CAFFEY: "Your Honor, according to my calculations of the thirty-six potential jurors, Plaintiffs are left with either two or three women; and we would submit for the Court's consideration that three female jurorsthat the striking of the women was done in a sexually biased manner in order to exclude mothers from the jury, and they struck some women but was based upon responses that were given during the jury voir dire [sic]; and we showed that they might be biased in the case, such as, the inability to award a large sum of money, and two or three of them indicatedwell, one indicated that she would not be able to follow the Court's jury instructions and other indications like that. And, also, the Plaintiffs struck two jurors who indicated a knowledge and relationship with Dr. Gerlach as a result of their employment with the Jackson County Hospital, and considering that there would be some information involving the Jackson County Hospital and the fact that they were a Defendant in this case, those jurors were struck because of their potential bias. And that would be jurors V. and M. Juror W. indicatedwell, we didn't strike M., that would be V., but Juror W. indicated thatI believe she indicated that she did not believe that she could be unbiased in this case, and we contend that the three jurorswell, first of all, that women are a representative group in the Jackson County community and that three female jurors out of a potential thirty-six would certainly constitute less than the percentage of women in the community, and also, it's less than a reasonable percentage of jurors that are left on the jury; and that's one-third of the jury.
MR. KEY [defense attorney]: "Is that a prima facie case, Your Honor?
THE COURT: "Are you saying it is?
MR. KEY: "I'm saying it is not.
THE COURT: "Well, what are your grounds in that regard?
MR. KEY: "Judge, we can give a reason for every strike that we made, but the point is that we had ten strikes, and how many women are left on the jury?
THE COURT: "Three.
MR. KEY: "Well, I'll say this. It's very unusual because it seems like that the last forty cases that I've tried, it's been about eight to three female; but, you know, there's noI just don't see that there's any prima facie case here based onyou do have three women on the jury; and unless we're called to show gender-neutral reasons, then that's as far as I can go because I just don't see it.
MS. CAFFEY: "Well, you struck seven of the female jurors, none of whom gave any indication of being connected with any of the parties.
MR. KEY: "Well, for instance, the last strike, she indicated that she had been treated for diarrhea and vomiting and throwing up and had been put on IVs within four hours; and that's what they're saying that we should've done, and we've got reasons. And if we're forced to go back and reconstruct them, then we can, but
THE COURT: "Well, the Court rules that the Plaintiff [sic] has not made a prima facie case of discrimination in regard to gender. All right; anything further?
MS. CAFFEY: "Your honor, my understanding of the law is that I would have to show that the group would be a representative *655 group in the community and that the defendants abused strikes in a manner ... which left the number of jurors on the jury in this representative group less than the percentage of that group in the community; and I've clearly shown that. I have also offered the Court an explanation insofar as the striking of female jurors by the Plaintiffs and have shown sex-neutral reasons; and the Defendant has indicated that they would have to put together some reasons for the striking, and
THE COURT: "Well, that was not my understanding of the statement made by defense counsel. All right; that's my ruling. Do you have anything further?
MS. CAFFEY: "No, Your Honor."
The plaintiffs' only objection regarding the defendant's strikes of women, if it can be characterized as an objection, was to the fact that only three women were left on the jury. However, "`"[I]t is important that the defendant come forward with facts, not just numbers alone, when asking the [trial] court to find a prima facie case"' of ... discrimination." McElemore v. State, 798 So.2d 693, 696 (Ala.Crim.App. 2000) (quoting Mitchell v. State, 579 So.2d 45, 48 (Ala.Crim.App.1991), in turn quoting United States v. Moore, 895 F.2d 484, 485 (8th Cir.1990)). Based on the record, we conclude that the plaintiffs did not present a prima facie case of improper strikes on the basis of gender. In Ex parte Trawick, 698 So.2d 162 (Ala.1997), this Court reasoned:
"Trawick has offered no evidence that the female veniremembers shared only the characteristics of gender, that anything in the type or manner of the prosecutor's statements or questions during the extensive voir dire indicated an intent to discriminate against female jurors, that there was a lack of meaningful voir dire directed at the female jurors, or that female jurors and male jurors were treated differently. He has offered no evidence that the prosecutor had a history of using peremptory challenges in a manner that discriminated against veniremembers of either gender. Instead, Trawick has merely emphasized that the State used many of its strikes to remove women from the venire. Without more, we do not find that the number of strikes this prosecutor used to remove women from the venire is sufficient to establish a prima facie case of gender discrimination."
698 So.2d at 168. The reasoning of Trawick applies here. We have reviewed the trial transcript, and our review indicates the plaintiffs presented nothing to show a prima facie case of gender discrimination. Therefore, the trial court was not required to have the defense provide gender-neutral reasons for its peremptory strikes. We conclude that the trial court acted within its discretion in denying the plaintiffs' Batson motion.
The plaintiffs also argue that the trial court erred in excluding their Exhibit 5 ("Defendant's Medical Record" annotated by Dr. William Garrett during trial) and their Exhibit 7 (pamphlets on Rocephin and Doxycycline). However, the plaintiffs made no objections at trial to the exclusion of these exhibits, and this Court will not consider objections to the exclusion of evidence that were not raised at trial. Zielke v. AmSouth Bank, N.A., 703 So.2d 354, 361 (Ala.Civ.App.1996); Bolen v. Hoven, 143 Ala. 652, 39 So. 379 (1905). We note further that the plaintiffs' brief contains no citations to authority supporting their contentions. See Rule 28(a)(5), Ala. R.App. P.; McLemore v. Fleming, 604 So.2d 353 (Ala.1992).
*656 The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.
AFFIRMED.
MOORE, C.J., and SEE, BROWN, and STUART, JJ., concur.
NOTES
[1]  The Court will not address this fourth issue, because the plaintiffs' brief contains no citations to authority supporting their contentions. Rule 28(a)(5), Ala.R.App.P., specifically requires an appellant to present the appellate court with citations to authorities supporting the appellant's contentions. When an appellant fails to comply with Rule 28(a)(5), Ala. R.App. P., this Court may affirm the ruling the appellant is complaining of. McLemore v. Fleming, 604 So.2d 353 (Ala.1992).

TRAPP, P.J.
Defendant Erie City Iron Works, hereinafter designated Erie, appeals from a judgment in the sum of $30,818.50 entered in favor of the plaintiff upon the verdict of a jury against Erie and T.A. Brinkoetter & Sons, Inc. Other disposition has been made as to the case against the latter and we consider only the appeal of Erie.
Plaintiff's action was for property damage in the approximate amount of the judgment incurred as the result of the explosion of a gas-fired boiler manufactured by Erie and installed by Brinkoetter. At the time of the explosion installation had just been completed and was at the stage of the initial start-up and adjustment of the boiler. Title to it had not yet passed to the plaintiff.
The defendant's theory is that defendant was not guilty of the negligence that was the proximate cause of plaintiff's damages; that the court should have directed a verdict in favor of this defendant, or granted defendant's post-trial motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict of the jury or, in the alternative, should have granted defendant a new trial of the issues, because of error committed by the court in submitting, to the jury, both Count I and Count II of plaintiff's complaint, which respectively were predicated upon a res ipsa loquitur theory and specific negligence theory; that there was error by the court in denying defendant's motion for mistrial because of prejudicial conduct of counsel; that conduct of *147 a juror was prejudicial to defendant; and that there was error by the court in giving certain instructions to the jury; and other errors hereinafter discussed.
Plaintiff purchased the boiler as a "package" boiler fabricated by Erie at its plant and shipped assembled for installation as a complete unit with automatic firing controls built on.
The fire control unit and the main motorized valve were not manufactured by Erie but were purchased by it and affixed to the fabricated boiler. The Brinkoetter contract called for it to install the boiler and connect it to the line bringing gas into the building.
In making the installation, Brinkoetter did not install what has been called a "dirt leg," i.e., a trap consisting of a length of pipe extending beyond the point where a vertical gas line is turned so that it travels horizontally. Its function is to catch condensed moisture and debris in the gas line. Plaintiff had retained consulting engineers to design and supervise installation of the boiler. The schematic drawing provided by the engineer did not show a "dirt leg." The latter testified that the contractor should install a "dirt leg" whether drawn in the plans or not. Officers of Brinkoetter say that it puts in dirt legs when the plans call for them, otherwise it does not.
Neither the fabricated boiler nor the connecting line, as installed, included a "strainer," which is described as a distinctive appearing section of pipe containing a screen, the function of which is to catch debris which might be carried through the line by the flow of gas. When used, it is installed in the line ahead of the valves and controls. A brochure of the valve manufacturer recommended that a strainer be placed ahead of the main valve. Such a strainer was not included in the unit fabricated by Erie. The consulting engineer's schematic drawing did not include a strainer. He testified that he would have included it if he had known that a strainer was recommended. An officer of Brinkoetter testified that he had never heard *148 of a strainer in a gas line. In behalf of the latter, its foreman and employes testified that as the gas line was being installed, steps were taken to knock loose the scale and clean the connecting pipe. It appears that the installation was nearly completed when the contractor was advised by the gas company foreman that it would be necessary to install a regulator, i.e., a device which lowered the pressure from the 35-pound pressure in the main to some 10 pounds as specified by the boiler. A used regulator was available at the hospital and was installed. At first it did not function, but after some adjustment was observed to be reducing the pressure. It was not tested after the explosion. In installing the regulator at this time, it was necessary to cut the gas line with a torch and weld on a section of pipe. It does not appear what, if anything, was done to inspect for and remove debris in the pipe following this operation. There is some conflict in the evidence as to whether or not welding slag would enter the pipe by reason of this work.
Under the terms of its contract with Erie, plaintiff elected to have the services of a start-up engineer. Upon notification of the completion of the installation such engineer, one Enders, was sent by Erie. The explosion in issue occurred at 11:40 a.m. on Thursday, September 25, 1958. In summary, it appears that Enders had arrived on the preceding Tuesday, that the boiler was started up and fired for some 20 hours and then shut down, and that on the morning of the 25th it had been started up and fired for some 2 hours preceding the explosion. Enders died following the explosion, apparently as the result of injuries sustained.
With regard to the things done during this period, one Binns, a member of the hospital maintenance staff, testified that Enders started the boiler operation, handled the controls and made adjustments, and that immediately prior to the explosion Enders was making an adjustment of the water level in the boiler. Charles Fearn, foreman *149 of the gas distribution crew of the utility company which was working on the exterior gas line, testified that he had been in the boiler room during the morning and Enders had told him that the boiler was on low fire or "no load" firing, and that he was going to test the boiler on high fire, asking Fearn to time the meter outside so that there could be a measurement of the cubic feet of gas entering the boiler on high fire. No specific arrangement was made as to when this would be done.
Following the explosion, a State boiler inspector, and representatives of the interested parties, together with engineers and experts retained by them, assembled at the scene to examine the boiler which had been kept undisturbed. Several of them testified that they had noticed the absence of the dirt leg and the screen in the gas line connected to the boiler. The main valve was examined as to its external indicator and the testimony varies from the statement that it was apparently closed, through slightly open to one-third open. The boiler inspector testified that he assumed that it was open. It does not appear that any organized procedure was followed so that each expert present observed all of the matters testified to.
The main valve was then disassembled. Most witnesses testified to observing some scale and several pieces of welding slag on both the upstream and downstream sides of the valve.
There is testimony that upon examination of the several parts of the valve, a resilient neoprene seal was observed to be indented and that the stainless steel seat of the valve was scored to a depth of 1/16th of an inch or so, the width of the indentation being that of a blade of a table knife. There is other testimony that the seat bore only normal scratches. It does not appear that tests were made to determine whether the indentations on the neoprene seal coincided with the scoring of the valve seat. At the trial the neoprene seal no longer bore any indentation. *150 This was explained as being due to the resilient nature of the substance. The steel valve seat was not produced at the trial.
The consensus of the testimony is that there was a gas explosion followed by an explosion of the boiler itself. The opinion testimony is that the first explosion resulted from the ignition of a surplus of gas within the combustion chamber, which gas was somehow ignited. Paul Wilson, an employe of Erie in charge of their service department, testified that he did not believe it possible to find the actual cause of the majority of explosion cases, and George Harper, a professor of engineering at the University of Illinois, testified that in such an explosion things are so disrupted that it cannot be ascertained with certainty what happened, but that it was necessary to draw deductions.
From the record it appears that a variety of factors inducing the explosion may have existed. There is, of course, the contradictory nature of the testimony as to whether or not the motorized main valve was closed or open, whether or not slag from welding had lodged in the main valve so that it was not completely closed, and whether such slag would be sufficient to hold the valve open with the pressures concerned without distorting the valve stem, which apparently was in normal condition.
There is testimony by Ted Brinkoetter that the control system, upon being tested, did not always work, but there is also testimony that it functioned correctly upon tests. Harry Reynolds, an investigating engineer retained by the plaintiff, testified that it would take a very small amount of gas to cause an explosion in this boiler, and that it was particularly hazardous to operate the boiler on a "no load" basis as the mixture of air and gas gets out of balance and becomes explosive. He also testified that upon initial examination, the oil burning switch was on instead of the gas burning switch. A witness, testifying in behalf of Brinkoetter, stated that shortly before the explosion, *151 Enders flipped a switch and that the flame in the boiler went out and did not come on again.
It is one of defendant's arguments that by this contract it was to furnish a package boiler but had no responsibility for its installation. This position was taken in its first motion to the complaint and is argued here.
The nature of defendant's disclaimer seems to be based upon its Exhibit #1 contained in a foreword to the instruction manual which Erie shipped with the boiler. A relevant part includes the following:
"When the service of an Erie City Iron Works Engineer is provided for the customer, it is for the purpose of aiding in the training of the customer's personnel and not to replace them or assume any of their duties. It should be understood that the responsibility for operation rests solely with the customer's operators and the Erie City Iron Works assumes no responsibility for the customer's operators' failure to properly perform their respective duties, and the presence of an Erie City Iron Works Engineer at the customer's plant in no way relieves the customer's personnel of any of their responsibilities."
The following also appears in slightly varying form in several places in the contract for the purchase of the boiler:
"With respect to all preliminary operations, initial start-up, demonstration of capacity and performance guarantees, representatives of the Company are authorized only to advise and consult with the Purchaser or its representatives and no representative of the Company is licensed to operate the equipment. In the event the Purchaser shall operate the equipment specified hereunder prior to final acceptance, the Purchaser shall indemnify and save harmless the Company against any loss or expense and against any liability imposed upon the Company, resulting *152 from the operation of such equipment by the Purchaser prior to final acceptance, except any such loss, expense or liability for injury or damage resulting from the negligent acts or omissions of the Company or its agents or employees." (Emphasis supplied).
It appears from the testimony that the package boiler is not operational upon delivery but requires adjustment to make it perform properly. Paul Wilson, who is in charge of field service for defendant, testified that the linkage of the butterfly valve regulating the ratio of air and gas must be adjusted and that the damper linkage must be "positioned." He testified that the service engineer never operates the boiler but that it is the obligation of the purchaser to make such adjustments according to the engineer's instructions. He testified that it was the service engineer's duty to make a visual check of the gas line installed, check the controls and firing equipment, consult and assist placing the boiler in service, instruct in operating the boiler and its controls and assist in making the final adjustments.
Brewster, a witness for Brinkoetter, testified that Enders examined the pipeline but made no suggestions for changes in the work as installed, and the record is that Enders did, in fact, start-up and fire the boiler, make adjustments, and made or had arranged to make the tests, including the testing of its capacity on the high fire. Binns, an employe of the hospital, testified that no one other than Enders handled or adjusted the controls. The manual submitted by Erie contains a section A designated "Preparing the boiler for service  Inspection of unit." Section A-1 states that prior to placing equipment in service a complete inspection should be made to determine its condition and continues:
"In case of newly constructed power equipment, this inspection should insure that the unit has been correctly completed."
*153 Section A-2 is as follows:
"Responsibility for the completion of construction normally rests with the customer's construction engineer working in conjunction with the manufacturer's erection or service engineer. At completion of construction work, an inspection should be made in the presence of the customer's construction engineer, operating engineer, the construction superintendent and the manufacturer's engineer (if one is present) and agreement reached that the equipment is in a satisfactory condition for placing into service."
There is no evidence that such inspection or agreement was reached or called for by defendant's service engineer.
As to the contention that by contract Erie had no responsibility, claimed under its Exhibit #1, the "foreword" to the instruction manual and the several provisions set out in the contract should not control under these circumstances. The effect of these documents might be that Erie could not be required to perform the tests and effect the start-up of the boiler, but they should not control liability where under the evidence it might be reasonable to conclude that they did, in fact, undertake and perform the work. The contract provision quoted does not attempt to exclude negligence of Erie employes.
Erie discusses Count I of the complaint as involving the principles of res ipsa loquitur under a pleading of general negligence. These principles are thoroughly discussed in Metz v. Central Illinois Electric & Gas Co., 32 Ill.2d 446, 207 NE2d 305, and need not be reiterated.
[1] Erie urges that the inference of negligence under Count I should not be allowed because the boiler was not under its exclusive control. The defendant points out that the evidence discloses that Enders, Brewster, an employe of Brinkoetter, Binns, an employe of the hospital, and Robert Brinkoetter were all present at the time of the explosion. The evidence has been examined to determine *154 what, if anything, these individuals were doing to exercise control of the unit. We cannot say that it is contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence for the jury to conclude that Erie's man Enders was, in fact, in control of the proceedings incident to the start-up and testing of the boiler. There is no evidence that any person other than Enders participated in any phase of the work.
In May v. Columbian Rope Co., 40 Ill. App.2d 264, 189 NE2d 394, the complaint alleged the purchase and delivery of a new rope which broke shortly after placing the rope into use. There was judgment n.o.v. entered by the trial court. The Appellate Court reversed, holding that the inference of negligence under the theory of res ipsa loquitur was properly applicable. As to that defendant's contention that it was not in control of the rope at the time of the injury, the court said:
"Decisions from other states and recent cases here reject this inflexible application of a rule of control and hold that a defendant in a res ipsa loquitur case cannot automatically defeat an allegation of negligence with a bare showing that, before harm struck, it had parted with control of the harmful instrumentality. (Prosser, Torts 206 (2d ed 1955).)
"The demonstrable trend of these authorities is to determine from the nature of the defective instrumentality and the surrounding circumstances whether the inference of the defendant's negligence is strong enough to survive the fact that, between the defendant's control and the plaintiff's injury, another possession intervened."
The court continued to say that it was for the determination of the jury as to whether the permissive inference of negligence arising from the facts was to prevail over defendant's countervailing proof of due care.
As stated in Prosser, Law of Torts, 2d ed 1955, p 206, chap 7, § 42, the word "control" may be the wrong word. It is said:

*155 "Some courts have said that it is enough that the defendant was in exclusive control at the time of the indicated negligence. It would be far better, and much confusion would be avoided, if the idea of `control' were discarded altogether, and we were to say merely that the apparent cause of the accident must be such that the defendant would be responsible for any negligence connected with it."
In Schroeder v. City & County Sav. Bank of Albany, 293 NY 370, 57 NE2d 57, the defendants were several contractors and the owner of a building under repair. The court noted:
"It is not necessary for the applicability of the res ipsa loquitur doctrine that there be but a single person in control of that which caused the damage."
Amongst other cases defendant relies upon Kirchner v. Kuhlman, 334 Ill. App. 339, 79 NE2d 628. There defendant's employes were working on plaintiff's premises but we find no evidence that these defendants had control of the trash container belonging to the plaintiff in which the fire started. Again, in Krump v. Highlander Ice Cream Co., 30 Ill. App.2d 103, 173 NE2d 822, the collision of two automobiles caused one of them to strike and damage plaintiff's building. While the court said that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur did not apply, it did hold that there was a presumption of negligence where an accident occurred which would not ordinarily occur if due care had been taken, and that it was proper to call upon the defendants to exculpate themselves. The distinction between this conclusion and the theory of res ipsa loquitur appears slight.
[2] Defendant argues that Count I of the complaint alleged general negligence stating a cause of action upon the theory of res ipsa loquitur, while Count II alleges certain acts of specific negligence, and that under the authorities in this State the inference of negligence which *156 arises under res ipsa loquitur, "vanishes" upon the introduction of evidence of specific negligence. Amongst the authorities cited are Bollenbach v. Bloomenthal, 341 Ill. 539, 173 NE 670. This rule has been categorically overruled by our Supreme Court in Metz v. Central Illinois Electric & Gas Co., 32 Ill.2d 446, 207 NE2d 305. In that case the complaint charged general negligence in one count employing the theory of res ipsa loquitur, and in a second count alleged specific negligence. At the close of the evidence plaintiff was required to, or did elect, to rely upon the charge of negligence and the theory of res ipsa loquitur. The verdict for the plaintiff was reversed in the Appellate Court on the theory that res ipsa loquitur did not apply as other parties had access to the area of the gas main. In reversing the Appellate Court, the Supreme Court remarked upon the conflict amongst the Illinois decisions. We may note that many of these decisions are in broad language open to a variety of interpretations, and frequently they do not indicate the reason for the decision. In Metz the Supreme Court concluded that the more studied, more just view is that the inference of negligence does not vanish when contrary evidence appears, but that it remains to be considered and weighed by the jury against the direct evidence offered by the party charged, citing Cobb v. Marshall Field & Co., 22 Ill. App.2d 143, 159 NE2d 520; Illinois Pattern Jury Instruction, 22.01 with comment on pages 128, 129; Prosser, 20 Minn L Rev, 241. See also O'Hara v. Central Illinois Light Co., 319 Ill. App. 336, 49 NE2d 274; May v. Columbian Rope Co., 40 Ill. App.2d 264, 189 NE2d 394.
[3] Defendant's contention that plaintiff should have been required to elect as between the counts is controlled by the rule of Metz. Defendant's authorities are Wm. Wrigley, Jr. Co. v. Standard Roofing Co., 325 Ill. App. 210, 59 NE2d 510; and Simmons v. South Shore Hospital, 340 Ill. App. 153, 91 NE2d 135. In the former case the Appellate Court undertook to specify what may be described *157 as the requirements that plaintiff elect between the general negligence count and the count for specific negligence. The only cited authority for such procedure was Bollenbach v. Bloomenthal and its rule that the inference of negligence vanished upon the introduction of evidence of specific negligence. By reason of the Metz decision, this reason for such rule no longer exists. Simmons v. South Shore Hospital, as well as Jackson v. 919 Corp., 344 Ill. App. 519, 101 NE2d 594, simply relied upon the rule of Wrigley as authority without discussing it.
There is, in fact, persuasive opinion contrary to the contention of Erie regarding the theory of election in Erckman v. Northern Illinois Gas Co., 61 Ill. App.2d 137, 210 NE2d 42. There premises were damaged by an explosion of gas leaking from the company lines. The complaint alleged only specific negligence and there was some evidence of a failure of periodic inspection. The trial court gave an instruction authorizing the jury to apply, or employ, the inference of negligence under res ipsa loquitur. The Appellate Court reversed since there was no pleading of general negligence, but stated that upon a new trial the complaint should be amended to include such an allegation. The court there said:
"An inference of general negligence arising from the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is not necessarily inconsistent with proof of specific negligence. To hold that proof of specific negligence precludes the application of the res ipsa doctrine could lead to the absurd result of weak proof of specific negligence voiding a strong inference of general negligence.... If there is an inference of general negligence and proof of specific negligence, but reasonable men may differ as to the effect of this evidence, it should then be for a jury to determine under which theory, if any, the plaintiff should prevail. McCormick v. Kopmann, 23 Ill.2d 189, 205, 161 NE2d 720 (3rd Dist 1959)."
*158 [4] The Illinois courts recognize that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is but one form of circumstantial evidence. May v. Columbian Rope Co., 40 Ill. App.2d 264, 189 NE2d 394.
It has been suggested that the doctrine that requires election assumes that the inference arising through res ipsa loquitur must be an alternative to direct proof rather than a type of circumstantial evidence to be weighed with other evidence, and it has been criticised as an assumption that the pleader must be totally ignorant of the facts. 2 ALR3d 1335, at 1340. There is reason in the hypothesis that there should not be a penalty imposed upon the pleader for placing before the court all facts known to him. 27 Fordham L Rev, 411-415; Foster v. Union Starch & Refining Co., 11 Ill. App.2d 346, 137 NE2d 499. This is particularly true when an allegation notifies the defendant of the intent to rely upon the inference of negligence arising under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. It is the policy under the rule of Metz v. Central Illinois Electric & Gas Co., 32 Ill.2d 446, 207 NE2d 305, that once the inference of negligence arises through allegations of general negligence, it remains for the consideration of the jury, unless and until the precise cause of the injury is established. 27 Fordham L Rev 411. In Prosser, Law of Torts, 2d ed, chap 7, § 43, p 214, it is suggested:
"It is quite generally agreed that the introduction of evidence which does not purport to furnish a complete explanation of the occurrence does not deprive the plaintiff of res ipsa loquitur."
In Cassady v. Old Colony St. Ry. Co., 184 Mass. 156, 68 NE 10, at p 12, the court said:
"The defendant also contends that, even if originally the doctrine would have been applicable, the plaintiff had lost or waived her rights under that doctrine, because, instead of resting her case solely upon it, she undertook to go further, and show particularly *159 the cause of the accident. This position is not tenable. It is true that, where the evidence shows the precise cause of the accident, (citing authorities), there is, of course, no room for the application of the doctrine of presumption. The real cause being shown, there is no occasion to inquire as to what the presumption would have been as to it if it had not been shown. But if, at the close of the evidence, the cause does not clearly appear, or if there is a dispute as to what it is, then it is open to the plaintiff to argue upon the whole evidence, and the jury are justified in relying upon presumptions, unless they are satisfied that the cause has been shown to be inconsistent with it. An unsuccessful attempt to prove by direct evidence the precise cause does not estop the plaintiff from relying upon the presumptions applicable to it."
We believe that this position was approached in Krueger v. Richardson, 326 Ill. App. 205, 61 NE2d 399, when the court noted that the plaintiff was not required to prove the specific acts of negligence as alleged, but they had a right to rely upon the proof and its reasonable inferences to establish a prima facie case of general negligence.
In this case it seems proper to say that reasonable men might differ as to the effect of the evidence heard by the jury. Expert witnesses would not even undertake to announce an hypothesis, but rather advised of the virtual impossibility of reaching a specific determination of what caused the explosion. This situation here appears to be precisely that contemplated in the language of Erckman v. Northern Illinois Gas Company.
[5] In its reply brief Erie contends that the doctrine cannot be followed because there are multiple defendants. No Illinois cases seem applicable as precedent. In Schroeder v. City & County Sav. Bank of Albany, 293 NY 370, 57 NE2d 57, it was held error to dismiss a complaint seeking to apply res ipsa loquitur as against three defendants. *160 See also Burr v. Sherwin-Williams Co. (Cal App), 258 P.2d 58, 38 ALR2d 905 et seq. Again in Zichler v. St. Louis Public Service Co., 332 Mo 902, 59 S.W.2d 654, general negligence was pleaded against the service company while specific negligence was pleaded as to another defendant who was found not guilty by the jury. It was contended that it was improper to permit the res ipsa loquitur inference to be applied to one joint tort feasor, but not the other. Pointing out that the rule was one of evidence rather than pleading, the court said:
"A plaintiff should not be compelled to confine his action to one joint-feasor only in order to be accorded the rights which the law gives to him."
It being the policy under the rule of Metz that the inference of negligence is to be weighed by the jury with other evidence, we see no reason why the benefit of such rule should be denied to the plaintiff where under the events at issue, more than one party may be the source of injury to the plaintiff for otherwise he would be limited in the use of, or be completely denied the benefit of the rule. In Metz the Supreme Court said that whether the doctrine applies in a given case is a question of law for the trial court. We believe that these conclusions dispose of the contentions of Erie that the court erred in refusing to strike par 8 to Count I.
Defendant contends that the case must be remanded for error in the giving of instructions. His objection to plaintiff's instruction #20 is that it permits the jury to consider the case upon the theory of res ipsa loquitur, as well as upon the allegations of specific negligence. The matters hereinabove discussed dispose of this contention.
[6] There is objection to Brinkoetter's instruction #6 which may be summarized as an issues instruction relating to negligence alleged as to Erie and as to the defendant Brinkoetter. It is contended that as to Erie there is no evidence in the record as to certain matters *161 stated in the instruction to be alleged in the complaint. The Abstract discloses that at the conference on instructions Erie simply made the objection that the evidence did not support all of the charges. This does not meet the rule that specific objections to instructions must be made at the conference on instructions. Vasic v. Chicago Transit Authority, 33 Ill. App.2d 11, 180 NE2d 347. The court's comment indicates that he believed that those matters not supported by the evidence had been omitted from the instruction. Under such circumstances we do not believe that there is reversible error.
[7] Erie urges that the cause must be reversed and remanded by reason of the fact that a juror on voir dire indicated that he was not interested in any lawsuits then pending in court, but that subsequent to the trial, counsel discovered that he had been defendant in a lawsuit and was, at the time of trial, a plaintiff in a pending cause. Erie does not contend that it was, in fact, prejudiced by the juror sitting upon the panel, but says that the prejudicial effect cannot be calculated. It indicates that it could have challenged the juror, though it is not claimed that it would have done so. In Department of Public Works & Buildings v. Christensen, 25 Ill.2d 273, 184 NE2d 884, it was alleged that the party would not have accepted the juror if a true answer had been given. The Supreme Court there held that the motion for a new trial would be denied unless it was shown not only that the juror answered falsely, but also that prejudice resulted. Erie cites the case of People v. Ortiz, 320 Ill. 205, 150 NE 708, which may be distinguished because in that case the juror had actually expressed hostility to the defendant which he had concealed.
[8] Erie urges that the judgment must be reversed because of a reference to insurance introduced during cross-examination in behalf of the defendant Brinkoetter. One George Harper testified in behalf of the plaintiff as an expert witness who had examined the boiler following *162 the explosion. It appears that he had originally been requested to make the examination by a representative of the company insuring Erie. The name of the insurance company was given in answer to a question to whom he had delivered his report. The trial court sustained an objection to a question as to what party was covered and an objection as to whether the insurance company represented Erie. The trial court, while indicating disapproval of counsel's action, denied the motion for a mistrial.
It is clear that plaintiff did not, in any way, precipitate this issue. Under the circumstances of this case, the proceedings clearly indicated to the jury that certain insurance companies were to be the beneficiaries of a judgment for plaintiff. This fact would seem to indicate little probability of prejudice as between insurance companies upon the issue of liability. Edwards v. Hill-Thomas Lime Co., 378 Ill. 180, 37 NE2d 801.
Upon the possibility of prejudice regarding the issue of damages, the amount of the verdict is slightly less than the amount paid by plaintiff to Erie for the boiler. Insofar as counsel may have attempted to create prejudice as between the parties defendant, the verdict of the jury is joint and they seem to make no distinction. Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that there was no abuse of discretion by the trial court in refusing to grant a mistrial. Isenhart v. Seibert, 6 Ill. App.2d 220, 127 NE2d 469.
[9] Upon consideration of the issues of law, we conclude that the trial court did not err in refusing to direct a verdict or enter a judgment n.o.v. upon the several motions made by Erie, and that, from an examination of the evidence, the verdict of the jury is not contrary to the manifest weights of the evidence.
Taken with the case was plaintiff's motion to dismiss as a "use plaintiff" the Niagara Fire Insurance Company. The effect of such dismissal is to reduce the amount of *163 the judgment in the sum of $4,873.05. The motion is allowed and the judgment ordered reduced in said amount.
The judgment of the trial court is affirmed, but the cause is remanded with directions to enter judgment in the amount due by reason of the dismissal of the party plaintiff pursuant to motion.
Affirmed as modified.

MARVIN T. BURTON, JR. Defendant Below, Appellant,
v.
STATE OF DELAWARE, Plaintiff Below, Appellee.
No. 335, 2008
Supreme Court of Delaware.
Submitted: January 28, 2009.
Decided: March 4, 2009.
Before STEELE, Chief Justice, JACOBS and RIDGELY, Justices.

ORDER
JACK B. JACOBS, Justice.
This 4th day of March 2009, upon consideration of the briefs of the parties and the record in this case, it appears to the Court that:
1. Marvin Burton, the defendant below, appeals from the denial by the Superior Court of a Rule 61 motion for post-conviction relief. On appeal, Burton argues that the trial court erroneously denied that motion which was based, in part, on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Given the serious nature of the charges, the fact that Burton's Rule 61 motion was filed pro se, and that the alleged new evidence has not yet been considered by the Superior Court, we remand for further proceedings limited to Burton's ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
2. Burton was arrested on October 6, 2004, and indicted on October 25, 2004 on charges of First Degree Rape, Second Degree Rape and Second Degree Unlawful Sexual Contact. Burton's daughter, the alleged victim, who was eleven years old at the relevant times, claimed that on at least three occasions Burton had sexually abused and raped her. All three incidents allegedly occurred while the victim was staying at Burton's parents' house in 2004, with the two most serious incidents allegedly occurring in August 2004. Trial began on August 8, 2005. On August 11, 2005 Burton was convicted on all charges.
3. Because of prior convictions for Third Degree Burglary and Third Degree Unlawful Sexual Intercourse, the State moved to declare Burton an habitual offender under 11 Del. C. § 4214.[1] On October 28, 2005, the Superior Court declared Burton an habitual offender and sentenced him to life in prison for each of the two Rape charges, plus two additional years imprisonment for the Unlawful Sexual Contact charge. The Superior Court also imposed special conditions, including a no contact order and sex offender registration.
4. After sentencing, defense counsel filed a notice of appeal on Burton's behalf and a motion to withdraw pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 26(c). The State filed a motion to affirm. After reviewing the record, this Court determined that Burton's appeal was "wholly without merit and devoid of any arguably appealable issue" and granted the motion to affirm.[2]
5. On August 16, 2007 Burton moved pro se for post-conviction relief, raising multiple claims including ineffective assistance of counsel.[3] Burton alleged that his trial counsel was incompetent, failed to interview and subpoena key defense witnesses, and did not allow Burton to testify. On September 4, 2007, trial counsel filed a sworn letter memorandum responding to that motion. Trial counsel explained that he did not mislead Burton or refuse to allow him to testify. Rather, he advised Burton not to take the stand for the strategic purpose of avoiding cross-examination on Burton's prior convictions. After receiving that advice, Burton agreed and chose not to testify. Trial counsel further explained that he did, in fact, contact most of the witnesses Burton claimed were not interviewed or subpoenaed, and found that those witnesses either could not provide the testimony Burton claimed, or that they had no information helpful to Burton's defense.
6. On June 3, 2008, the Superior Court denied Burton's motion without a hearing, finding that Burton's arguments were all without merit.[4] On June 30, Burton filed a notice of appeal, pro se, and on August 14, appellate counsel entered an appearance on his behalf.
7. Although Burton advanced numerous claims of error in his motion for post-conviction relief, on appeal he advances only onethat the Superior Court erred by denying his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, Burton limits that claim to the contention that trial counsel was ineffective by failing to contact, properly interview and subpoena material witnesses, and also by refusing to allow Burton to testify at trial.[5]
8. The State has moved to strike certain affidavits and information included in Burton's appendix that were not part of the record on appeal. These affidavits include: (i) a statement by Marvin Burton, Sr. "that he was not contacted, interviewed or subpoenaed concerning the fact that the alleged victim . . . did not live in our residence from late July through September 2004"; and (ii) a statement by Stacie Brittingham (Burton's sister) that she was not interviewed before the day of trial concerning her testimony, and that the alleged victim did not live in her parent's residence from late July through September 2004 and that that issue was not raised in questioning during her testimony at trial. Also included was a statement by Eric Morris that (i) "he was not contacted, interviewed or called as a witness concerning the fact that the alleged victim . . . did not live at Marvin Burton, Sr. and Vivian Burton's residence from late July through September 2004;" and that (ii) "I would also have testified that [the alleged victim] lived with me approximately 3 weeks during the end of July and August 2004 and she stayed with other individuals until the month of September 2004. . . ."
9. As a general matter, the record on appeal may not be supplemented by affidavits relating facts and circumstances that were not fairly presented to the trial court,[6] and we will not consider such supplemental affidavits. For new evidence to be considered, a party should file a motion to remand to the trial court to determine the facts in light of their new evidence.[7] Here, however, Burton moved for post-conviction relief pro se, without the evidence having been considered by the Superior Court. In such circumstances, some leeway should be granted if, in the interests of justice, the new evidence ought to be considered.[8] For that purpose a remand is appropriate.
NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that this matter is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings limited to the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Jurisdiction is not retained.

3 Md. App. 266 (1968)
238 A.2d 920
MELVIN HENRY GREEN
v.
WARDEN, MARYLAND HOUSE OF CORRECTION.
No. 102, September Term, 1967.
Court of Special Appeals of Maryland.
Decided February 28, 1968.
Before MURPHY, C.J., and ANDERSON, MORTON, ORTH, and THOMPSON, JJ.
PER CURIAM:
This is an application for leave to appeal from an order filed on July 21, 1967, by Judge Robert I.H. Hammerman, sitting *268 in the Criminal Court of Baltimore, denying relief sought under the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act.
As stated by Judge Hammerman in his memorandum opinion, the applicant raised the following contentions:
1. That petitioner was the subject of an illegal arrest for the reasons that:
a. He was not a resident of the house in which he was arrested,
b. The police had no probable cause to arrest him,
c. That the narcotics were found in the hall of the home in which he was arrested and he was charged with their possession.
2. That the police gave perjured testimony at the time of trial.
3. That he was not properly represented by his court appointed lawyer.
Judge Hammerman stated that:
"Petitioner's counsel conceded at the outset and at the conclusion of the hearing that the first two grounds were not proper subjects for review on Post Conviction, that she understood that these issues were raised at the time of trial, and that she was not pressing them at this time."
The mere fact of an illegal arrest is not grounds for relief under the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act, Slater v. Warden, 233 Md. 609, as the legality of the arrest is immaterial where no fruits of the arrest are introduced into evidence at the trial against the accused; Ogle v. Warden, 236 Md. 425, but where the petitioner alleges, as he seems to do in this case, that evidence was seized as a result of the illegal arrest, this constitutes an allegation of an illegal search and seizure and may properly be raised under the Act. Davis v. Warden, 232 Md. 670; Fennell v. Warden. 236 Md. 423; Austin v. Director, 237 Md. 314. Since this issue was not pressed at the hearing, it can be considered as abandoned. Szukiewicz v. Warden, 1 Md. App. 61. However, we note that the lower court found that there was nothing in the testimony of the applicant to indicate *269 that his arrest was illegal. Since applicant did not carry his burden of proof, the arrest must be considered as legal. Thus, the allegation of an illegal search and seizure would also fail since further evidence to support this contention was not offered.
Judge Hammerman states that the rule as to incompetence of counsel is "that it is only when the representation is so deficient as to make a farce out of the trial that an accused is entitled to a new trial." Although this was the former rule in Maryland, the Court of Appeals has expanded this rule in Slater v. Warden, 241 Md. 668, so as to give a more comprehensive definition to that rule. The more preferable rule now is that counsel is incompetent when under all the circumstances of the particular case the petitioner has not been afforded "a genuine and effective representation." Turner v. State, 303 F.2d 507 (4th Cir.1962); Turner v. State, 318 F.2d 852 (4th Cir.1963); Slater v. Warden, supra; Jones v. Warden, 244 Md. 720; Nash v. Warden, 243 Md. 700. This is the rule that is now being followed by the Maryland Court of Special Appeals. Groh v. Warden, 1 Md. App. 674; Charles v. State, 1 Md. App. 222; Norris v. Warden, 1 Md. App. 69; Cherrix v. Warden, 1 Md. App. 65.
However, even under this more comprehensive rule, the trial counsel for applicant was not incompetent. Judge Hammerman found that "the court clearly does not find that (counsel) was in any way incompetent or negligent in the performance of his duties as attorney for the petitioner. Quite the contrary in the case. The court feels that (counsel) did a more than adequate job in defending the petitioner, as the testimony clearly demonstrates."
As to the second contention, we accept the lower court's finding that this was a bald allegation as no evidence was offered to support it at the hearing. Thus it cannot constitute grounds for relief. McCoy v. Warden, 1 Md. App. 108.
Application denied.

            Appeal from the PCRA Order Entered December 21, 2017
               In the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County
               Criminal Division at No: CP-15-CR-0002120-2007


BEFORE: OLSON, STABILE, JJ., and FORD ELLIOTT, P.J.E.

OPINION BY STABILE, J.:                            FILED FEBRUARY 26, 2019

        Appellant, Prince Isaac, appeals from the December 21, 2017 order

denying relief pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief Act (“PCRA”), 42

Pa.C.S.A. §§ 9541-46. We affirm.

        Appellant represented himself at trial after a defective waiver-of-counsel

colloquy—the trial court never apprised Appellant of the elements of the

charged offenses.1 Appointed direct appeal counsel did not raise this issue.

On collateral review, Appellant claimed direct appeal counsel rendered

1  “To ensure that the defendant’s waiver of the right to counsel is knowing,
voluntary, and intelligent, the judge […] shall elicit […] that the defendant
understands the nature of the charges against the defendant and the elements
of each of those charges[.]” Pa.R.Crim.P. 121(A)(2)(b).
J-S55030-18


ineffective assistance. The PCRA court originally denied relief, but a three-

judge panel of this Court reversed, concluding that the defective waiver

colloquy was an issue of arguable merit.2 We remanded to the PCRA court for

an assessment of counsel’s strategy and the prejudice, if any, to Appellant.

The PCRA court once again denied relief, and this timely appeal followed.

       The prior panel quoted the underlying facts:

              [Appellant] and his brother and co-conspirator, Shamek
       Hynson [(Hynson)], had a powerful motive to kill the victim, Omar
       Reid [(the victim)], on October 18, 2004. The murder was an act
       of retaliation against [the victim] for an incident involving another
       one of their brothers—Ramek Neal—that took place nearly one
       year earlier. On November 5, 2003, at approximately 10:30 p.m.,
       Neal and another individual broke into [the victim’s] apartment at
       416 Victoria Drive, in the Regency Park complex located in
       Coatesville, Chester County, Pennsylvania. Neal brandished a
       pistol while demanding [the victim’s] property. [The victim]
       fought back and in self-defense shot Neal, leaving Neal paralyzed
       from the neck down. This November 2003 incident was the
       subject of subsequent family meetings attended by both
       [Appellant] and Hynson.

             On October 18, 2004, at approximately 11:00 p.m.,
       [Appellant] drove Hynson to [the victim’s] apartment at 416
       Victoria Drive in a Kia automobile that had been taken from a
       couple in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, to be used in the murder.
       Hynson got out of the Kia and knocked on [the victim]’s front door.
       As [the victim] opened the door, Hynson asked, “Are you Omar?”
       and then shot [the victim] six times. Shell casings were ejected
       from Hynson’s pistol and left at the murder scene. [The victim]
       collapsed and died on top of his five-year-old son, who had been
       on the living room floor near the front door. After the shooting,
       [Appellant] gestured to Hynson, from inside the Kia, to “hurry up.”
       This was observed by a witness looking out the window of her

____________________________________________


2 We affirmed the PCRA court’s denial of relief on Appellant’s remaining issues,
and our Supreme Court denied allowance of appeal. Direct appeal counsel’s
handling of the waiver colloquy is the sole remaining issue.

                                           -2-

     apartment. Hynson ran to the Kia, which was waiting for him with
     the front passenger’s door open. After Hynson got into the Kia,
     he closed the door, and [Appellant] sped away from the scene.

            A police officer happened to be driving into the Regency Park
     complex when a 911 dispatcher advised him of the shooting. The
     officer spotted the Kia and gave chase. During the chase, the
     murder weapon—a Hi-Point .380—was thrown from the car into
     the brush next to a railroad track. Due to the wet roadway,
     [Appellant] lost control and crashed the Kia into a ditch.
     [Appellant] and Hynson fled in different directions, and neither
     was apprehended by police at that time.

            Other individuals in [Appellant’s] Buick Riviera (another
     getaway vehicle) had been waiting, as planned, near the Regency
     Park complex and observed the police chasing the Kia to the
     location in Coatesville where [Appellant] had earlier switched from
     driving his own car, the Buick, and begun driving the Kia. They
     picked up Hynson, and Hynson told them that he had “just shot a
     man,” that he and [Appellant] were being chased, and that
     [Appellant] was still running from the police. Hynson and others
     then drove around Coatesville looking for [Appellant] and trying
     to find the gun that had been “tossed” during the getaway chase.
     Neither [Appellant] nor the gun was located, so they visited
     Ramek Neal to advise him of what happened and then returned to
     Lancaster. [Appellant] also made his way back to Lancaster.
     When he arrived, he was wet, he had a gash on his head, and his
     clothing was ripped. [Appellant] told his friends that, while being
     chased by the police, he had crashed the Kia and then had to run
     on foot.

           [Appellant’s] fingerprints were found on the interior driver’s
     door window of the crashed Kia. DNA testing confirmed the
     presence of Hynson’s blood on the interior passenger’s side of the
     Kia. Gunshot residue was also found inside the Kia. The murder
     weapon was found almost a year later by a woman walking her
     dog near the railroad tracks along [Appellant’s] escape route.
     That weapon was traced back to a straw purchase in North
     Carolina made by Tolanda Williams, the mother of Hynson’s child.
     Williams testified that during the week before the murder, she
     went with [Appellant] and Hynson to several pawn and gun shops
     in [Appellant’s] Buick, to be the straw purchaser of guns. The tag
     number of [Appellant’s] Buick was written down by one of the
     shop owners who became suspicious of one of the transactions.

J-S55030-18


       During cross-examination, the gun shop owner identified
       [Appellant] as the driver of the Buick. The Hi-Point .380 murder
       weapon was also used by Hynson to shoot Edward Cameron in
       Lancaster at approximately 4:30 p.m. on October 18, 2004—less
       than seven hours before [the victim] was murdered in Coatesville.
       Shell casings from the two shootings were all matched to the Hi-
       Point .380 found along the escape route. Cell phone records
       indicated that [Appellant’s] cell phone was active and used in the
       Coatesville area during and after the time of the murder.

Isaac, 2016 WL 5210891, at *1–2. At the conclusion of a six-day trial, the

jury found Appellant guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy. On July 8,

2009, the trial court sentenced Appellant to life in prison. This Court affirmed

the judgment of sentence on direct appeal, and our Supreme Court denied

allowance of appeal on August 12, 2012. Appellant filed this timely first PCRA

petition on November 12, 2013.3

       Presently, Appellant argues the PCRA court erred because counsel had

no reasonable strategic basis for failing to raise the inadequate waiver colloquy

on direct appeal, and because Appellant would have received a new trial had

counsel challenged the defective waiver colloquy. Appellant’s Brief at 4.

              In PCRA appeals, our scope of review is limited to the
       findings of the PCRA court and the evidence on the record of the
       PCRA court’s hearing, viewed in the light most favorable to the
       prevailing party. Because most PCRA appeals involve questions
       of fact and law, we employ a mixed standard of review. We defer
       to the PCRA court’s factual findings and credibility determinations
       supported by the record. In contrast, we review the PCRA court’s
       legal conclusions de novo.

Commonwealth v. Reyes-Rodriguez, 111 A.3d 775, 779 (Pa. Super. 2015)

(en banc). Counsel is presumed effective, and a PCRA petitioner asserting

otherwise bears the burden of proof.             Id. at 779-80.   Specifically, the

petitioner must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) the

underlying claim is of arguable merit; (2) counsel had no reasonable strategic

basis in support of the action or inaction; and (3) the petitioner suffered

prejudice, i.e., the outcome of the proceeding in question would have been

different but for counsel’s error. Id. at 780. A petitioner’s failure to prove

any one of these three prongs is fatal to the claim. Id.

       The right to counsel is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the

United States Constitution and Article V, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania

Constitution.    Commonwealth v. Clyburn, 42 A.3d 296, 298 (Pa. Super.

2012).4 When a defendant wishes to waive the right to counsel, the trial court

is “ultimately responsible for ensuring that the defendant is questioned about

the six areas [specified in Rule 121] and for determining whether the

defendant is indeed making an informed and independent decision to waive

counsel.”     Commonwealth v. Davido, 868 A.2d 431, 437 (Pa. 2005)

4 This Court decided Clyburn two days before our affirmance of Appellant’s

counsel when she filed her Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b). Nonetheless, Clyburn relied
on precedents.

court to fully advise the accused [of the nature and elements of the crime]

before accepting waiver of counsel.”    Clyburn, 42 A.3d at 299 (quoting

Commonwealth ex rel. Clinger v. Russell, 213 A.2d 100, 102 (Pa. Super.

1965)) (brackets added in Clyburn).       A “penetrating and comprehensive

colloquy” is mandatory, regardless of the defendant’s experience with the

system. Id. at 300 (quoting Commonwealth v. Owens, 750 A.2d 872, 876

(Pa. Super. 2000)). “Failure to conduct a thorough, on-the-record colloquy

before allowing a defendant to proceed to trial pro se constitutes reversible

error” on direct appeal. Id.

     A defendant also has a constitutional right to self-representation.

Clyburn, 42 A.3d at 298; United States v. Isaac, 655 F.3d 148, 153 (3d

Cir. 2011), cert. denied, 566 U.S. 1029 (2012).      This right prevents the

Commonwealth from bringing a defendant into court and forcing a lawyer on

him. Commonwealth v. Starr, 664 A.2d 1326, 1334-35 (1995). In other

words, the right to counsel is intended as “an aid to a wiling defendant—not

an organ of the State interposed between an unwilling defendant and his right

to defend himself personally.” Commonwealth v. Tejada, 188 A.3d 1288,

1295 (Pa. Super. 2018) (quoting Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 820

(1975)).

     We now turn to the facts of this case. The remand record reveals that

Appellant was uncooperative during two separate waiver colloquies. At the

first one, on September 18, 2008, Appellant repeatedly refused to answer the


                                    -6-
J-S55030-18


trial court’s colloquy questions because he believed the court lacked

jurisdiction over him.     N.T. Hearing, 9/18/2008, at 15-22.         Appellant’s

uncooperative behavior led the trial court to have him gagged. Id. at 27.

Eventually, the gag was removed and the trial court attempted a colloquy.

Appellant stated that he did not know the elements of criminal homicide, and

that he was unable to list the elements of the charged offenses. Id. at 43,

56. The trial court did not explain the elements to Appellant. Ultimately, the

court denied Appellant’s request to represent himself based on Appellant’s

insufficient understanding of the law. Id. at 59-62.

      At the second hearing, on October 2, 2008, Appellant repeatedly

referred to an “affidavit of specific negative averment” that he apparently

attempted to file and serve on the trial court, among others. N.T. Hearing,

10/2/2008, at 6-8.       Appellant apparently believed that the trial court’s

“default” in failing to respond to his affidavit rendered the criminal proceedings

against him invalid. Id. at 10. Despite Appellant’s failure to cooperate with

a waiver colloquy the trial court granted Appellant’s request to represent

himself. Id. at 29. The court noted that Appellant’s stated, at the September

18, 2008 hearing, that he did not understand the elements of the charged

offenses. Id. at 31. Even so, the court did not describe the elements of the

charged offenses to Appellant.

      At the May 5, 2017 PCRA hearing ordered by the previous panel of this

Court, direct appellate counsel, Brenda Jones, testified that her appointment


                                      -7-
J-S55030-18


began in 2007. N.T. Hearing, 5/2/17, at 10. Another appointed attorney was

first chair, and Jones was to serve as death penalty counsel.      Id.    Jones

remembered the waiver colloquies as contentious. Id. at 12. Jones testified

that Appellant was adamant about his decision to represent himself:

            [THE COURT:]        On the basis of your knowledge of
      [Appellant] and at the time of the second hearing, on his waiver
      of counsel, do you believe that if I as the trial judge had
      specifically outlined each and every element of each and every
      charge against him, that he would have under those
      circumstances changed his mind about wanting to represent
      himself?

            [JONES]: Your Honor, no. I always thought that he wanted
      to represent himself, Judge. I never thought—I would say, this is
      my opinion, that it wouldn’t have made any difference.

            THE COURT: Okay. When you were observing him during
      the course of the, at least the second hearing on self-
      representation, when combined with the first hearing on self-
      representation, how adamant was he on a scale of one to ten, ten
      being the highest and most adamant, about representing himself?

             [JONES]: Your Honor, I would say he was a ten.

Id. at 20.

      Procedurally, Jones was appointed to represent Appellant after he filed

a pro se notice of appeal and a pro se Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement. Id. at

18.   Jones filed a motion for an extension of time to file a supplemental

statement, pending completion of transcripts. Id. The trial court granted one

such motion, but did not grant a second extension while Jones was still

awaiting several transcripts, including the waiver colloquy transcripts. Id. at

18, 25, 28. In any event, Jones testified that she recalled from her presence

at the September 18 and October 2, 2007 hearings that Appellant was not

                                     -8-
J-S55030-18


aware of the elements of the charged offenses. Id. at 30. On appeal, Jones

challenged Appellant’s competency to represent himself, rather than the

validity of the colloquy. Id. at 32-33. She believed his nonresponsive answers

to the trial court’s questions and his concern with matters irrelevant to his

defense called his competency into question. Id. at 33. This Court found the

competency issue waived for lack of an objection at trial. Commonwealth

v. Isaac, 46 A.3d 830 (Pa. Super. 2012) (unpublished memorandum, at 10);

appeal denied, 50 A.3d 125 (Pa. 2012). We also noted that Appellant did

not specifically challenge the validity of the waiver colloquy.      Id.   For this

reason, the previous collateral review panel of this Court concluded Appellant

has not previously litigated the issue before us.          See Isaac, 2016 WL

5210891, unpublished memorandum at *3-4.

        The PCRA court found that the record was unclear as to counsel’s

strategic basis for not challenging the waiver colloquy.5 The PCRA court found

Appellant’s failure to prove prejudice dispositive. PCRA Opinion, 12/21/2017,

at 3.   Ultimately, we agree.        Therefore, we will focus our analysis on this

element.

        In Commonwealth v. Pou, ___ A.3d ____, 2018 WL 4925254 (Pa.

Super. October 11, 2018), this Court considered circumstances similar to the

5 The PCRA court did not make any finding on counsel’s strategy, noting only
that “[t]he testimony offered by appellate counsel at the hearing of May 2,
2017 did not conclusively answer this question.       PCRA Court Opinion,
12/21/17, at 3.

instant case—the appellant waived his right to counsel at trial after a defective

colloquy and appointed direct appeal counsel failed to raise the issue. In Pou,

the trial court failed to apprise the appellant of the applicable statutory

maximum sentences or inquire into his age, educational background, and

ability to comprehend the proceedings. Id. at *1-2. There, as here, a panel

of this Court found the issue to be of arguable merit and remanded for further

proceedings after the PCRA court denied relief without a hearing. Id. *2. On

remand, the PCRA court found that counsel had a reasonable strategic basis

for choosing not to raise the issue, but this Court rejected that argument on

appeal. Id. at *3. Instead, we concluded the petitioner failed to demonstrate

prejudice even though the petitioner would have received a new trial had

counsel challenged the Rule 121 colloquy on direct appeal. Id. at *4. “The

failure to raise that claim was doubtlessly prejudicial, but as we shall explain

it does not rise to the level of Pierce prejudice.” Id. The reference is to

Commonwealth v. Pierce, 527 A.2d 973 (Pa. 1987), wherein the

Pennsylvania    Supreme    Court    articulated   the   three-prong   ineffective

assistance of counsel analysis, in accord with the United States Supreme

Court’s opinion in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). As set

forth above, a PCRA petitioner must normally plead and prove that counsel’s

error was prejudicial within the meaning of Pierce. In limited circumstances,

pursuant to United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648 (1984), prejudice can be

presumed on collateral review.

J-S55030-18


      The Pou Court relied on Weaver v. Massachusetts, 137 S.Ct. 1899

(2017), in which the United States Supreme Court explained that an error that

would invalidate a conviction on direct appeal need not necessarily do so on

collateral review. In Weaver, the defendant argued that trial counsel was

ineffective for failing to object to the trial court’s order closing the courtroom

to the public. Id. at 1905-06. Had counsel raised the issue on direct appeal,

the defendant would have received a new trial.        Id.   On collateral review,

however, the Weaver Court held that the petitioner failed to demonstrate

prejudice:

             As explained above, not every public-trial violation will in
      fact lead to a fundamentally unfair trial. Nor can it be said that
      the failure to object to a public-trial violation always deprives the
      defendant of a reasonable probability of a different outcome.
      Thus, when a defendant raises a public-trial violation via an
      ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, Strickland prejudice is
      not shown automatically. Instead, the burden is on the defendant
      to show either a reasonable probability of a different outcome in
      his or her case or, as the Court has assumed for these purposes,
      […] to show that the particular public-trial violation was so serious
      as to render his or her trial fundamentally unfair.

Id. at 1911 (internal citations omitted).

      Consistent with Weaver, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has held on

several occasions that the absence of harmless error for purposes of direct

appeal does not equate to presumed prejudice on collateral review.             In

Commonwealth v. Reaves, 923 A.2d 1119 (Pa. 2007), the trial court failed

to comply with Rule 708(C)(2) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, which

requires the trial court to state on the record its reasons for the sentence it



                                     - 11 -
J-S55030-18


imposes after a violation of probation (“VOP”).    Id. at 1129; Pa.R.Crim.P.

708(C)(2). The Supreme Court noted that, “in a direct review context, Rule

708 operates in a fashion which is not unlike Cronic; prejudice (or rather the

absence of harmless error) will be presumed from the failure to comply.” Id.

at 1129-30.

           Once a Rule 708 procedural complaint has been waived,
     however, and a derivative claim is raised under the guise of
     ineffective assistance of counsel, there is no reason to presume
     Sixth Amendment, Strickland prejudice from the VOP court’s
     unobjected-to failure to comply with Rule 708. Derivative claims
     of ineffective assistance of counsel are analytically distinct from
     the defaulted direct review claims that were (or could have been)
     raised on direct appeal. Commonwealth v. Collins, 585 Pa. 45,
     888 A.2d 564, 572–73 (2005). As noted, Strickland requires a
     showing of actual prejudice, not the presumed prejudice arising
     from Cronic, nor the harmless error standard that governs
     ordinary claims of trial court error on direct review, nor the
     presumption of harm arising on direct review of Rule 708 claims.
     This Court has long recognized the distinction between Strickland
     prejudice and the harmless error standard applicable in the direct
     review context, and this distinction can be outcome-
     determinative.

Id. at 1130.

     Likewise, in Commonwealth v. Mallory, 941 A.2d 686 (Pa. 2008),

cert. denied, 555 U.S. 884 (2008), our Supreme Court refused to presume

prejudice where the trial court failed to conduct an oral colloquy before

permitting the defendants to waive their right to a jury trial pursuant to

Pa.R.Crim.P. 620. The Mallory Court also explained the distinction between

a waiver colloquy and the underlying right. “A waiver colloquy is a procedural




                                    - 12 -
J-S55030-18


device; it is not a constitutional end or a constitutional ‘right.’” Id. at 697.

Further,

             “[A]n on-the-record colloquy is a useful procedural tool
       whenever the waiver of any significant right is at issue,
       constitutional or otherwise, e.g. waiver of a trial, waiver of the
       right to counsel, waiver of the right to call witnesses, waiver of
       the right to cross-examine witnesses, waiver of rules-based
       speedy trial time limits, etc. But the colloquy does not share
       the same status as the right itself.

Id. (emphasis added).

       The Supreme Court reasoned that a constitutional, structural error

creating presumed prejudice under Cronic would have occurred if, for

example, a timely jury trial demand was wrongly denied.            Id. at 697.

Counsel’s effectiveness during a waiver colloquy, on the other hand, is “far

removed” from a structural constitutional error.    Id.   On collateral review,

therefore, when the issue is counsel’s effectiveness, a “presumptively-valid

waiver […] must be analyzed like any other ineffectiveness claim.” Id. at 698.

That is, the prejudice analysis must encompass the “totality of relevant

circumstances.” Id. In the context of a jury trial waiver, those circumstances

could include “the defendant’s knowledge of and experience with jury trials,

his explicit written waiver (if any), and the content of relevant off-the-record

instructions counsel had with his client.” Id. The defendant must show that

his understanding of the jury waiver was impaired by counsel’s performance,

and that he would have elected a jury but for counsel’s performance. Id. at

702.



                                     - 13 -
J-S55030-18


      Later, in Commonwealth v. Spotz, 18 A.3d 244 (Pa. 2011), the PCRA

petitioner challenged counsel’s failure to object to a defective waiver of

counsel colloquy. The Supreme Court held that, “[t]o establish prejudice, the

petitioner must demonstrate a reasonable probability that but for counsel’s

ineffectiveness, he would not have waived the right at issue.” Id. at 263-64.

      We now turn back to Pou, which, like the instant matter, concerned

appellate counsel’s failure to raise a defective waiver colloquy on direct appeal.

We acknowledged there was “no doubt” the petitioner would have received a

new trial had counsel raised the issue on direct appeal. Id. at *6. Consistent

with Weaver and our State Supreme Court precedents, however, we

concluded the technical deficiency under Rule 121 was not sufficient, in and

of itself, to establish prejudice on collateral review. Id. at 7-8. That is, the

trial court’s failure to comply with the technicalities of a rule does not amount

to a structural error warranting presumed prejudice. Id. The United States

Constitution requires that a defendant “be made aware of the dangers and

disadvantages of self-representation, so that the record will establish that ‘he

knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open.’” Id. at *9

(quoting Faretta, 422 U.S. at 835). Therefore, “Rule 121 goes farther than

what the United States Constitution requires” and “a technically-deficient




                                     - 14 -
J-S55030-18


waiver of counsel colloquy is not the same as a constitutionally deficient

waiver of counsel.” Id.6

       Instantly, Appellant relies on case law governing direct review. Without

expressly acknowledging it, he presents this case as one involving structural

error and presumed prejudice pursuant to Cronic. Specifically, Appellant’s

reliance on Clyburn is misplaced. There, the trial court failed to inform the

defendant of the charges against him and the elements of each of those

charges.     Clyburn, 42 A.3d at 301.              This Court therefore found itself

“constrained” to hold that the defendant’s waiver of counsel was invalid, and

that “the failure to explain the elements of the charged crimes requires us to

vacate the judgment of sentence.” Id. (citing Commonwealth v. Houtz,

856 A.2d 119, 130 (Pa. Super. 2004)). As Clyburn was decided on direct

appeal, it is inapposite.

       As was the case in Pou, Appellant fails to distinguish between a

technically deficient waiver colloquy and a constitutionally deficient waiver



____________________________________________


6  We observe that, in Commonwealth v. Meehan, 628 A.2d 1151 (Pa.
Super. 1993), appeal denied, 649 A.2d 670 (Pa. 1994), this Court held that,
on collateral review, the PCRA court need not conduct a full colloquy before
permitting the petitioner to waive counsel, as several of the mandatory
inquiries are inapplicable on collateral review (Meehan was decided under
Rule 318, the predecessor to current Rule 121). The Meehan Court noted
the petitioner’s failure to assert “that he would not have waived his right to
counsel if more specific inquiry had been made into the relevant areas.” Id.
at 1159. Meehan is not directly applicable here because it governs a
petitioner’s statutory right to counsel on collateral review.


                                          - 15 -
J-S55030-18


colloquy, and he does not argue that the instant case presents an example of

the latter.

       The deprivation of the colloquy, as we have already explained, does not

share the same status as the deprivation of the right itself. Mallory, 941 A.2d

at 697. Under Mallory, a structural error would have occurred here if, for

example, Appellant demanded and was refused counsel. In fact, Appellant

had two appointed lawyers representing him when he insisted on his right to

self-representation and failed to cooperate with the trial court’s Rule 121

colloquy.7


____________________________________________


7   Regarding Appellant’s behavior at the colloquies, the PCRA court cited
Commonwealth v. Bastone, 467 A.2d 1339 (Pa. Super. 1983), in which the
defendant was unrepresented by counsel at his preliminary hearing. This
Court considered former Rule 318(b), which required a knowing, intelligent,
and voluntary waiver before a defendant proceed without counsel at a
preliminary hearing. The trial court attempted to conduct a waiver colloquy,
but the defendant refused to answer questions, refused to sign a written
colloquy, and eventually turned his back to the judge. This Court wrote:

              We believe that appellant’s contemptuous behavior
       constituted a knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of counsel.
       To require a written waiver in a case such as this could create a
       ‘Catch-22’ situation in that a ‘court-wise’ criminal defendant could
       continually appear in court without counsel on the date scheduled
       for his trial but refuse to execute a written waiver of his right to
       counsel making it impossible to proceed with his trial. Obviously,
       such a situation would render the judicial system a mockery.

Id. at 1341. Further, this Court found that any error was harmless because
the defendant failed to explain how he was prejudiced by the absence of
counsel at a preliminary hearing. Id.




                                          - 16 -

       In light of the foregoing, we conclude Appellant is not entitled to relief.

       Order affirmed.

____________________________________________


      The “Catch-22” problem does not arise here because Appellant had
appointed counsel. Further, given Appellant’s failure to attempt to prove
prejudice in accord with the cases discussed in the main text, we need not
decide whether Bastone, decided under Rule 318, applies with equal force to
Rule 121. Likewise, we need not consider the Commonwealth’s assertion that
Appellant’s behavior resulted in forfeiture of his right to counsel.

THE MISSISSIPPI BAR
v.
Jimmy D. McGUIRE.
No. 94-BD-00520-SCT.
Supreme Court of Mississippi.
May 15, 1997.

ORDER
This matter is before the Court upon the Motion for Indefinite Suspension Pending Appeal filed by the Mississippi Bar. The complaint involves McGuire's conviction of the crime of filing a false currency reporting form in violation of 26 U.S.C.A. §§ 6050I(f)(1)(B), 7206(1). This Court entered its order on December 15, 1994, granting the Bar's request for indefinite suspension pending appeal.
On January 21, 1997, the Bar provided certification that the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the District Court, which affirmed McGuire's conviction, and issued the mandate on October 31, 1996. This Court finds that McGuire has been adjudicated guilty of the offense of filing false currency reporting forms, a felony, and that pursuant to Rule 6, Rules of Discipline, he should be disbarred.
IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED as follows:
1. Jimmy D. McGuire be, and hereby is, DISBARRED from the practice of law.
2. This order shall constitute notice of disbarment in this cause.
3. The Clerk of the Supreme Court of Mississippi shall immediately forward an attested copy of this Order to the Circuit Court Judges and Chancellors in and for Harrison County, Mississippi, and the Senior Judges of each court shall enter this order upon the minutes of their respective courts.
4. The Clerk of the Supreme Court of Mississippi shall immediately forward an attested copy of this Order to the Clerks of the United States District Courts in and for Mississippi, to the Clerk of the United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and to the Clerk of the Supreme Court.
5. Costs of the formal complaint should be, and hereby are, assessed against Jimmy D. McGuire.

                 THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
          EASTERN DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY, NORTHERN DIVISION
                   COVINGTON, CIVIL NO. 14-119-ART


HONORABLE STEPHEN D. WOLNITZEK,
IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS CHAIR,
JUDICIAL CONDUCT COMMISSION, ET AL.




              OPINION OF THE COURT BY JUSTICE VENTERS

                            CERTIFYING THE LAW

      Pursuant to CR 76.37(1), we granted the certification request of the

United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky (District

Court), to provide the answer under Kentucky law to the following three

questions and the associated sub-questions:

Question 1:

      Canon 5A(1)(a) states that a judge or judicial candidate shall not
      "campaign as a member of a political organization." What
      constitutes "campaign[ing] as a member of a political
       organization"? As applied to this case, would it include a
       candidate's statements in mailers identifying his political party,
       such as "I am the only Republican candidate for Judge" or "I am
       the Conservative Republican candidate for Judge"? Would a
       candidate's statement that his opponent was "the Democrat
       candidate for Judge" or the "Liberal Democrat for Judge" violate
       the Canon?

Question 2:

      Canon 5A(1)(b) states that a judge or judicial candidate shall not
      "act as a leader or hold any office in a political organization." What
      constitutes "act[ing] as a leader or hold[ing] any office"? As applied
      to this case, would hosting events for a political party violate the
      Canon?

Question 3:

      Canon 5B(1)(c) states that a judge or judicial candidate "shall not
      knowingly, or with reckless disregard for the truth, misrepresent
      any candidate's identity, qualifications, present position, or make
      any other false or misleading statements." What constitutes a false
      statement? As applied to this case, would it include a candidate
      who asks voters to "re-elect" her to a second term even though she
      was appointed to her first term?

      These canons were promulgated by this Court with the objective of

complying with Section 117 of our Constitution requiring that "Justices of the

Supreme Court and judges of the Court of Appeals, Circuit and District Court

shall be elected from their respective districts or circuits on a nonpartisan basis

as provided by law." (Emphasis added.) We interpret this provision of the

Kentucky Constitution as directing that Kentucky's judicial elections be

nonpartisan in truth and substance, and not merely in process and procedure

by the superficial omission of a political party designation on the voting ballot.

Accordingly, we provide the following certification of Kentucky law in response

to the District Court's questions.


                                         2
                 I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
       Robert A. Winter, Jr., filed to run in the May 2014 primary election as a

candidate for circuit court judge in the 16th Judicial Circuit (Campbell

County). As part of his campaign strategy, Winter mailed brochures to

registered Republican voters identifying himself as a registered Republican

and, conversely, identifying his opponents as registered Democrats. After the

brochures were sent out, the Kentucky Judicial Conduct Commission (JCC)

notified Winter that it had received complaints that his brochures violated the

Kentucky Code of Judicial Conduct. Winter responded in June 2014 by filing

suit in the District Court against the JCC challenging the constitutionality of

Canons 5A(1)(a) (prohibiting judges and judicial candidates from campaigning

as a member of a political organization) and 5B(1)(c) (prohibiting judges or

judicial candidates from making "false" or "misleading" statements).

      During the same election cycle, Cameron Blau entered the race as a

candidate for district court judge in the 17th Judicial District (Campbell

County). Because Blau likewise intended to openly campaign as a Republican

and send brochures likewise identifying himself as a Republican, in October

2014, Blau filed an intervening complaint to join Winter's challenge to Canons

5A(1)(a) and 5B(1)(c). As relevant here, Blau also challenged the

constitutionality of Canon 5A(1)(b) (a judicial candidate shall not "act as a

leader or hold any office in a political organization"). In his complaint, Blau

stated that he wanted to send out brochures to potential voters identifying

himself as "the only Republican candidate for Judge," or "the Conservative


                                         3
Republican candidate for Judge" and identifying his opponent as "the

Democrat candidate" or the "Liberal Democrat for Judge." Blau also indicated

in his complaint that he wanted to seek the endorsement of the local

Republican Party, host events for the local Republican Party, and make

political donations to members of the Republican Party.' In a lengthy order

preliminarily addressing the constitutionality of the canons under review (the

Injunction Order), the District Court concluded that there was a likelihood that

each of the canons at issue was unconstitutional, and granted Blau's motion to

prevent the JCC from enforcing the canons against him in the November 2014

election.

       Allison Jones was appointed by Governor Steve Beshear to the Kentucky

Court of Appeals in July 2013. To retain the office to which she was appointed,

Jones became a candidate in the November 2014 General Election. In October

2014, the JCC received a complaint alleging that Judge Jones had made false

and misleading statements in speeches and campaign materials. The "false

and misleading statements" referred to Jones' use of the word "re-elect" to

describe her effort to retain the judicial position to which she had been

appointed rather than "elected." Jones then intervened in Winter's District

Court action, contending that Canon 5B(1)(c) (prohibiting false statements) was

unconstitutional. The only issue presented in Jones' portion of the case is

whether an incumbent judge who was appointed to office may properly use the



        1 Blau also raised constitutional challenges to other judicial canons not at issue
in the questions of law presently before us.

                                            4
word "re-elect" to describe her effort to retain the office to which she was

appointed but not elected.

       It is within the context of this litigation that the District Court requested

that we certify the law on the questions addressed herein.


                          II. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
       We begin with a few general considerations that guide our examination of

the questions presented by the District Court. First, pursuant to the Kentucky

Constitution, all judges and justices at every level of the state judiciary are

selected by ballots cast by the people of Kentucky. Ky. Const. § 117. Thus, we

recognize that the judicial canons we address in this decision were designed to

serve the state's compelling interest of encouraging an unbiased and impartial

judiciary for the Commonwealth, and that the Commonwealth's interest is

offset by restricting the political speech of only the few who volunteer to be a

candidate for office, not their supporters, advocates, and non-candidate

adversaries.

      The ultimate objective of our system of judicial selection is to achieve a

delicate balance. On one side of the scales, we must foster and protect the

people's prerogative to choose by direct vote the judges that preside locally and

statewide. On the other side of the scales, we must create a political

environment in which judges selected by the citizens are not tethered, or

beholden to partisan political factions and their associated creeds. And, we

must do so in a way that preserves the judiciary as an institution that is not

partial to or biased against any political faction.

                                          5
        The federal judicial system achieves this balance by an effective but

different approach. Rather than selecting judges by popular election, the

federal system selects judges by the collaborative effort of the political

branches, the executive and the legislative, based upon any and all factors

including the nominee's political ties, beliefs, and political ideologies. The

federal system achieves its assurance that judges are not beholden to political

interests and factions by appointing them for life. With the lifetime tenure,

federal judges are liberated from any ties or allegiance to the political factions

that supported their ascension, and that might otherwise seek to influence

them.

        The federal system secures the government's vital interest in an

independent judiciary at the expense of the people's ability to choose and

replace their judges. Kentuckians, like the citizens of most states, chose to

achieve the same balance by alternate means. We have judges who must earn

the public's respect and maintain the public's confidence by periodically

entering and re-entering the arena of elective politics. Kentucky, like most

states, assures the impartiality and integrity of the judiciary, not with a lifetime

appointment, but through moderate restrictions on partisan activities set out

in canons of conduct. The judicial canons at issue in this case perform the

same function of keeping judges free from the potentially corruptive influences

and appearances of partisan politics accomplished in the federal system by the

lifetime tenure of judges. As such, the canons that make up our Code Judicial




                                         6
Conduct advance a laudable and necessary goal that serves a vital interest of

this Commonwealth.

       In the discussions of the judicial canons at hand, we are mindful that the

public's trust in, and respect for, its judiciary is at stake. We accordingly are

constrained to undertake a narrow view of those canons as we answer the

questions posed by the District Court. At the same time we provide an

interpretation that complies with controlling First Amendment case authorities,

strict scrutiny, and other relevant, constitutional principles relating to

vagueness, overinclusiveness, and underinclusiveness.


                        III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
      Our canons of judicial conduct are set forth in Supreme Court Rule

(SCR) 4.300. The preamble to the canons states in part:

      The Code of Judicial Conduct is intended to establish standards
      for ethical conduct of judges. It [of necessity] consists of broad
      statements . . . .



      The Canons and Sections are rules of reason. They should be
      applied consistent with constitutional requirements, statutes,
      other court rules and decisional law and in the context of all
      relevant circumstances . . . .

      This litigation concerns the restrictions on the speech of judicial

candidates in judicial elections. Because the First Amendment 2 reviles




       2 The First Amendment provides that Congress "shall make no law . . .
abridging the freedom of speech." The Fourteenth Amendment makes that prohibition
applicable to the States. Stromberg v. California, 283 U.S. 359, 368 (1931).

                                         7
 restrictions on core political speech, 3 such restrictions are subject to the strict

 scrutiny standard. Williams-Yulee v. Florida Bar, 135 S. Ct. 1656, 1665

 (2015). 4 Under the strict scrutiny standard, "[a] State may restrict the speech

of a judicial candidate only if the restriction is narrowly tailored to serve a

compelling interest." Id. Prior authorities have identified and held that there is

a compelling governmental interest in encouraging an unbiased and impartial

judiciary and in maintaining the integrity of the judiciary.        See id. at 1666

(States have a compelling interest in preserving public confidence in the

integrity of the judiciary). Those are precisely the interests addressed in the

canons under review.

       We interpret the law, including the judicial canons now under review, by

applying the plain and ordinary meaning of relevant text.          Pearce v. University

of Louisville, by & through its Board of Trustees, 448 S.W.3d 746, 749 (Ky.

2014). 5 We fundamentally undertake to construe the law so as to avoid an

unconstitutional result. Caneyville Volunteer Fire Department v. Green's

Motorcycle Salvage, Inc., 286 S.W.3d 790, 806 (Ky. 2009); Ballinger v.



       3 Speech concerning public issues and the qualifications of candidates for
elective office commands the highest level of First Amendment protection. See Eu v.
San Francisco County Democratic Central Committee., 489 U.S. 214, 223 (1989).
       4 This holding appears in Section II of Williams-Yulee, which was joined by only
four Justices. However, the four dissenters likewise agree that strict scrutiny is the
proper standard of review of laws constraining judicial campaign speech. Accordingly,
it is now definitively established that strict scrutiny is the proper standard of review in
judicial electioneering cases.
        5 Of course, there is an obvious difference between our interpretation of
legislative acts, in which our principal objective is to determine the intent of another
body; here, the judicial canons we interpret were promulgated by this Court, and thus
in this sense we are interpreting our own work.

                                             8
 Commonwealth, 459 S.W.3d 349, 354 (Ky. 2015) (citations omitted). Of course

this fundamental rule of construction also applies to the interpretation of the

rules we promulgate. Summe v. Judicial Retirement and Removal Commission,

947(S.W.2d 42, 47 (Ky. 1997). Moreover, we accede to the decisions of the

federal courts addressing important First Amendment issues relating to judicial

candidate electioneering. Because recent federal decisions guide our

interpretation of the canons at issue, we begin with a brief overview of their

central holdings.

       In Republican Party of Minnesota v. White, 536 U.S. 765 (2002), the

Supreme Court struck down a Minnesota judicial canon which prohibited

candidates for judicial election from announcing their views on disputed legal

or political issues. Proponents of the canon argued that it survived the strict

scrutiny test because it served the compelling governmental interest of

preserving the appearance of an impartial judiciary. The Court, however,

concluded that the canon failed the strict scrutiny test because it did not

advance the proffered interest. The Court held that the canon did not preserve

the appearance of an impartial judiciary because it did not restrict speech

advocating for or against particular parties or political factions; rather, it

restricted candidates from expressing their own personal opinions on popular

issues. The Court found no compelling state interest in suppressing judicial

candidates' views on such issues. 6



       6 See also J.C.J.D. v. R.J.C.R., 803 S.W.2d 953 (Ky. 1991) (Panel of Special
Justices) (Code of Judicial Conduct provision prohibiting all discussion of judicial
                                            9
       In Family Trust Foundation of Kentucky v. Wolnitzek,        345 F. Supp. 2d 672

(E.D. Ky. 2004), the District Court considered Kentucky's Judicial Canon

5B(1)(c), which provided, in relevant part, that a judge or candidate to judicial

office "shall not make pledges or promises of conduct in office other than the

faithful and impartial performance of the duties of the office; [and] shall not

make statements that commit or appear to commit the candidate with respect

to cases, controversies or issues that are likely to come before the court[.]" In

striking down the canon, the District Court held that the canon was

unconstitutionally overbroad in that it was not limited to a ban on promises or

commitments by candidates to rule a certain way on cases likely to come before

them (which would be sustainable as furthering a compelling government

interest in securing judicial open mindedness), and it consequently stifled the

right of judges and candidates to speak out on issues and the corresponding

right of voters to hear their views. Consistent with that determination the

decision further held that judicial candidates cannot be prohibited from

responding to election issue questionnaires inquiring into their positions on

public issues.

       In Carey v. Wolnitzek, 614 F.3d 189 (6th Cir. 2010), the Sixth Circuit

Court of Appeals held that a former version of Kentucky Judicial Canon 5A(2),

which prohibited judges and judicial candidates from disclosing their party


candidate's views on disputed legal or political issues unnecessarily violated
constitutional free speech rights of judicial candidates).




                                           10
affiliation in any form of advertising, or when speaking to a gathering, except in

answer to a direct question by a voter in one-on-one or very small private

informal settings, was unconstitutional because it was not narrowly tailored to

advance the Commonwealth's interest in preventing a biased judiciary, or

diminishing the role of political parties in judicial selection, and thus the canon

facially violated free speech and associational rights. The Sixth Circuit

reasoned that by prohibiting candidates from disclosing their party affiliations,

the clause effectively prevented candidates from announcing their individual

views on many issues to the extent that a party identification signals the

judicial candidate's alignment with the views incorporated into a political

party's platform. The decision further held that the canon was underinclusive

for these additional reasons: the identification of the candidate's party

affiliation was forbidden only when the candidate raised the point and could

otherwise be disclosed by the candidate's supporters; judicial candidates were

not restrained from disclosing their memberships or affiliations with other

types of organizations that advocated political opinions, such as the Federalist

Society or the ACLU, which may be more telling than one's actual party

identification itself; and the canon did not prohibit judicial candidates from

being members of a political party. Rather, it only prohibited them from

announcing their particular party membership.?



        7 Carey also held that our canon prohibiting a judicial candidate from
personally soliciting funds was unconstitutional; however, that holding has been
superseded by Williams-Yulee v. Florida Bar, 135 S. Ct. 1656 (2015) (upholding
restrictions on a judicial candidate's personal solicitation of campaign funds).

                                          11
       Most recently, and perhaps most importantly, the Supreme Court

decided in Williams-Yulee that a Florida judicial canon restricting a judicial

candidate's personal solicitation of campaign funds was constitutional because

it was narrowly tailored to serve the compelling governmental interest in

obviating the indecorous practice of an attorney who regularly practiced before

a judge, or a litigant with a case pending before a judge, personally handing

cash to the judge or being placed in the untenable position of rebuffing the

judge's personal solicitation. See also Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., Inc.,

556 U.S. 868, 889 (2009) (holding that there is serious risk of actual bias,

based on objective and reasonable perceptions, when a person with a personal

stake in a particular case has significant and disproportionate influence in

placing a judge on the case by raising funds, or by directing a judge's election

campaign, when the case was pending or imminent).

      With the above standards and constitutional limitations in mind, we now

turn to the particular questions posed by the District Court in its certification

of law request.


                        IV. QUESTION I - CANON 5A(1)(A)

      The District Court's first question seeks certification of a broadly-stated

question along with two more specific subparts. Canon 5A(1)(a) states as

follows:

      Canon 5. A judge or judicial candidate shall refrain from
      inappropriate political activity.

      A. Political Conduct in General.


                                         12
       (1) Except as permitted by law, a judge or a candidate for election
       to judicial office shall not:

       (a) campaign as a member of a political organization[.]


(Emphasis added.) The section is further clarified by the following official

commentary:

      A judge or a candidate for election to judicial office retains the right
      to participate in the political process as a voter. A judge or a
      candidate for election to judicial office may publicly affiliate with a
      political organization but may not campaign as a member of a
      political organization.

      Because the specific prohibition contained in Canon 5A(1)(a) (shall not . .

. campaign as a member of a political organization) is limited by the

introductory clause "except as permitted by law," our interpretation of the

section is guided by the various First Amendment court decisions addressing

judicial campaign issues as referenced above.

   A. Answer to Question 1: What constitutes "campaign[ing] as a
      member of a political organization"?

      The Terminology Section of SCR 4.300 defines a "political organization"

as "denot[ing] a political party or other group, the principal purpose of which is

to further the election or appointment of candidates to political office." The

Democrat and Republican parties clearly fall within this definition.    Carey held

that a judicial candidate cannot be restrained from identifying himself as a

member of a political party, and our current version of Canon 5 was

promulgated in response to that decision. It follows that the canon does not,

and indeed could not, reach that activity. In summary, a judicial candidate

may identify himself to the public as a member of a political party.    Carey v.

                                        13
Wolnitzek, 614 F.3d 189; Commentary to Canon 5 ("a candidate for election to

judicial office may publicly affiliate with a political organization").

       Nevertheless, there is a vast difference between the permissible speech of

a judicial candidate identifying herself as a member of a political party and the

impermissibly deceptive conduct of representing herself as the nominee of a

political party. The former statement would be true; the latter is by any

standard, blatantly false. Canon 5A(1)(a) draws that distinction.

      The Canon 5 provision proscribing "campaigning as a member of a

political organization" prohibits the dissemination of campaign materials and

other public representations suggesting to the voters that the candidate is the

endorsed judicial nominee of a political party. For example, a campaign

representation such as "I am the Republican candidate for the 16th Judicial

Circuit Court" is impermissible. There is no "Republican candidate" for that

office; the assertion is materially false and misleading.   See Canon 5B(1)(c)

(prohibiting materially false statements). Political parties and factions do not

select or nominate candidates for judicial office in Kentucky. Canon 5A(1)(a)

merely recognizes and faithfully codifies this Constitutional reality.

   B. Answer to Question 1A: As applied to this case, would it include a
      candidate's statements in mailers identifying his political party,
      such as "I am the only Republican candidate for Judge" or "I am the
      Conservative Republican candidate for Judge"?
      As noted above, pursuant to Carey, prohibiting a judicial candidate from

identifying himself as a member of a political party is unconstitutional and the

present version of Canon 5A(1)(a) was drawn to comply with Carey. Therefore,

the statement "I am the only Republican candidate for Judge" is permissible, as

                                          14
long as it is true, because the message merely identifies the candidate as a

Republican who is a candidate for judge, albeit the only one. It does not imply

that the candidate is the nominee of the Republican Party, which would be

prohibited.

      In contrast, the statement "I am the Conservative Republican candidate

for Judge," transmits the message that the candidate is the formal nominee for

the Republican Party. As discussed above, this is an impermissible depiction

by the candidate of his status in the judicial race; the insertion of the modifier

"Conservative" into the statement does not, in our view, dispel the

disingenuousness of the statement. Under the current state of affairs of

modern American politics, the Republican Party is commonly regarded as

occupying the conservative side of the political spectrum, and so the addition of

the modifier "Conservative" is surplusage, doing nothing to dispel the implied

falsehood that the candidate is running for Kentucky judicial office as the

formal candidate of the Republican Party.

   C. Answer to Question 1B: Would a candidate's statement that his
      opponent was "the Democrat candidate for Judge" or the "Liberal
      Democrat for Judge" violate the Canon?

      The statement by a candidate that his opponent is "the Democrat

candidate for Judge" is an impermissible message to the voters. His opponent

is not, in fact, the Democrat candidate for Judge. As previously explained,

such candidates do not exist in Kentucky, and such a campaign message

would therefore amount to a blatant falsehood.    See Canon 5B(1)(c) (prohibiting

materially false statements).


                                        15
       Similarly, a statement by a candidate that his opponent is "the Liberal

Democrat for Judge" is likewise impermissible. For the identical reasons

discussed above, the modern Democratic Party is widely acknowledged as

falling within the liberal segment of the political spectrum. There is no

meaningful difference between stating that someone is "the Liberal Democrat

for Judge" as opposed to "the Democrat for Judge." Both phrasings imply the

false and misleading message that the opponent is the Democratic Party

nominee for judge.

   D. Summary

       In summary, judicial candidates may "affiliate," 8 that is "portray"

themselves as members of a political party without restriction; what they may

not do under Canon 5A(1)(b), in tandem with Canon 5B(1)(c), is portray

themselves, either directly or by implication, as the official nominee of a

political party.


                         V. QUESTION 2     -   CANON 5A(1)(B)

      The second question concerns Canon 5A(1)(b). This Canon states as

follows:

      Canon 5. A judge or judicial candidate shall refrain from
      inappropriate political activity.

      A. Political Conduct in General

      (1) Except as permitted by law, a judge or a candidate for election
      to judicial office shall not:

      8 Merriam Webster defines "affiliate" as "to closely connect (something or
                   -



yourself) with or to something (such as a program or organization) as a member or
partner[.1" http://www.merriam-webster.corn/dictionary/affiliate (January 2016).

                                         16
       (b) act as a leader or hold any office in a political organization.

    A. Answer to Question 2: Canon 5A(1)(b) states that a judge or judicial
       candidate shall not "act as a leader or hold any office in a political
       organization." What constitutes "act[ing] as a leader or hold[ing]
       any office"?
       "Holding any office" in a political organization means occupying a formal

position with a recognized title or performing a function within the established

organizational structure of an association whose principal purpose is to further

the election or appointment of candidates to political office. An "office" in such

an organization includes recognized titles such as chairman, director,

secretary, treasurer, press secretary, precinct leader, membership recruiter,

youth coordinator, and the like.

       "Acting as a leader" encompasses a less formal but broader range of

participation. Matter of Disciplinary Proceeding Against Blauvelt, 801 P.2d 235,

238 (1990), 9 notes that Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1283

(1986), defines leader, among other ways, as "a person who by force of

example, talents, or qualities of leadership plays a directing role, wields

commanding influence, or has a following in any sphere of activity or thought."

"Acting as a leader," therefore, captures efforts to advance the political agenda

of the party in a less formal way through proactive planning, organizing,



       9 Blauvelt addressed a judicial canon substantially identical to Canon 5A(1)(b)
and held that a judge serving as a delegate to political party's county convention was a
"leader" within meaning of the canon's prohibition against a judge acting as a "leader"
in a political organization.

                                           17
directing, and controlling of party functions with the goal of achieving success

for the political party. These less formalized, leader-without-title, positions

would include, for example, acting formally or informally as a party

spokesperson; organizing, managing, or recruiting new members; organizing or

managing campaigns; fundraising; and performing other roles exerting

influence or authority over the rank and file membership albeit without a

formal title, including as further discussed below, hosting political events.

   B. Answer to Question 2A: As applied to this case, would hosting
      events for a political party violate the Canon?

       Consistent with the definition of "acting as a leader," as just discussed,

one who hosts an event for a political party is "acting as a leader" for the party.

Merriam-Webster defines "host" as: "1 a: one that receives or entertains guests

socially, commercially, or officially; b: one that provides facilities for an event or

function . . . ." 1-0 Therefore, someone who provides the facilities for an event of

a political party or officially receives the political party attendees is, indeed,

acting as a "leader" of a political party. The "host" of an event, political or

otherwise, uses the prestige of his or her name to promote the event and exerts

a significant measure of control and authority over the event, more so, in our

view, than the more passive political delegate function in Blauvelt. Perforce, a

judicial candidate hosting a political event acts as a leader of that event and is,

in turn, acting as a leader of the political party on whose behalf the political

event is being held. Under Canon 5A(1)(b) that is prohibited conduct.

                          VI. QUESTION III - CANON 5B(1)(C)

       The final questions posed by the District Court concern the misleading

speech prohibition by a judicial candidate contained in Canon 5B(1)(c). Canon

5B(1)(c) provides, in relevant part, as follows:

       B. Campaign Conduct.

       (1) A judge or candidate for election to judicial office:



       (c) shall not . . . with reckless disregard for the truth, misrepresent
       any candidate's identity, qualifications, present position, or make
       any other false or misleading statements.


   A. Answer to Question 3: Canon 5B(1)(c) states that a judge or judicial
      candidate "shall not knowingly, or with reckless disregard for the
      truth, misrepresent any candidate's identity, qualifications, present
      position, or make any other false or misleading statements." What
      constitutes a false statement?

       A falser statement is a statement that is not factually true in the normal

sense; that is, an untrue utterance. For example, it would include such

statements as: "I graduated first in my class" when the candidate did not; "I

have won all of my cases as an attorney" when the candidate had not; "I was an

officer in the military" when the candidate was not; or "my opponent was

convicted of a drug offense" when the opponent was not. 12



         11 Merriam-Webster defines false as "not real or genuine: not true or accurate;

especially: deliberately untrue: done or said to fool or deceive someone."
http:/ / www.merriam-web sten com/ +dictionary/ false (January 2016) .
        12 In United States v. Alvarez, 132 S. Ct. 2537 (2012), the Supreme Court held
that false statements generally are not a category of unprotected speech exempt from
the normal prohibition on content-based restrictions. Id. at 2547 (striking down a
federal statute which prohibited lying about military awards). (Per opinion of Justice
Kennedy, with three Justices concurring and two Justices concurring in the
                                            19
         The provision does not, however, cover expressions of opinion because

expressions of an opinion do not implicate a statement that is not factually

true. For example such statements as "Justice Stevens was the best Justice

ever"; "Citizens United was the best decision ever"; or "my opponent is too

liberal" are all expressions of opinion and not subject to Canon 5B(1)(c).

         In summary, Canon 5B(1)(c) extends only to statements made during a

campaign which are objectively factually untrue and do not extend to

expressions of subjective opinions or innocuous campaign-trail "puffing" ("I am

the most qualified candidate in the state.").

    B. Answer to Question 3A: As applied to this case, would it include a
       candidate who asks voters to "re-elect" her to a second term even
       though she was appointed to her first term?

         The prefix "re" affixed to a verb implies that the action described in the

verb has occurred on a previous occasion. 13 For example, if a television

network announces that it will rerun a particular program, it has implicitly but

definitively asserted that the program had been run on a prior occasion; it is

implied that a soldier who re-enlists in the army had enlisted in the military on

a prior occasion; and something can be reasserted only if it has previously

been asserted.




judgment). However, the Court pointedly exempted from the scope of the decision
laws aimed at "maintain[ing] the general good repute and dignity of . . . government . .
 . service itself." Id. at 2546 (citing United States v. Lepowitch, 318 U.S. 702, 704, 63 S.
Ct. 914, 87 L.Ed. 1091 (1943)). Because the canons we address fall squarely within
this exception, we are persuaded that Alvarez does not apply here.

                                            20
       Given this universally accepted convention of the English language, a

candidate's request for voters to re elect her to a judicial office is an affirmative
                                     -




assertion that she had been elected by voters to the same office on a prior

occasion. A judge who holds her office by way of a gubernatorial appointment

cannot honestly claim that she was elected to the office, and if she seeks to

retain the office at the next election, she cannot honestly assert that she seeks

to be re elected. Such an assertion would be a materially false statement,
        -




deceptive to the public, and would run afoul of Canon 5B(1)(c).

      The opponents of the canon cite to various court decisions and news

articles where the term "re-elect" was used to describe a judge who was seeking

to retain an office attained by appointment rather than election. Using the

term in news articles and other narratives to chronicle historic events is an

informal and idiomatic phrasing, but it is nonetheless inaccurate.

      In contrast, when an incumbent judge uses the word "re-elect" as

campaign stratagem to persuade the public that she acquired the office by the

popular vote of the people rather than as the appointee of a governor, its use is

calculated to mislead and deceive the voters. Accordingly, we distinguish these

informal, idiomatic usages and regard these journalistic references as

irrelevant to our review.


                       VII.      CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW
      The closing step to interpreting a statute or other legal authority, such as

the canons interpreted herein, is undertaking a final examination to ascertain

that our interpretation complies with any existing constitutional mandates. We

                                         21
have undertaken that review and are satisfied that our interpretations as

expressed above fall well within the requirements of White, Carey, Williams-

 Yulee, and other applicable First Amendment authorities.

       Nevertheless, we are attentive that in its Injunction Order, the District

Court expressed its skepticism regarding the constitutionality of each of the

canons under review. In response to that skepticism, we emphasize that we

are persuaded that Williams-Yulee resolves the District Court's criticism in

favor of the interpretations expressed herein. For example, the District Court

criticizes our campaign limitation, expressed in Canon 5A(1)(a), as being

underinclusive 14 because it fails to address the practical reality that, in lieu of

the candidate directly portraying himself as the favored candidate of a political

party, his supporters and surrogates may undertake that same function. The

District Court is correct; we do not purport to limit the campaign conduct of

supporters and surrogates. But the Court's criticism ignores the fact that the

compelling interest served by our canon is to insulate the judge personally from

behaviors that directly undermine the impartiality and objectivity of the

Kentucky Court of Justice. That others outside the judiciary may pursue these

political objectives on behalf of the judge or judicial candidate does not in any

way diminish our objective. If anything, it is a factor that favors the

constitutionality of our canon by emphasizing its limited impact on political




       14"[U]nderindusiveness can raise 'doubts about whether the government is in
fact pursuing the interest it invokes, rather than disfavoring a particular speaker or
viewpoint.' Williams Yulee, 135 S. Ct. at 1668.
                     -




                                          22
discourse. The objective is not to keep information hidden from the public; the

objective is to keep the judge from compromising his or her integrity and

impartiality by engaging in deceptive and misleading conduct.

        Williams-Yulee presented a very similar situation. While the Florida rules

prohibited a judge from personally soliciting funds, responsible representatives

were permitted to do so on her behalf. Against the underinclusiveness

argument, the United States Supreme Court noted: "A State need not address

all aspects of a problem in one fell swoop; policymakers may focus on their

most pressing concerns. We have accordingly upheld laws—even under strict

scrutiny—that conceivably could have restricted even greater amounts of

speech in service of their stated interests." 135 S. Ct. at 1668. By the same

force of reasoning, our Canon 5A(1)(a) is not underinclusive; 15 nor are the other

judicial canons we have discussed.

       The District Court likewise criticizes our canons as overbroad in that

they may be construed to extend beyond the range of prohibitable speech and

reach non-prohibitable speech. 16 In drafting our canons, we strived to avoid

overbreadth and the clarifications expressed herein should obviate that

concern. In any event, Williams-Yulee addressed the same point and the same



       15 And further, of course we have no jurisdiction over the judicial candidate's
supporters and surrogates; however that does not mean we are powerless over those
whom we do have jurisdiction from misleading the public into believing that they are
the officially sanctioned nominee of a political party.
        16 The overbreadth doctrine "is predicated on the danger that an overly broad
statute, if left in place, may cause persons whose expression is constitutionally
protected to refrain from exercising their rights for fear of criminal sanctions."
Massachusetts v. Oakes, 491 U.S. 576, 581 (1989).

                                          23
compelling interests were at stake. There, the Supreme Court observed that

"The First Amendment requires that [the personal solicitation canon] be

narrowly tailored, not that it be 'perfectly tailored.' The impossibility of perfect

tailoring is especially apparent when the State's compelling interest is as

intangible as public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary." 135 S. Ct. at

1671 (citation omitted). The same principle applies in this situation as we

strive to protect the democratic ideal of citizens choosing their judges and, at

the same time, preserve the neutrality of the judicial branch by insulating

judges from detrimental influences of partisan politics. Perhaps we have not

achieved the ideal-but-elusive "perfect tailoring," but nevertheless our tailoring

comports with the standard prescribed in Williams-Yulee.

       The District Court also suggests in its Injunction Order that the canons

at issue are unconstitutionally vague; 17 however, as we discuss herein, a plain,

ordinary, and common sense application of the language of the canons gives

accurate guidance to a judicial candidate of what he may or may not do in a

political campaign: he may not campaign as the nominee of a political party; he

may not act as an office holder or leader, in the traditional sense of those

terms, of a political party and he may not lie to the public on the campaign

trail, although he is free to otherwise express his opinion on matters relating to

himself, his opponent, and matters of public interest. It bears emphasis as



       17 "[The void-for-vagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define the
criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what
conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and
discriminatory enforcement." Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357 (1983).

                                          24
well that Kentucky's Judicial Conduct Commission maintains an ethics

advisory structure which is available to judicial candidates seeking specific

advice or guidance on campaign matters.


                                  VIII. CONCLUSION

      The law as set forth above is hereby certified to the United States District

Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky.

      All sitting. Minton, C.J.; Cunningham, Hughes, Keller, and Venters, JJ.,

concur. Noble, J., concurs in part and dissents in part by separate opinion in

which Wright, J., joins.

      NOBLE, J., CONCURRING IN PART AND DISSENTING IN PART: I concur

with Justice Venters' excellent analysis on all the issues in this case except for

his answer to question IA, as to whether the statement "I am the only

Republican candidate for judge" is permissible. I do not think it is. In the same

discussion, he concludes that it is NOT permissible to say, "I am the

conservative Republican candidate for judge." Both the term "only" and the

term "conservative" are modifiers and immediately precede the phrase

"Republican candidate." Thus, whatever the modifier may be, both sentences

are discussing "the...Republican candidate." As the majority explains,

Republicans (Democrats) do not have a party candidate in non-partisan judicial

elections, and saying that one is "the Republican candidate" is inappropriate

and misleading. I can make no distinction between the two sentences at issue,

and thus would find that neither is permissible. Our Constitution requires that

judicial candidates be non-partisan candidates, and declaring oneself to be any

                                        25
kind of Republican (or Democratic) candidate adds partisanship to the actual

candidacy, rather than stating in which political party one has membership.

     Wright, J., joins.

NUMBER 13-00-389-CV
COURT OF APPEALS
THIRTEENTH DISTRICT OF TEXAS
CORPUS CHRISTI
__________________________________________________________________

DAVID B. MOORE , Appellant,

v.

ARTHUR ANDERSEN, L.L.P. AND LAURA MAWHINNEY , Appellees.
__________________________________________________________________

On appeal from the 44th District Court
of Dallas County, Texas.
__________________________________________________________________

O P I N I O N
Before Justices Hinojosa, Rodriguez, and Hill (1)
Opinion by Justice Hill

David Moore appeals from a summary judgment that he take nothing in his claims of sex discrimination and harassment,
wrongful discharge, defamation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress against Arthur Andersen, L.L.P., and Laura
Mawhinney.  He contends in four points that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment as to each of those four
claims.  We affirm because the trial court did not err by granting summary judgment as to Moore's claims.
Moore sued appellees after he was fired by Andersen.  His claims for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional
distress were made against both appellees, while his claims for sex discrimination and harassment and wrongful discharge
were directed solely against Andersen.  In response to his claims as they are outlined above, Appellees filed a motion for
summary judgment, a motion to which Moore responded.  As previously noted, the trial court granted summary judgment
that Moore take nothing as to all of his claims.
Appellees' motion for summary judgment reflects that it is brought both as a traditional and as a no-evidence motion for
summary judgment because it states that it is brought under Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 166a(b) and 166a(i).  Further,
as to each cause of action brought by Moore, it alleges that there is no evidence as to an essential element of each claim, as
required by Rule 166a(i).  See Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(i). Rule 166a(i) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provides that:
After adequate time for discovery, a party without presenting summary judgment evidence may move for summary
judgment on the ground that there is no evidence of one or more essential elements of a claim or defense on which an
adverse party would have the burden of proof at trial.  The motion must state the elements as to which there is no evidence. 
The court must grant the motion unless the respondent produces summary judgment evidence raising a genuine issue of
material fact.

Id. 

When such a motion is presented, the movant does not bear the burden of establishing each element of its own claim or
defense.  See Ford v. City State Bank of Palacios, 44 S.W.3d 121, 128 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi 2001, no pet.).  The
burden then shifts to the nonmovant to present enough evidence to be entitled to a trial: evidence that raises a genuine fact
issue on the challenged elements.  Id.  If the nonmovant is unable to present enough evidence, the trial judge must grant the
motion.  Id.
A no-evidence motion for summary judgment is improperly granted if the nonmovant presents more than a scintilla of
probative evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact.  Id.  Less than a scintilla of evidence exists when the evidence
is so weak as to do no more than create a mere surmise or suspicion of a fact.  Id.  More than a scintilla of evidence exists
when the evidence rises to a level that would enable reasonable and fair-minded people to differ in their conclusions.  Id. 
We first consider whether Appellees were entitled to a no-evidence motion for summary judgment.            
 SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION
With respect to Moore's claim of sexual harassment and sex discrimination, Andersen maintains in its motion for summary
judgment that Moore can produce no evidence that Mawhinney created a sexually hostile work environment or
discriminated against him because of his sex.  Moore's claim is a statutory claim based upon the Texas Human Rights Act,
Texas Labor Code section 21.001, et seq., which provides in section 21.051 as follows:
An employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because of race, color, disability, religion, sex, national origin,
or age the employer:
1. fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or discriminates in any other manner against an individual
in connection with compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment; or
2. limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or applicant for employment in a manner that would deprive or tend to
deprive an individual of any employment opportunity or adversely affect in any other manner the status of an employee.

Tex. Lab. Code ANN.§ 21.051 (Vernon 1996).   

We will first consider Moore's contentions as they relate to his claim against Andersen for sex discrimination and
harassment.  According to Moore's affidavit, attached to his response,  Mawhinney, his project manager at Andersen, gave
him a memorandum that she had prepared for the file.  In that memorandum, Mawhinney discussed observations of
Moore's work and behavior.  She observed that Moore spent "too much time 'chatting' with multiple female client personnel
at the client site.  This was perceived as flirtatious behavior by both the client and Barry's project team member and was
brought to the attention of the project manager at a client dinner meeting."  In addition to her observation, Mawhinney's
memo contained the following under the heading "Action" with respect to that observation:
On Wednesday, July 1st, 1998, Laura discussed this issue with Barry at the New Orleans airport.  I emphasized the
importance of Barry maintaining professional relationships with client personnel and focusing on project tasks, (which is
what the client is paying AA to do).  Additionally, I told Barry, that while developing client relationships are important, that
he should be focusing mainly on tasks at his level, and when working on relationship-building, that it should occur more
often with the client's managers, rather than the accounting clerks.  It was reported to me that Barry's behavior changed in
the right direction after our discussion. 

Mawhinney further stated in the memo that:

Throughout the week, I observed Barry engaged in multiple conversations with multiple female employees, sometimes
lasting 20-30 minutes at a time.  In the course of one day, I would suspect that he worked six of eight hours.  Barry should
have had a full week's worth of work to do, but if for some reason he did not, he never bothered to offer assistance to his
project team member with demo scripts, or ask for additional work. 

The bulk of the memo was directed to other types of examples of poor job performance on Moore's part. As can be seen,
Mawhinney referred to Moore as Barry in the memorandum.
Moore states in his affidavit that on the next working day, Monday, July 27, 1998, he went to Andersen's office of human
resources and talked to Linda Ferguson.  He indicates that after telling her he wanted to talk to her about sexual harassment,
he complained that Mawhinney was directing agitated and antagonistic behavior toward him and was creating a hostile
work environment.  Moore says that he prepared a detailed rebuttal of the charges in Mawhinney's memo and followed the
instructions given him by Ferguson.  The affidavit reflects that on the following Friday, July 31, 1998, Moore was called to
the office of Andersen's Director of Human Resources, Scott Wilson, who advised him that it "appears you are a flirt." 
According to Moore, Wilson then summarily fired him for sexual harassment.  Moore observed in his deposition that
several employees at Andersen declined to read his response to Mawhinney's memo, including Jeff Valentine and Paul
Shultz.   
Andersen, in a letter to the Texas Workforce Commission, stated that Moore was fired for sexual harassment and
forwarded its sexual harassment policy to the commission, but Wilson, Andersen's Director of Human Resources, indicated 
he had told the person who wrote the letter that it was incorrect and should have read that he was terminated for
unprofessional conduct.  Wilson stated that the person who wrote the information got it from the file by looking at the notes
he prepared, but that he did not know how she concluded that Moore was terminated for sexual harassment.  Wilson
acknowledged that Andersen has no code number for termination for sexual harassment.  Wilson indicated that the
employee who made the error is a competent employee and that he was not aware of it ever happening before.  
In a telephone conversation between Wilson and Moore after Moore's termination, Wilson related to Moore that he had
interviewed seven women.  He told Moore that they had indicated that Moore asked them about whom they were dating
and whether they were dating anyone.  Wilson told Moore that all of them felt very uncomfortable in that situation.  Moore
denied the accusations, but Wilson told him that he knew of at least two instances in which there were others who
overheard the conversation.  Although Wilson did not, in his notes, put the word "uncomfortable" in quotes, he indicated
that one or more of the women used that term, that it was not just his term.  Wilson also indicated in his deposition that he,
Schultz, and Ja Chriesman, another Andersen employee, would have read Mawhinney's memo.  He stated that he had read
Moore's response, that he thought Shultz read it, and that he would have thought that Chriesman and Mawhinney read it. 
However, he acknowledged that he did not know for sure that they had read it.
In her deposition, Mawhinney testified that, prior to working on the Friede Goldman project with Moore, she had never
observed him engaging in flirtatious behavior and no one had told her that he had.  As to her observations on the project,
Mawhinney indicated that she would not say whether she had or had not observed flirtatious behavior.  She stated that she
suspected that flirtatious behavior was occurring. Mawhinney testified concerning a meeting she had with Wilson and 
Chriesman on Thursday prior to Moore's termination.  She had learned of the meeting while out of town through an urgent
voice mail from Wilson's office assistant wanting to know when she and Chriesman would be returning to the office. When
they returned to town, she and Chriesman went directly to Wilson's office.  She indicated that she did not, after the meeting,
give any names of complaining females to Nancy Werner, the Andersen employee who investigated the matters involved
here, because she thought that "[T]hey already had most of all the evidence they apparently needed."  Mawhinney stated in
the deposition that she played no role whatsoever in Moore being fired. 
Werner investigated the complaints concerning Moore prior to his termination and verified that Moore made inappropriate
comments to female employees that made them feel uncomfortable and that at least one employee indicated that she would
never staff her projects with a female who was subordinate to him.  At Moore's request, Wilson personally investigated the
allegations after he terminated Moore. 
Moore contends that a memo from Werner "states unequivocally" that she got the names of complaining women from
Mawhinney, but our review of that memo shows that it does not reflect that Mawhinney gave her the names, only that she
began her investigation after meeting with Mawhinney, Chriesman, and Wilson.
In support of his conclusion that he filed a sexual harassment complaint, Moore refers us to his deposition testimony that he
went to talk to Linda Ferguson about sexual harassment, then told her that Mawhinney was acting very antagonistically
toward him.  Moore could not recall if he had given Ferguson any examples.      
Moore stated in his deposition that he was replaced by a female whose qualifications were not as good as his for the job. 
He did not elaborate as to how she was less qualified nor give any source of his knowledge as to her qualifications. 
Under the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act, it is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an individual
with respect to compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of race, color, disability,
religion, sex, or national origin.  Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 21.051 (Vernon 1996) (formerly Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art.
5221k, § 5.01(1)); Garcia v. Schwab, 967 S.W.2d 883, 885 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi 1998, no pet.).  The Human Rights
Act is modeled after federal law for the purpose of executing the policies embodied in Title VII of the federal Civil Rights
Act of 1964.  See Tex. Labor Code Ann. § 21.001 (Vernon 1996); Garcia, 967 S.W.2d at 885.  One form of employment
discrimination is sexual harassment.  Garcia, 967 S.W.2d at 885. 
Moore's sexual harassment claim is a hostile work environment form of sexual harassment.  Such a claim includes the
following elements: (1) the plaintiff belongs to a protected group; (2) the plaintiff was subject to unwelcome sexual
harassment; (3) the harassment complained of was based upon sex; (4) the harassment complained of affected a "term,
condition, or privilege" of employment; and (5) the employer knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to
take remedial action.  Id.  Title VII is violated when the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule,
and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a discriminatorily hostile or abusive working environment. 
Meritor Sav. Bank FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 64, 67 (1986).  Conduct that is not severe enough to create a work
environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive will not trigger Title VII or its Texas equivalent. 
Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993); Garcia, 967 S.W.2d at 885.  Whether an environment is "hostile" or 
"abusive" can be determined only by reviewing all the circumstances, which may include the frequency of the conduct; its
severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably
interferes with an employee's work performance.  Harris, 510 U.S. at 23; Garcia, 967 S.W.2d at 885-86.  Considering all
of the summary judgment evidence, including that we have outlined above, we hold that Moore has failed to present
evidence showing that he was subjected to a hostile work environment of the severity required to maintain his claim for
sexual harassment. 
We now turn to Moore's claim of sexual discrimination.  The plaintiff in a Title VII trial must carry the initial burden of
establishing a prima facie case of discrimination.  McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 803 (1973).  Such a
prima facie case requires a showing that (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he was otherwise qualified for his
position; (3) he was discharged by the defendant; and (4) the respondent replaced him with someone outside his protected
class.  Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 142 (2000).  We hold that Moore presented a prima facie
case. 
Once Moore presented a prima facie case, it was appellees' burden to produce evidence that the plaintiff was rejected, or
someone else was preferred, for a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason.  Id.  Andersen and Mawhinney presented evidence
that Moore was terminated because of speaking with women in an inappropriate way that made them feel uncomfortable. 
Once the appellees met that burden, the presumptions and burdens discussed in McDonnell Douglas disappeared.  Id. at
142-43.  The ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the
plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff.  Id. at 143.  Whether judgment as a matter of law is appropriate depends on
a number of factors, including the strength of the plaintiff's prima facie case, the probative value of the proof that the
employer's explanation is false, and any other evidence that supports the employer's case that might properly be considered
on a motion for judgment as a matter of law.  Id.  at 148-49.  In making that determination we are to review the record as a
whole.  Id.  at 150. 
In this case there is nothing particularly remarkable about Moore's prima facie case.  He merely established that he was a
male, was otherwise qualified for his job, was terminated, and was replaced by a female.  He was terminated following an
investigation showing that he engaged in conversations with specified individuals in which he made statements and asked
questions that were inappropriate in a business setting and that made women uncomfortable.  Moore never presented
evidence showing that these specific accusations were untrue or that such information was not in fact presented to
Andersen. Therefore, he presented no evidence showing that the nondiscriminatory reason for firing him was pretextual.
In urging that he presented evidence showing that Andersen's reason was pretextual, Moore refers to evidence showing that
Andersen initially reported he was fired for sexual harassment, then changed the reason to unprofessional conduct,
asserting that the original report was a mistake.  Regardless of whether Andersen chose to call it sexual harassment or
unprofessional conduct, evidence showed Andersen terminated Moore based on certain conduct on his part that Moore
never denied.  Inasmuch as Moore never denied that conduct, he presented no evidence that the reason for his firing was
pretextual.  
Moore cites several examples of discrimination on the part of Andersen.  We will consider all of these individually.  First,
Moore argues that Andersen fired him for sexual harassment, without a shred of evidence to support the firing.  During his
discussion, he refers to the investigation by  Werner, but does not mention that her investigation substantiated the
observations made by Mawhinney in her memo.  He indicates that there never was a proper investigation, but does not
explain why Werner's investigation was improper.  
Moore complains that Andersen immediately acted upon Mawhinney's memo to discharge him.  He does not mention that
he was not fired until Werner's investigation confirmed the observations in Mawhinney's memo.  He also suggests that his
claim of sexual harassment against Mawhinney was ignored.  While an investigation showed the justification for his being
fired for a nondiscriminatory reason, Moore has not shown that he ever indicated to Andersen in what way, if any,
Mawhinney was supposed to have been guilty of sexual harassment or discrimination against him.  Further, there is no
evidence in the record indicating that she discriminated against Moore in any way on the basis of his gender or committed
any other act that was improper under the Texas Labor Code or Title VII. 
Moore states that he was replaced by a female, a female who he says is not as qualified as he for the position.  As
previously noted, he never says in what way she was less qualified or what the source of his knowledge as to her
qualifications might be.
Moore relates that Andersen retaliated against him by firing him only four days after he filed sexual harassment charges
against Mawhinney, in violation of Andersen's own policy.  Other than Moore's conclusory statement that he filed a sexual
harassment complaint, Moore's own affidavit indicates that he talked to Linda Ferguson in Andersen's human resources
department about sexual harassment, then proceeded to tell her that Mawhinney was directing agitated and antagonistic
behavior toward him and was creating a hostile work environment.  Even if Moore did file a claim of sexual harassment
against Mawhinney, there is nothing to suggest that he ever indicated to Ferguson or anyone else any facts that would serve
as a basis for believing that any antagonistic or hostile behavior on Mawhinney's part was directed at him because of his
gender. 
Finally, Moore urges that Andersen discriminated against him by contesting his application with the Texas Workforce
Commission for employment benefits with a letter falsely charging him with sexual harassment.  Although Andersen chose
to characterize the reason for Moore's termination as unprofessional conduct rather than sexual harassment, the nature of
conduct for which it terminated Moore would, if sufficiently severe, constitute sexual harassment.  Even if it were not so
severe, and even if the letter was not sent in error, as urged by Andersen, there is nothing in the record indicating that the
sending of this letter constituted discrimination against Moore based upon his gender.  We find that there is no more than a
scintilla of evidence that Moore ever actually filed a sexual harassment complaint against Mawhinney, and, even if he did,
no more than a scintilla of evidence that Andersen or Mawhinney discriminated against Moore on the basis of gender.  We
overrule point one.  
WRONGFUL DISCHARGE
Moore urges in point two that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on his claim for wrongful discharge.  The
appellees urge that he has failed to show a binding contract of employment that would modify Moore's status as an
employee at will.  The general rule in Texas is that, absent a specific agreement to the contrary, employment may be
terminated by the employer or the employee at will, for good cause, bad cause, or no cause at all.  Montgomery County
Hosp. Dist. v. Brown, 965 S.W.2d 501, 502 (Tex. 1998).  For such an employment contract to exist, the employer must
unequivocally indicate a definite intent to be bound not to terminate the employee except under clearly specified
circumstances. Id.  In support of his argument that there was such an employment contract, Moore refers to that portion of
Andersen's anti-harassment policy that states, "We will support any employee who believes he or she has been unlawfully
harassed by his or her supervisor, coworker or third party in a work-related situation." We do not view this as an
unequivocal statement by Andersen that it was bound not to terminate an employee except under clearly specified
circumstances.  Consequently, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment on this issue.  
Moore relies upon the cases of Morgan v. Jack Brown Cleaners, Inc., 764 S.W.2d 825 (Tex. App.-Austin 1989, writ
denied) and Goodyear Tire and Rubber v. Portilla, 879 S.W.2d 47, 52 (Tex. 1994).  We first note that in Morgan the court
did not consider whether the employer's promise that if a certain department ever closed, it would find a job for her within
the company, was definite enough to constitute an enforceable contract.  Brown, 965 S.W.2d at 503.  The Supreme Court
disapproved of the holding inMorgan to the extent that it was inconsistent with Brown.  Id.  In Goodyear, which was also
decided before Brown, the court relied on Morgan as probably "[The] Texas case closest in point."  Goodyear, 879 S.W.2d
at 51.  In any event, we find both cases distinguishable because in each of those cases there was a specific agreement not to
terminate the employee under a specific circumstance, whereas in the case at bar there is no specific agreement not to
terminate the employee.  We overrule point two. 
DEFAMATION
Moore contends in point three that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on his claim for defamation.  He
insists that Mawhinney accused him of flirtatious behavior in her memo.  In their motion for summary judgment, appellees
contend that there is no evidence that they published a defamatory statement about Moore because the term "flirtatious" is a
nonactionable opinion that is not capable of a defamatory meaning.  As previously noted, the memo states that too much
time spent chatting with female personnel was perceived by the client and Moore's team member as flirtatious behavior. 
Later in the memo, Mawhinney states that Moore needed to improve his professionalism.  She said, "Whether his behavior
has been flirtatious or not, if someone perceives that it is, then there is a problem."  When one reads the memo as a whole,
one sees that the memo does not state that Moore is flirtatious, only that he is perceived to be by some, and that such a
perception constitutes a problem.  We conclude, therefore, that Mawhinney did not publish a defamatory statement against
Moore. 
Even if Mawhinney did publish a statement that Moore was flirtatious, it has been held that such a statement is too
imprecise in nature to be an actionable defamatory statement.  Lee v. Metro. Airport Comm., 428 N.W.2d 815, 821 (Minn.
App. 1988).
In support of his argument that a publication that he was flirtatious would be an actionable defamatory statement, Moore
relies upon the case of Scribner v. Waffle House, Inc., 14 F. Supp.2d 873, 915 (ND 1998), vacated at 62 F. Supp.2d 1186
(1999).  Under the heading "Defamatory Meaning" Moore states that "A charge that the Plaintiff was "vulgar and
flirtatious" was found to be untrue, and supported (together with other facts) a judgment in excess of $6 million for the
Plaintiff for sexual harassment, defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress."  Unlike Moore, Therese
Scribner, the plaintiff in that case, was a victim of pervasive sexual harassment by a number of individuals over an
extended period of time.  Scribner, 14 F.Supp.2d at 891.  Although the trial court found that witnesses in the trial lied when
they accused Scribner of being vulgar and flirtatious, Scribner's claim of defamation did not involve any statements
accusing her of being a flirt or being flirtatious.  Id. at 935.  Furthermore, as noted in the citation, the opinion in Scribner
has been vacated.  Scribner v. Waffle House, Inc., 62 F.Supp.2d 1186 (N.D. 1999).  We overrule point three.
INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS
Moore argues in point four that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment on his claim for intentional infliction of
emotional distress.  In response to Moore's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, the appellees contend in
their motion for summary judgment that there was no evidence that they engaged in any conduct that constitutes intentional
infliction of emotional distress. 
To recover damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff must prove that: (1) the defendant acted
intentionally or recklessly; (2) the conduct was extreme and outrageous; (3) the actions of the defendant caused the plaintiff
emotional distress; and (4) the resulting emotional distress was severe.  GTE Southwest, Inc. v. Bruce, 998 S.W.2d 605, 611
(Tex. 1999) 
To be extreme and outrageous, conduct must be "so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree as to go beyond all
possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.  Id. 
Generally, insensitive or even rude behavior does not constitute extreme and outrageous conduct.  Id. at 612.  Mere insults,
indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities do not rise to the level of extreme and outrageous
conduct.  Id.  
Texas courts have adopted a strict approach to intentional infliction of emotional distress claims arising in the workplace,
relying on the fact that, to properly manage its business, an employer must be able to supervise, review, criticize, demote,
transfer, and discipline employees.  Id.  Although many of these acts are necessarily unpleasant for the employee, an
employer must have latitude to exercise these rights in a permissible way, even though emotional distress results.  Id. 
Consequently, in Texas, a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress does not lie for ordinary employment
disputes.  Id.  The extreme and outrageous conduct required in such a cause of action in the workplace exists only in the
most unusual of circumstances.  Id. at 613.  The evidence Moore has presented in response to the appellees' motion for
summary judgment is evidence of an ordinary employment dispute, not of extreme and outrageous conduct of such a nature
as is required to maintain a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.  
Moore claims that the facts in this case are similar to those in GTE Southwest.  To the contrary, the facts in GTE Southwest
show a much more extreme situation.  The supervisor in GTE Southwest was a former U. S. Army supply sergeant who
committed ongoing acts of harassment, intimidation and humiliation and who engaged in daily obscene and vulgar
behavior.  Id. at 608, 617.  The supervisor created a workplace that was a "den of terror" for the employees, purposefully
humiliating and intimidating the employees, repeatedly putting them in fear of their physical well-being.  Id.  His abusive
conduct was common, not rare.  Id.  Our opinion does not conflict with GTE Southwest. 
Moore also relies upon the case of Bushell v. Dean, 781 S.W.2d 652 (Tex. App.--Austin 1989), rev'd in part on other
grounds, 803 S.W.2d 711 (Tex. 1991).  In that case Dean's supervisor, Bushell, over a four-month period brought her
things for breakfast, called her "My Sweet Mary," and told off-color jokes and talked about his marital sex problems with
her and other employees.  Id. at 657-58.  He told Dean that he liked her split skirt and remarked about the shape of her
body.  Id. at 658.  Bushell touched her several times.  Id.  Dean claimed that once, when Dean hugged him to thank him for
a favor, Bushell tried to kiss her.  Id.  The next month, Bushell rubbed her neck although she did not ask him to and he had
made no offer to do so.  Id.  He stopped when she asked him to.  Id.  During the next two months Bushell poked Dean in
the ribs two or three times.  Id.  Bushell told Dean he loved her and desired a sexual encounter.  Id.  Subsequently, on two
separate occasions, Bushell told her of his love and desire for sexual relations.  Id.  When Dean publicly rejected his
advances, Bushell became very formal toward Dean, referring to her as "Mrs. Dean" and speaking to her only of business
matters.  Id.  Later, when Bushell shouted at Dean during a dispute regarding a trucker's strike, she resigned.  Id. at 654. 
The court held that it was for the jury to determine whether Bushell's conduct was extreme and outrageous.  Even ifBushell
was correctly decided, it is distinguishable because it involved overt sexual harassment over an extended period of time,
whereas the evidence presented by Moore does not. 
Moore states that Bushell was cited with approval by the Texas Supreme Court in Wornick Co. v. Casas, 856 S.W.2d 732
(Tex. 1993).  In Wornick, Casas's employer, Right Away Foods Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Wornick
Company, terminated her and had her escorted off the premises by a security guard.  Id. at 734.  This was not standard
company policy for salaried employees such as Casas. Id.  Casas spoke to the president of Right Away on her way out.  Id. 
When Casas told him she disputed the allegations against her, he promised her a later meeting to discuss the matter, but he
never set up the meeting.  Id.  He led her to believe that she would be on leave of absence rather than terminated.  Id.  
An amicus curiae, the National Employment Lawyers Association, cited Bushell as a case where courts had found
outrageous conduct in the employment setting.  Id. at 735-36.  Holding that the evidence was insufficient to show that
Right Away's conduct was extreme or outrageous, the court distinguishedBushell, just as we have done, on the basis that it
involved repeated or ongoing harassment of an employee.  Id. at 736.  We disagree with Moore that this constitutes citing
Bushell with approval.  We overrule point four.  In view of our determination that Appellees were entitled to a no-evidence
summary judgment, we need not consider whether they were entitled to a traditional motion for summary judgment. 
The judgment is affirmed.

                                2
PER CURIAM:

            Mary      T.    LaClair,           individually          and     as     personal

representative of the estate of her husband, Cameron J. LaClair,

Jr.,     appeals    the     district          court’s    order       finding       that      the

Appellee,    Suburban       Hospital,          Inc.   (“Suburban”),          and    Physical

Therapy    and     Sports   Medicine          (“PTSM”),     were     joint     tortfeasors

with respect to her husband’s injuries sustained while he was a

patient    at    Suburban.            Mr.     LaClair    was    first       injured       while

receiving physical therapy at PTSM.                     After undergoing surgery at

Suburban for that injury, he was further injured by the actions

of Suburban’s patient care technicians.                         Suburban asks us to

affirm    the    district       court’s        conclusion      that     it    is    a     joint

tortfeasor with PTSM because its actions did not constitute a

superseding cause of harm to Mr. LaClair.

            In unraveling this appeal, Maryland law directs us to

several provisions of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, each of

which is grounded in the idea that an intervening act is not a

superseding      cause     if    it    was     foreseeable      at    the    time       of   the

primary negligence.             Because the harm and injuries sustained at

Suburban were foreseeable consequences of the alleged negligence

of PTSM, Suburban’s actions were not a superseding cause of Mr.

LaClair’s       injuries.             Thus,     Suburban       and    PTSM        are     joint

tortfeasors, and we affirm.



                                               3
                                        I.

                                        A.

            On November 1, 2007, Mr. LaClair, a “vibrant former

CIA officer” in his mid-80s, J.A. 211, 1 sustained an injury while

receiving physical therapy at the PTSM facility (the “November 1

incident”).       He was attempting to secure himself in a piece of

exercise equipment and fell onto the floor, while his physical

therapist    had    stepped   away.         He   was    taken    by     ambulance     to

Suburban, where he was diagnosed with a cervical fracture and

dislocation.

            Dr.     Alexandros     Powers,       a     neurosurgeon,         performed

surgery    on     Mr.   LaClair   on   November        3,    2007.         The   surgery

entailed    Dr.    Powers   inserting    screws        and    rods    to    secure   Mr.

LaClair’s    spine.       According    to    Dr.     Powers,    the     surgery      “was

successful and proceeded without complication, and Mr. LaClair’s

prognosis at that time included a complete and total recovery

free from future cervical spine surgery.”                   J.A. 227.

            Dr. Powers stated that, as of the morning of November

6, 2007, Mr. LaClair was “recovered and was to be discharged

[from Suburban] to a rehabilitation facility” the next day, and

“there was no plan or expectation for subsequent cervical spine

                                        4
surgeries due to the success of the November 3 surgery[.]”                        J.A.

228.     Later on November 6, Mr. LaClair was transferred from ICU

to a regular room, and his catheter was removed.                          He needed

assistance using the bathroom, and, after Mrs. LaClair called

several    times    for    assistance,       two     patient    care     technicians

responded.    Mr. LaClair used the bathroom, and the patient care

technicians attempted to reposition him in his hospital bed.

            Although      Suburban    claims    Mrs.     LaClair      “resort[s]    to

hyperbole when referring to the conduct of November 6,” and the

patient     care    technicians,        while        perhaps    negligent,        were

“performing    their      normal     duties    when     they    were     aiding    Mr.

LaClair and repositioning him in bed,” Br. of Appellee 6, Mrs.

LaClair    views    the    incident     as     out     of    bounds    because     her

husband’s “head was violently pushed against the side rail of

the bed and he cried out in pain,” Br. of Appellant 4.                            Mrs.

LaClair testified that one of the patient care technicians was

“very rough,” explaining, “her motions were gross motions.                        They

weren’t careful motions.           And I thought, with somebody with a

broken neck, I think I’d be careful, but there was none of

that.”    J.A. 362-63 (the “November 6 incident”).

            There    is    no   dispute       that     Mr.     LaClair    sustained

additional injuries as a result of the November 6 incident.                        Dr.

Powers examined Mr. LaClair and found “a fracture of the C7

endplate, dislocation at C6/C7, dislodging of the screws placed

                                         5
in previous surgery, ligament damage and hemorrhage, nerve root

injury at the level of C7 and C8 and spinal cord injury.”                        J.A.

228.     He determined Mr. LaClair could no longer be discharged on

November      7     as   previously    scheduled,        but   rather,      needed    to

undergo an additional surgery on November 8.                    Mr. LaClair later

underwent a third surgery on February 6, 2008, at Georgetown

University Hospital.             He spent nearly five months hospitalized,

underwent        plaster    casting    of    his    cervical    spine,      developed

bedsores, and ultimately required a feeding tube.

              Mrs. LaClair presented evidence to the district court

that   as    a     result   of   the   November     6    incident,    Mr.    LaClair’s

medical bills totaled over $1.05 million and had a projected

future      cost    of   $900,000.        Another       physician    testified       that

absent the November 6 incident, his medical and rehabilitation

expenses would have been only $75,000 to $125,000.

                                            B.

              The    LaClairs     filed     two    separate    lawsuits:       first,

against PTSM for injuries stemming from the November 1 incident

(filed March 19, 2009) (the “PTSM lawsuit”), and second, against

Suburban for “separate and distinct” injuries stemming from the




                                            6
November     6     incident      (filed    April      15,    2010)     (the    “Suburban

lawsuit”). 2

             The PTSM lawsuit alleged that PTSM was responsible for

not only the injuries and damages incurred from the November 1

incident at PTSM’s facility, but also the injuries and damages

incurred from the November 6 incident at Suburban.                        See J.A. 48

(PTSM Complaint) (“Plaintiff was taken via ambulance to Suburban

[]   where       he    was     diagnosed    with      a     cervical    fracture      and

dislocation.          Plaintiff remained at Suburban until November 13,

2007, where he underwent two surgical procedures to repair his

cervical     fracture,         among   other     things.”).      During       discovery,

however,     Dr.      Powers    testified       on   January    5,   2010,     that   the

injuries stemming from the November 1 incident were “separate,

distinct, and divisible” from those sustained by the November 6

incident.      Id. at 229, 262-329.

             Subsequently, the LaClairs settled with PTSM for $1

million on March 5, 2010.              The Settlement Agreement specifically

recognized that the LaClairs would be pursuing separate claims

against Suburban, in connection with the November 6 incident

alone:


     2
       Mr. LaClair passed away on November 4, 2011, during the
course of this litigation.   Mrs. LaClair took over as personal
representative of his estate and was substituted as Plaintiff on
January 25, 2012.



                                            7
            In any future action against [Suburban], the
       plaintiffs agree to file a pre-trial motion with the
       court attempting to establish that the conduct of
       Suburban   .    .   .    constituted   superintervening
       negligence, and that these defendants are not joint
       tortfeasors with Suburban[.]      The purpose of this
       requirement is to obviate the need for [PTSM] to be
       named as [a] part[y] in any future litigation.

J.A. 179.

              The Suburban lawsuit, filed about six weeks after the

PTSM settlement, alleges that Mr. LaClair suffered injuries from

the November 6 incident that were separate and distinct from

those of the November 1 incident.                     This litigation settled on

May 31, 2011.         Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement between the

LaClairs and Suburban, however, the parties agreed to submit to

the district court the question of whether PTSM and Suburban

were    joint      tortfeasors       in   connection      with     the   November    6

incident, or whether those injuries were separate and distinct

such   that     Suburban     alone    would      be   liable.      Pursuant   to    the

Settlement         Agreement,    Suburban        agreed    to    make    an   initial

$650,000 payment to the LaClairs and further agreed to make an

additional payment of $600,000 in the event that the court found

PTSM and Suburban were not joint tortfeasors as to the November

6 incident.

                                            C.

              In    accord   with     the   PTSM      Settlement    Agreement,      the

LaClairs filed a pre-trial motion in the Suburban lawsuit on


                                            8
June 10, 2011, asking for judicial determination that Suburban

was a “successive tortfeasor” and therefore, not entitled to

joint tortfeasor credit for the November 6 incident.                  J.A. 140. 3

That same day, Suburban filed a memorandum explaining why it

should bear joint tortfeasor status with PTSM.

            The district court held a motions hearing on January

20,   2012,    and   decided   that        Suburban   was   indeed     a   joint

tortfeasor with PTSM such that Mrs. LaClair could not recover

additional damages.      The district court explained,

           [T]his was not highly extraordinary.    That this
      kind of thing could well have happened, even if the
      doctors did not see it or had seen it themselves. But
      a reasonable man knowing what they knew at the time
      would conclude that this sort of thing might happen.
      . . . I am persuaded by the fact that if what happens
      is reasonably close to the reason for the initial
      hospitalization, which is what this was, then you
      really do have a kind of a continuous flow here, and
      whatever negligence you have is really part and parcel
      of the initial negligence, too.
           And so I do conclude on these facts that the
      liability of the – the defendant, Suburban Hospital,
      is joined and not independent.

J.A. 771.      The court entered a short, one-page order to this

effect    on   January   24,   2012,        naming    Suburban   as    a   joint

tortfeasor “for reasons stated in the record.”              Id. at 797.       It

is from that order that Mrs. LaClair appeals.

       Solely for purposes of the motion on the causation issue,
Suburban conceded that it was negligent on November 6, 2007, but
it continued to dispute all issues of causation and damages.

           The parties submit that the district court’s order is

reviewed for clear error.          However, this analysis necessarily

involves deciding whether the district court correctly applied

Maryland law, and thus, we approach this appeal “by inspecting

factual findings for clear error and examining de novo the legal

conclusions derived from those facts.”           F.C. Wheat Mar. Corp. v.

United States, 663 F.3d 714, 723 (4th Cir. 2011).             A finding is

clearly erroneous when “although there is evidence to support

it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the

definite   and   firm   conviction        that     a   mistake     has     been

committed.”   Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., 470 U.S.

564, 573 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted).

           Because   this   case    is    in     federal   court   based     on

diversity jurisdiction, the substantive law of the forum state —

in this case, Maryland — applies.              See Erie R.R. v. Tompkins,

304 U.S. 64, 78 (1938).     We should determine:

     how the [Court of Appeals of Maryland] would rule. If
     th[at]   [court]  has  spoken   neither  directly  nor
     indirectly on the particular issue before us, we are
     called upon to predict how that court would rule if
     presented with the issue.   In making that prediction,
     we may consider lower court opinions in [Maryland],
     the teachings of treatises, and the practices in other
     states.

                                         A.

              PTSM will not be jointly liable for the November 6

incident “if it appears highly extraordinary and unforeseeable

that   the    plaintiffs’     injuries     [on       November   6]    occurred   as   a

result of [PTSM’s] alleged tortious conduct.”                    Pittway Corp. v.

Collins, 973 A.2d 771, 788 (Md. 2009).                  Accordingly, PTSM avoids

liability for the November 6 incident “only if the intervening

negligent      act,”    i.e.,   Suburban’s           conduct,   “is    considered     a

superseding cause of the harm to” Mr. LaClair.                       Id. at 789; see

also Morgan v. Cohen, 523 A.2d 1003, 1004-05 (Md. 1987) (“It is

a general rule that a negligent actor is liable not only for

harm that he directly causes but also for any additional harm

resulting from normal efforts of third persons in rendering aid,

irrespective of whether such acts are done in a proper or a

negligent manner.”).

              Maryland courts (and federal district courts sitting

in diversity) have addressed the superseding cause issue with

varying      results.       Pittway   is       the    seminal   Maryland    case      on

superseding      cause,     providing      a     framework      for    analyzing      an

argument that an intervening act cuts off the liability of an

                                         11
original     tortfeasor.        The   Court   of   Appeals     of     Maryland

explained:

     The defendant is liable where the intervening causes,
     acts, or conditions were set in motion by his earlier
     negligence, or naturally induced by such wrongful act
     . . . or even it is generally held, if the intervening
     acts or conditions were of a nature, the happening of
     which was reasonably to have been anticipated[.]

Pittway,     973   A.2d    at   789   (internal    quotation        marks   and

alteration omitted).       Pittway recognizes that Section 442 of the

Restatement (Second) of Torts establishes the test applied in

Maryland courts for analyzing superseding cause:

     The following considerations are of             importance in
     determining   whether  an   intervening          force  is  a
     superseding cause of harm to another:

           (a)   the fact that its intervention brings
           about harm different in kind from that which
           would otherwise have resulted from the
           actor’s negligence;

           (b) the fact that its operation or the
           consequences thereof appear after the event
           to be extraordinary rather than normal in
           view of the circumstances existing at the
           time of its operation;

           (c) the fact that the intervening force is
           operating independently of any situation
           created by the actor’s negligence, or, on
           the other hand, is or is not a normal result
           of such a situation;

           (d) the fact that the operation of the
           intervening force is due to a third person’s
           act or his failure to act;

           (e) the fact that the intervening force is
           due to an act of a third person which is
           wrongful toward the other and as such

                                      12
             subjects   the    third    person      to    liability          to
             him;

             (f) the degree of culpability of a wrongful
             act of a third person which sets the
             intervening force in motion.

Restatement (Second) of Torts § 442 (1965); Pittway, 973 A.2d at

789.

                                        B.

             We conclude that the district court did not err in

finding that Suburban and PTSM were joint tortfeasors.

                                        1.

            The majority of the Restatement Section 442 factors

weigh in favor of a conclusion that Suburban and PTSM were joint

tortfeasors.

                                        a.

            As to factor (a), above, Mrs. LaClair attempts to show

that the injuries sustained on November 6 were “separate and

distinct”     from    those     sustained      on     November         1,     and    thus,

“different in kind.”          See Br. of Appellant 3-9.                 We first note

that   we    would    be   hard-pressed        to     find       a     case       regarding

subsequent    negligent       medical   care     in      which       there    was    not   a

“separate and distinct” injury after the injury caused by the

initial actor’s negligence.             This, alone, does not lead us to

the conclusion that the negligent medical care is a superseding

cause of harm.       See Underwood-Gary v. Mathews, 785 A.2d 708, 713


                                        13
(Md.   2001)       (“[W]hen         a     physician         negligently      treats           the

plaintiff’s        injuries,       the        physician     becomes       liable       to     the

plaintiff to the extent of the harm caused by the physician’s

negligence.         Thus,    the        physician’s        negligent      treatment         is   a

subsequent     tort    for     which          both   the   doctor    and    the     original

tortfeasor are jointly liable.” (internal citations omitted)).

In any event, the harm brought about by the November 6 incident

was not so different from the type of harm that is likely to

result from an 86-year-old man’s fall from a piece of exercise

equipment, even assuming, as Mrs. LaClair would have us do, that

a   severe    spinal        cord        injury       resulted      from    Mr.     LaClair’s

repositioning in his bed.                 For these reasons, factor (a) weighs

in favor of Suburban.

                                                b.

             In addressing factor (b), the Restatement directs us

to look to Restatement (Second) of Torts § 435(2), Comments (c)

and (d).      Comment (c) provides, in part, “Where it appears to

the court in retrospect that it is highly extraordinary that an

intervening cause has come into operation, the court may declare

such a force to be a superseding cause.”                           Restatement (Second)

of Torts § 435(2) cmt. c (1965).                     Comment (d) provides, in part,

“The   court’s      judgment        as    to     whether     the    harm    is     a    highly

extraordinary       result     is       made     after     the   event     with    the       full

knowledge     of    all     that        has    happened.         This     includes          those

                                                14
surroundings of which at the time the actor knew nothing but

which the course of events discloses to the court.”                  Id. cmt. d.

Comment (d) continues:

       [The court] also follows the effects of the actor’s
       negligence as it passes from phase to phase until it
       results in harm to the plaintiff.     In advance, the
       actor may not have any reason to expect that any
       outside force would subsequently operate and change
       the whole course of events from that which it would
       have taken but for its intervention.   None the less,
       the court, knowing that such a force has intervened,
       may   see    nothing extraordinary   either   in  its
       intervention or in the effect which it has upon the
       further development of the injurious results of the
       defendant’s conduct.   This is particularly important
       where the intervening force is supplied by the act of
       a human being . . . , which is itself a reaction to
       the stimulus of a situation for which the actor is
       responsible.

Id.

              Mrs.      LaClair          presents   testimony      from      three

neurosurgeons        that    the    “application      of    [the   patient    care

technicians’] force to the body of an elderly, post-operative

cervical spine patient . . . had never before been witnessed or

known     to     them       in     all     their    years    of    practice      as

Neurosurgeons[.]”           Br. of Appellant 27 (citing J.A. 190, 222,

229).    However, as explained by Comment (d) above, PTSM may have

had no reason to expect that Mr. LaClair would be injured by

being repositioned in his hospital bed, but the proper way to

view    the    situation     is    after-the-fact:     “knowing    that   such   a




                                            15
force has intervened.”           Restatement (Second) Torts § 435 cmt. d

(emphasis added).

              For example, in Henley v. Prince George’s Cnty., the

Court of Appeals of Maryland explained the difference between

foreseeability when considering the existence of a duty and, as

here,       causation:        “Foreseeability       as     a        factor   in     the

determination of the existence of a duty involves a prospective

consideration of the facts existing at the time of the negligent

conduct.        Foreseeability       as    an    element       of   proximate     cause

permits a retrospective consideration of the total facts of the

occurrence[.]”         503 A.2d 1333, 1341 (Md. 1986) (emphases added).

Viewing the facts of this case retrospectively, there is “an

appropriate nexus” between the November 1 incident and injuries

and the November 6 incident and injuries such that it is “at

least   a    permissible       conclusion”       that    Mr.    LaClair’s    already-

injured spine would be further injured by being positioned into

a hospital bed.        Id. at 1342.

              Again,     we     agree     with    the     district       court     that

Suburban’s actions were not “so extraordinary as to bring about

a conclusion of separate intervening cause.”                        J.A. 766.     Thus,

factor (b) also weighs in favor of Suburban.




                                          16
                                      c.

            Considering     the     cross-referencing        set    forth    in

Restatement (Second) Section 442, factors (c), (e), and (f) 4 boil

down to the same core inquiries:               whether Suburban’s actions

were “a normal consequence of a situation created by the actor’s

negligent     conduct,” 5   and    whether    the   manner    in   which    the

intervening     act   was   done     was     “extraordinarily      negligent.”

Restatement (Second) Torts §§ 443, 447(c) (1965).

            First, clearly, Mr. LaClair would not have sustained

the injuries on November 6 if PTSM’s negligence had not put him

in the hospital in the first place. 6               And the district court



     4
       As to factor (d), the district court dismissed this factor
as irrelevant to the inquiry, but it only appeared to analyze
the “failure to act” portion of § 442(d).       See J.A. 767-68.
While this may have been legal error, even assuming factor (d)
weighs in favor of Mrs. LaClair, the balance of the factors
nonetheless weighs in favor of Suburban.
     5
       The comments to factor (c) explain that the “situation
created by the actor’s negligence” means any situation that the
original tortfeasor’s actions were a substantial factor in
bringing about.   See Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 447(c),
442(c) cmt. d.
     6
       Indeed, the LaClairs themselves believed the November 6
incident to be a foreseeable consequence of the November 1
incident.   They recognized as much in their initial complaint
against PTSM, which sought to hold PTSM liable for “two surgical
procedures” at Suburban.      J.A. 48 (emphasis added).       In
addition,   on   July    12,   2009,   the   LaClairs   answered
interrogatories and listed the following as caused by the PTSM’s
negligence: admission to Suburban from November 1 to November
13, 2007; admission to the rehabilitation center from November
13 to November 30; admission to Georgetown University for

                                      17
found, “the act, . . . the putting back in bed is not itself

extraordinary.”            J.A.   767.        Mrs.        LaClair’s      attorney

agreed.     See id. at 709 (The Court: “[T]he objective anyway was

to put this man back in bed.        That’s not unforeseeable; correct?

Mr. Regan:      Yes.”).     The district court did not err in finding

that it is a “normal consequence,” (i.e., foreseeable) that a

cervical spine patient might sustain additional spinal injuries

at the hands of medical professionals.

            As to the manner in which the negligent act was done,

we should consider the injuries and the degree of culpability of

the   patient     care    technicians.      Even     if    the     patient     care

technicians were “very rough,” J.A. 362, that does not quite get

us to the level of “extraordinarily negligent.”                       Restatement

(Second) of Torts § 447(c).         Indeed, Maryland courts have held

that original tortfeasors are liable for more significant harm

inflicted          by         intervening            negligent            medical

professionals.       See    Underwood-Gary,   785     A.2d    at   713       (“[An]

original tortfeasor is liable for additional harm caused by a

treating     physician’s      improper      diagnosis        and     unnecessary

surgery[.]      This rule is based on the premise that the negligent

actor, by his or her conduct, has placed the plaintiff in a



surgery from February 5 to February 25, 2008; and home nursing
care from April 2008 to July 2009. See id. at 64-78.

position of danger and should answer for the risks inherent in

treatment and rendering aid.” (citing Restatement (Second) of

Torts § 457 cmt. c, illus. 1)); Richards v. Freeman, 179 F.

Supp. 2d 556, 560-61 (D. Md. 2002) (where physicians negligently

performed surgeries that left car accident victim with a right

arterial    tear    in    her        heart,   finding      physicians    and    original

defendant    driver       to    be     “joint”     yet    “subsequent    tortfeasors”

under    Maryland’s       Uniform       Contribution        Among   Tort-Feasors      Act

(UCATA)); see also Morgan, 523 A.2d at 1008 (stating that under

the UCATA, an original tortfeasor and a negligent health care

provider could be considered concurrent tortfeasors concurring

in producing the additional harm).

            Kyte v. McMillion, 259 A.2d 532 (Md. 1969), cited by

Mrs. LaClair, does not change this result.                       There, a young woman

was involved in a car wreck due to a negligent driver, and she

was taken to the hospital and treated for broken bones.                               Upon

admission     to    the        hospital,       a   physician        ordered    a   blood

transfusion,        but        the     nurse       used     the     wrong      type    of

blood.      See id. at 533.               As a result of this mistake, the

plaintiff suffered “bleak prospects of future pregnancies” and

was     projected    to        have    “difficult         gestation    from    both    an

emotional and physical point of view.”                     Id.    The plaintiff filed

suit     against    the        hospital       first,      ultimately     reaching      an

agreement and signing a release as to damages stemming only from

                                              19
the blood transfusion.               See id. at 533-34.             Later, when the

plaintiff   filed     suit        against   the     allegedly     negligent     driver,

McMillion, the court held that McMillion was not included in the

release and thus, the damages awarded to the plaintiff from the

hospital should not be credited to McMillion.                     Id. at 543.

            Notably,        the    Maryland       Court    of   Special    Appeals   has

limited this case to its facts as “the Court [in Kyte] was

careful    to    point      out    that     the    injuries      [broken     bones   and

inability       to   have     children]       were        peculiarly      separate   and

divisible[.]”        Sullivan v. Miller, 337 A.2d 185, 191 (Md. Ct.

Spec. App. 1975).            Even the Kyte court itself declared, “It

should be understood . . . that the decision announced herein

goes no further than the unusual facts and circumstances of this

case.”    See Kyte, 259 A.2d at 543. 7

            Therefore, we cannot say that the negligence of the

patient care technicians, either in manner or consequence, was




     7
       In this appeal, Suburban also contends that the settlement
with PTSM already took into account the damages arising from the
November 6 incident, and points to the LaClairs’ answers to
interrogatories on July 12, 2009, in the PTSM lawsuit. See
supra, note 7.     However, while this argument may have some
merit, we do not rely on it because it appears that the LaClairs
shifted gears in the middle of their litigation with PTSM (and
after the interrogatory answers were filed) due to the testimony
of Dr. Powers. Moreover, reliance on this basis is unnecessary
given the weight of other factors in favor of Suburban.

weigh in favor of Suburban.

            Examining the Restatement Section 442 factors does not

end   our   inquiry.          The    Court    of     Appeals    of   Maryland     further

explains that Section 447 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts

illuminates these factors:

        “The fact that an intervening act of a third person is
        negligent in itself or is done in a negligent manner
        does not make it a superseding cause of harm to
        another which the actor’s negligent conduct is a
        substantial factor in bringing about, if

            (a) the actor at the time of his negligent
            conduct should have realized that a third
            person might so act, or

            (b) a reasonable man knowing the situation
            existing when the act of the third person
            was done would not regard it as highly
            extraordinary that the third person had so
            acted, or

            (c)   the  intervening   act   is  a   normal
            consequence of a situation created by the
            actor’s conduct and the manner in which it
            is done is not extraordinarily negligent.”

Pittway, 973 A.2d at 789 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts

§   447).       Thus,    “a     superseding        cause   arises       primarily       when

unusual and extraordinary independent intervening negligent acts

occur    that    could    not       have   been    anticipated       by   the    original

tortfeasor.”             Id.        (internal        quotation       marks       omitted).

Therefore, courts should look to both the foreseeability of the


                                             21
harm suffered by the plaintiff, as well as the foreseeability of

the intervening act itself.          See id. at 792.

            Any   doubt     that    the    Restatement     Section   442    factors

weigh in favor of Suburban is resolved by an analysis of Section

447:   PTSM should have realized that an elderly man injured by a

fall from its own exercise equipment would have to go to the

hospital,    would      receive      medical       care,    and   may      possibly

experience negligent medical care there.               Mr. LaClair’s ultimate

injuries    and   the      manner    in    which    they    occurred    were    not

extraordinary,       nor      were        these    unfortunate       consequences

unforeseeable.

                                          IV.

            For   the      foregoing       reasons,   the    judgment      of   the

district court is

                                                                        AFFIRMED.

                     MARY BUI, Petitioner v.
          COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, Respondent



      Docket No. 20453-16.                       Filed May 21, 2019.


      Ronda N. Edgar, for petitioner.

      Adam B. Landy, Nancy M. Gilmore, and Thomas R. Mackinson, for

respondent.



              MEMORANDUM FINDINGS OF FACT AND OPINION


      GOEKE, Judge: Respondent issued a notice of deficiency to petitioner

determining an income tax deficiency for 2011 of $173,058 and an addition to tax
                                            -2-

[*2] under section 6651(a)(1) of $66,668.1 After concessions, the sole issue

remaining for consideration is whether petitioner must include in gross income

cancellation of indebtedness of $355,488. We hold that she may properly exclude

$48,151 but must include the remaining $307,337.

                                FINDINGS OF FACT

      This case was tried on September 10, 2018, in San Francisco, California.

The parties have submitted a stipulation of facts and accompanying exhibits,

which are incorporated herein by this reference. When the petition was timely

filed, petitioner resided in California.2

      Petitioner is also known as Nga Thuy Lan Bui. For 2011 petitioner

excluded $355,488 of discharged indebtedness from her gross income and

indicated the excluded indebtedness was qualified principal residence

       Unless otherwise indicated, all section references are to the Internal
Revenue Code (Code) as amended and in effect at all relevant times, and all Rule
references are to the Tax Court Rules of Practice and Procedure.
      2
       The petition was received with an illegible postmark on September 19,
2016, five days after the time to file a petition with this Court had expired. Sec.
301.7502-1(c)(1)(iii)(A), Proced. & Admin. Regs., places on the taxpayer the
burden to prove the date an illegible postmark was made. On March 12, 2019, we
issued an order directing petitioner to sustain her burden of establishing that the
postmark was timely made. On March 24, 2019, petitioner responded to our order
and supplemented the record with proof of mailing on September 12, 2016.
Accordingly, we are satisfied of our jurisdiction to hear this case.

[*3] indebtedness. On June 16, 2016, respondent issued a notice of deficiency to

petitioner for 2011 and proposed an adjustment disallowing her entire exclusion of

discharged indebtedness income. Respondent now concedes that petitioner was

insolvent by $42,852 in 2011.

I.    Residences

      A.    Red River Property

      On June 1, 1981, petitioner, her former spouse, and three other persons

purchased a single-family residence on Red River Way in San Jose, California

(Red River property), for $156,500. Petitioner and her former spouse together

owned a 25% interest in the Red River property. By grant deed dated October 15,

1985, and recorded January 28, 1986, petitioner and her former spouse purchased

the remaining 75% interest in the Red River property for $97,500. By quitclaim

deed dated November 14, 2002, and recorded December 12, 2002, petitioner

acquired sole ownership in the Red River property. Petitioner legally separated

from her former spouse in 2005 or 2006.

      Petitioner lived at the Red River property from its acquisition in 1981

through March 14, 2011, and treated it as her primary residence. On March 14,

2011, petitioner relinquished ownership of the Red River property by short sale for
                                       -4-

[*4] $485,000. At that time, the balance of the mortgage on the Red River

property was $416,000.

      B.    Cedar Grove Property

      On or around June 1, 1988, petitioner and her former spouse purchased a

single-family rental home on Cedar Grove Circle in San Jose, California (Cedar

Grove property). By quitclaim deed dated November 14, 2002, and recorded

December 12, 2002, petitioner acquired sole ownership in the Cedar Grove

property. After petitioner sold the Red River property in March 2011, she moved

into the Cedar Grove property and established it as her new primary residence.

II.   Wells Fargo Lines of Credit

      Before 2011 petitioner obtained three home equity lines of credit with Wells

Fargo Bank, N.A. (Wells Fargo). Petitioner executed a deed of trust dated

February 14, 2007, and recorded March 12, 2007, securing a $250,000 line of

credit for an account ending in 9471 between herself and Wells Fargo with the

Red River property listed as collateral (9471 loan). Petitioner executed a deed of

trust dated March 1, 2007, and recorded March 26, 2007, securing a $40,000 line

of credit for an account ending in 7231 between herself and Wells Fargo with the

Cedar Grove property as collateral (7231 loan). Petitioner also executed a deed of

trust dated March 20, 2007, and recorded April 30, 2007, securing a $101,942 line
                                        -5-

[*5] of credit for an account ending in 5371 between herself and Wells Fargo with

the Cedar Grove property as collateral (5371 loan).

      In 2011 Wells Fargo issued three Forms 1099-C, Cancellation of Debt, to

petitioner indicating that the remaining debt associated with the 9471 loan, the

7231 loan, and the 5371 loan had been canceled. On the Forms 1099-C Wells

Fargo described the debts as “HEQ Secured Installment Loan” and checked the

box indicating petitioner was personally liable for repayment of the debts.

Petitioner’s canceled Wells Fargo debt for 2011 was as follows:

 Date of Form 1099-C        Amount of canceled debt             Account No.
     Mar. 18, 2011                  $243,299                        9471
     Oct. 28, 2011                    11,999                        7231
     Oct. 28, 2011                   100,190                        5371

      Petitioner executed at least four additional deeds of trust with Wells Fargo

before 2011. In addition, petitioner, with and without her former spouse, executed

at least seven deeds of trust between 1986 and 2004 from banking institutions

other than Wells Fargo. The indebtedness indicated by these additional deeds of

trust was not canceled in 2011.
                                       -6-

[*6] III.    Home Improvements

       Petitioner testified to carrying out a number of home improvement projects

before 2011 for the Red River property, but she provided no documentation

relating to when or how expenses of these projects were paid. She did not testify

to any home improvement project expenses related to the Cedar Grove property.

Petitioner paid approximately $10,000 for custom drapes to be installed at the Red

River property in 2007. In addition, she spent approximately $12,000 for

driveway repair and expansion work at the Red River property in 2008. The

remaining home improvement expenditures petitioner testified to were made

before 2007, the year she obtained the Wells Fargo lines of credit. The associated

debts were discharged in 2011.

                                    OPINION

       Generally, the Commissioner’s determinations in a notice of deficiency are

presumed correct, and the taxpayer bears the burden of proving the determinations

are erroneous. Rule 142(a); Welch v. Helvering, 290 U.S. 111, 115 (1933).

However, for the presumption of correctness to attach in an unreported income

case such as this, the Commissioner must base his deficiency determination on

some substantive evidence that the taxpayer received unreported income. Hardy v.

Commissioner, 181 F.3d 1002, 1004 (9th Cir. 1999), aff’g T.C. Memo. 1997-97.
                                        -7-

[*7] There is no dispute in this case that petitioner had debt that was forgiven.

Section 7491(a) shifts the burden of proof to the Commissioner where the taxpayer

has presented credible evidence with respect to any factual issue relevant to

ascertaining the correct tax liability of the taxpayer. Section 7491(a) also requires

that the taxpayer have substantiated all appropriate items, maintained records as

required under the Code, and cooperated with all reasonable requests by the

Commissioner for witnesses, information, documents, meetings, and interviews.

Sec. 7491(a)(2)(A) and (B). Petitioner has not attempted to argue, and the record

does not demonstrate, her compliance with the requirements of section 7491(a);

accordingly, the burden remains with petitioner to show respondent’s

determinations were incorrect.

      This is a dispute over whether petitioner had reportable cancellation of

indebtedness income that she failed to report on her 2011 tax return. The Code

defines income liberally as “all income from whatever source derived”. Sec.

61(a). Specifically, income includes any income from the discharge of

indebtedness. Sec. 61(a)(12); sec. 1.61-12(a), Income Tax Regs. The underlying

rationale for the inclusion of canceled debt as income is that the release from a

debt obligation the taxpayer would otherwise have to pay frees up assets
                                        -8-

[*8] previously offset by the obligation and acts as an accession to wealth--i.e.,

income. United States v. Kirby Lumber Co., 284 U.S. 1, 2 (1931).

      Generally, when canceled debt creates income, the amount includible in

income is equal to the face value of the discharged obligation minus any amount

paid in satisfaction of the debt. Rios v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2012-128,

2012 WL 1537910, at *4, aff’d, 586 F. App’x 268 (9th Cir. 2014); see Merkel v.

Commissioner, 192 F.3d 844, 849 (9th Cir. 1999), aff’g 109 T.C. 463 (1997). The

income is recognized for the year in which the debt is canceled. Montgomery v.

Commissioner, 65 T.C. 511, 520 (1975).

      Petitioner argues that although the cancellation of debt generally creates

reportable income her canceled debt is excludable. Some “accessions to wealth

that would ordinarily constitute income may be excluded by statute or other

operation of law.” Commissioner v. Dunkin, 500 F.3d 1065, 1069 (9th Cir. 2007),

rev’g 124 T.C. 180 (2005). Even so, “given the clear Congressional intent to

‘exert * * * the full measure of its taxing power,’ * * * exclusions from gross

income are construed narrowly in favor of taxation.” Id. (quoting Commissioner

v. Glenshaw Glass Co., 348 U.S. 426, 429 (1955)) (citing Merkel v. Commissioner

192 F.3d at 848). Petitioner argues two exclusions apply to her cancellation of

indebtedness income: section 108(a)(1)(E), which offers an exclusion when the
                                        -9-

[*9] canceled debt is “qualified principal residence indebtedness”; and section

108(a)(1)(B), which provides an exclusion where the taxpayer is insolvent. We

will examine both exclusions as applied to petitioner.

I.    Qualified Principal Residence Indebtedness

      Section 108(a)(1)(E) provides that gross income does not include amounts

which would be includible as cancellation of indebtedness income if “the

indebtedness discharged is qualified principal residence indebtedness”. Qualified

principal residence indebtedness is defined as (1) acquisition indebtedness

(2) with respect to the taxpayer’s principal residence. Sec. 108(h)(2), (5).

Acquisition indebtedness is “incurred in acquiring, constructing, or substantially

improving any qualified residence of the taxpayer” and must be secured by that

residence. Sec. 163(h)(3)(B)(i). If only a portion of a discharged loan obligation

meets the definition of qualified principal residence indebtedness, only the amount

discharged which exceeds the nonqualified principal residence indebtedness is

excludable. Sec. 108(h)(4).

      Petitioner’s primary residence was the Red River property until she sold it

in March 2011 and established the Cedar Grove property as her new primary

residence. Three of her Wells Fargo lines of credit--the 9471 loan, the 7231 loan,

and the 5371 loan--were canceled in 2011. Petitioner does not argue that any of
                                       - 10 -

[*10] these loans, which were obtained in 2007, were used to acquire or construct

either the Red River property or the Cedar Grove property, both of which were

solely acquired by petitioner in 2002. Petitioner instead argues that funds from

these loans were used to substantially improve her primary residence.

      Petitioner provided no evidence regarding substantial improvements made

to the Cedar Grove property. For the qualified principal residence indebtedness

exclusion to apply, the debt must be used to acquire, construct, or substantially

improve the taxpayer’s primary residence, and that residence must secure the loan.

See secs. 108(h)(2), 163(h)(3)(B)(i). Both the 7231 loan and the 5371 loan were

secured by the Cedar Grove property. Therefore, because these loans were not

used to acquire, construct, or substantially improve the Cedar Grove property, they

are not excludable from gross income as qualified principal residence

indebtedness.

      Petitioner offered testimony on a number of improvements made to the Red

River property before she obtained the 9471 loan. These improvements could not

have been financed by a loan that had not materialized at the time they were made.

Thus, they will be disregarded for purposes of determining whether any portion of

the 9471 loan was qualified personal residence indebtedness. Petitioner spent

$12,000 on driveway expansion and repair work at the Red River property in
                                        - 11 -

[*11] 2008. We are satisfied from her testimony that this amount was paid with

the 9471 loan. Accordingly, the portion of the 9471 loan that was used to finance

the driveway project is qualified principal residence indebtedness. Petitioner also

testified that she had custom drapes installed at the Red River property in 2007 for

$10,000. We do not find that this expense constitutes a substantial improvement

to the Red River property, and therefore it is not qualified principal residence

indebtedness.

      We have determined that $12,000 of the 9471 loan was qualified principal

residence indebtedness; however, the amount that petitioner may properly exclude

is limited by section 108(h)(4). Section 108(h)(4) provides that where only a

portion of a discharged loan is qualified principal residence indebtedness, the

amount that may be excluded is only “so much of the amount discharged as

exceeds the amount of the loan (as determined immediately before such discharge)

which is not qualified principal residence indebtedness.” To apply this limitation

we must determine how much of the loan was not qualified principal residence

indebtedness. The original line of credit was for $250,000. We have determined

that $12,000 was qualified principal residence indebtedness; thus $238,000 was

not qualified principal residence indebtedness. Therefore, petitioner may exclude

only $5,299 of the canceled 9471 loan from her income under the qualified
                                       - 12 -

[*12] principal residence indebtedness exclusion ($243,299 canceled debt minus

the $238,000 of the debt that was not qualified principal residence indebtedness).

II.   Insolvency Exclusion

      Petitioner argues that even if her cancellation of indebtedness income is not

excludable as qualified principal residence indebtedness, it should be excludable

because she was insolvent in 2011. Section 108(a)(1)(B) provides an exclusion

from gross income of cancellation of indebtedness amounts where the taxpayer is

insolvent at the time the discharge occurs. A taxpayer is insolvent by the amount

her liabilities exceed the fair market value of her assets, determined immediately

before the discharge of indebtedness. Sec. 108(d)(3).

      Respondent concedes that petitioner was insolvent by $42,852 and,

therefore, admits that amount of cancellation of indebtedness income is

excludable. In the case of a taxpayer who qualifies for the insolvency exclusion,

the excluded amount cannot exceed the amount by which the taxpayer is insolvent.

Sec. 108(a)(3). Petitioner suggests that respondent did not accurately account for

her assets and liabilities when calculating her insolvency. However, petitioner

stipulated respondent’s insolvency calculations and has offered no coherent

argument as to why the calculations are in error. Accordingly, petitioner is

entitled to an insolvency exclusion for her cancellation of indebtedness income of
                                        - 13 -

[*13] $42,852. Petitioner may exclude a total of $48,151--representing $42,852

under the insolvency exclusion and $5,299 under the qualified principal residence

indebtedness exclusion--of her cancellation of indebtedness income from her gross

income.3

         In reaching our holding, we have considered all arguments made, and, to the

extent not mentioned above, we conclude they are moot, irrelevant, or without

merit.


                                                      Decision will be entered under

                                                 Rule 155.




         3
        Sec. 108(a)(2)(C) provides that the insolvency exclusion does not apply to
any discharge to which the qualified principal residence indebtedness exclusion
applies unless the taxpayer elects the insolvency exclusion to apply in lieu of the
qualified principal residence indebtedness exclusion. Petitioner made no such
election; however, because three debts were discharged we may apply the
insolvency exclusion to the loans not eligible for the qualified principal residence
exclusion.

Harsha, J.
        {¶1}    Jerone McDougald appeals the judgment denying his fifth petition for

postconviction relief and his motion for leave to file a motion for new trial. McDougald

contends that the court erred in denying his petition, which raised claims of ineffective

assistance of his trial counsel. He additionally argues that the court erred in denying his

motion for leave to file a motion for new trial, but did not assign any errors regarding this

decision.

        {¶2}    We reject McDougald’s claims. He failed to demonstrate the requirements

necessary for the trial court to address the merits of his untimely claims in his fifth

petition for postconviction relief. Moreover, res judicata barred this successive petition

because he could have raised these claims on direct appeal or in one of his earlier

postconviction petitions. Finally, because he failed to assign any error regarding the

trial court’s denial of his motion for leave to file a motion for new trial, we need not

address his arguments regarding that decision.

                                              I. FACTS1

        {¶4}    Authorities searched a premises in Portsmouth and found crack cocaine,

money, digital scales, and a pistol. They arrested the two occupants of the residence,

McDougald and Kendra White, at the scene. Subsequently, the Scioto County Grand

Jury returned an indictment charging McDougald with drug possession, drug trafficking,

possession of criminal tools, and the possession of a firearm while under disability.

McDougald pleaded not guilty to all charges.

        {¶5}    At the jury trial Kendra White testified that McDougald used her home to

sell crack cocaine and that she sold drugs on his behalf as well. She also testified that

the digital scales belonged to McDougald and, although the pistol belonged to her ex-

boyfriend, Benny Simpson (who was then incarcerated), McDougald asked her to bring

it inside the home so that he would feel more secure. White explained that Simpson

previously used the pistol to shoot at her, but threw it somewhere in the backyard when

he left. Simpson then allegedly called White from jail and instructed her to retrieve the

pistol. White complied and then hid it “under the tool shed” until McDougald instructed

her to retrieve it and bring it inside the house. White confirmed that she saw

McDougald at the premises with the gun on his person.

        {¶6}    Jesse Dixon and Melinda Elrod both testified that they purchased crack

cocaine from McDougald at the residence. Shawna Lattimore testified that she served

Scioto Nos. 14CA3649 and 15CA3679, 2015-Ohio-5590, appeal not accepted for review, State v.

as a “middleman” for McDougald's drug operation and also helped him transport drugs

from Dayton. She testified that she also saw McDougald carry the pistol.

       {¶7}       The jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts. The trial court sentenced

McDougald to serve five years on the possession count, nine years for trafficking, one

year for the possession of criminal tools, and five years for the possession of a firearm

while under disability. The court ordered the sentences to be served consecutively for a

total of twenty years imprisonment. The sentences were included in a judgment entry

filed April 30, 2007, as well as a nunc pro tunc judgment entry filed May 16, 2007.

       {¶8}       In McDougald's direct appeal, where he was represented by different

counsel than his trial attorney, we affirmed his convictions and sentence. State v.

McDougald, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 07CA3157, 2008-Ohio-1398. We rejected

McDougald's contention that because the only evidence to link him to the crimes was

“the testimony of admitted drug addicts and felons,” the verdicts were against the

manifest weight of the evidence:

       * * * appellant's trial counsel skillfully cross-examined the prosecution's
       witnesses as to their statuses as drug addicts and convicted felons.
       Counsel also drew attention to the fact that some of the witnesses may
       actually benefit from the testimony that they gave. That evidence
       notwithstanding, the jury obviously chose to believe the prosecution's
       version of the events. Because the jury was in a better position to view
       those witnesses and determine witness credibility, we will not second-
       guess them on these issues.


Id. at ¶ 8, 10.
       {¶9}       In January 2009, McDougald filed his first petition for postconviction relief.

He claimed that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation when the

trial court admitted a drug laboratory analysis report into evidence over his objection.
Scioto App. No. 16CA3736                                                               4

The trial court denied the petition, and we affirmed the trial court's judgment. State v.

McDougald, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 09CA3278, 2009-Ohio-4417.

          {¶10} In October 2009, McDougald filed his second petition for postconviction

relief. He again claimed that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation

when the trial court admitted the drug laboratory analysis report. The trial court denied

the petition, and McDougald did not appeal the judgment.

          {¶11} In July 2014, McDougald filed his third petition for postconviction relief.

He claimed that: (1) the trial court lacked jurisdiction to convict and sentence him

because the original complaint filed in the Portsmouth Municipal Court was based on

false statements sworn to by the officers; (2) the prosecuting attorney knowingly used

and relied on false and perjured testimony in procuring the convictions against him; and

(3) the state denied him his right to due process by withholding exculpatory evidence,

i.e., a drug task force report. McDougald attached the report, the municipal court

complaints, a portion of the trial transcript testimony of Kendra White, his request for

discovery, and the state's answer to his request for discovery to his petition. The trial

court denied the petition because it was untimely and did not fall within an exception

justifying its late filing. McDougald appealed from the trial court's judgment denying his

third petition for postconviction relief.

          {¶12} In December 2014, McDougald filed his fourth petition for postconviction

relief. He claimed that his sentence is void because the trial court never properly

entered a final order in his criminal case. The trial court denied the petition. McDougald

appealed from the trial court's judgment denying his fourth petition for postconviction

relief.
Scioto App. No. 16CA3736                                                                 5


       {¶13} We consolidated the appeals and affirmed the judgments of the trial court

denying his third and fourth petitions for postconviction relief. McDougald, 2015-Ohio-

5590. We held that McDougald failed to establish the requirements necessary for the

trial court to address the merits of his untimely claims and that res judicata barred the

claims because he either raised them on direct appeal or could have raised them on

direct appeal or in one of his previous petitions for postconviction relief. Id.

       {¶14} In November 2015, over eight and one-half years after he was sentenced,

McDougald filed his fifth petition for postconviction relief. He argued that his trial

counsel had provided ineffective assistance by failing to conduct an independent

investigation of various matters, failing to use preliminary hearing testimony of the

arresting officer to impeach the state’s case, failing to emphasize Kendra White’s prior

statements to the police to impeach her testimony, failing to object to the arresting

officer’s testimony that the firearm found at the scene was operable and had a clip and

bullets, and failing to counter the state’s response to his objection concerning testimony

about an Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (“BCI”) report with evidence that the BCI

employee had been timely subpoenaed.

       {¶15} In December 2015, McDougald filed a motion for leave to file a motion for

new trial. He claimed that the state withheld a drug task force report that contained

strong exculpatory evidence and that the report proved that the state presented false

and perjured testimony at trial.

       {¶16} After the state responded, the trial court denied the petition and the

motion, and this appeal ensued.

                              II. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR
Scioto App. No. 16CA3736                                                            6


       {¶17} McDougald assigns the following errors for our review:

       1. Defendant was prejudiced by trial counsel’s failure to conduct
       independent investigation to rebut state’s theory of prior acts of the
       defendant or ask for a mistrial prejudicing defendant’s trial.

       2. Defendant was prejudiced by trial counsel’s failure to conduct
       independ[e]nt investigation and failed to present that the prosecutor
       knowingly used false and fabricated testimony concerning the gun in
       violation of defendant[’]s due process prejudicing defendant[’]s trial.

       3. Defendant was prejudiced by trial counsel[’]s failure to conduct
       independent investigation and failed to present that the state knowingly
       used false and fabricated evidence in violation of defendant’s due process
       rights and prejudicing defendant’s trial.

       4. Defendant was prejudiced by trial counsel’s failure to conduct
       independent investigation and failed to present that the arresting officer[’]s
       conduct in admitting and establishing the op[]erability of the f[i]rearm
       violat[ed] defendant’s due process rights and also evidence [rule] 702-703.

       5. Defendant was prejudiced by trial counsel’s failure to raise that BCI tech
       was subpoenaed within the 7 day requirement pursuant to R.C.
       2925.51(C) prejudicing defendant’s 6th amendment rights to confrontation.
       Trial attorney was ineffective in this regard.

                                III. STANDARD OF REVIEW

       {¶18} McDougald’s assignments of error contest the trial court’s denial of his fifth

petition for postconviction relief.

       {¶19} The postconviction relief process is a collateral civil attack on a criminal

judgment rather than an appeal of the judgment. State v. Calhoun, 86 Ohio St.3d 279,

281, 714 N.E.2d 905 (1999). Postconviction relief is not a constitutional right; instead, it

is a narrow remedy that gives the petitioner no more rights than those granted by

statute. Id. It is a means to resolve constitutional claims that cannot be addressed on

direct appeal because the evidence supporting the claims is not contained in the record.

State v. Knauff, 4th Dist. Adams No. 13CA976, 2014-Ohio-308, ¶ 18.
Scioto App. No. 16CA3736                                                               7


        {¶20} “[A] trial court's decision granting or denying a postconviction relief petition

filed pursuant to R.C. 2953.21 should be upheld absent an abuse of discretion; a

reviewing court should not overrule the trial court's finding on a petition for

postconviction relief that is supported by competent and credible evidence.” State v.

Gondor, 112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, 860 N.E.2d 77, ¶ 58. A trial court abuses

its discretion when its decision is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. In re H.

V., 138 Ohio St.3d 408, 2014-Ohio-812, 7 N.E.3d 1173, ¶ 8.

                                  IV. LAW AND ANALYSIS

                           A. Fifth Petition for Postconviction Relief

        {¶21} In his five assignments of error McDougald asserts that his trial counsel

was ineffective for failing to investigate his case and failing to take certain actions during

his jury trial.

        {¶22} R.C. 2953.21(A)(2) provides that a petition for postconviction relief must

be filed “no later than three hundred sixty-five days after the expiration of the time for

filing the appeal.” McDougald’s fifth petition for postconviction relief was filed over eight

years after the expiration of time for filing an appeal from his convictions and sentence

so it was untimely. See, e.g., State v. Heid, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 15CA3710, 2016-Ohio-

2756, ¶ 15.

        {¶23} R.C. 2953.23(A)(1) authorizes a trial court to address the merits of an

untimely filed petition for postconviction relief only if: (1) the petitioner shows either that

he was unavoidably prevented from discovery of the facts upon which he must rely to

present the claim for relief or that the United States Supreme Court recognized a new

federal or state right that applies retroactively to him; and (2) the petitioner shows by
Scioto App. No. 16CA3736                                                             8


clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found him guilty

but for constitutional error at trial.

       {¶24} McDougald does not contend that the United States Supreme Court

recognized a new right that applied retroactively to him, so he had to prove that he was

unavoidably prevented from the discovery of the facts upon which he relied to present

his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. “A defendant is ‘unavoidably prevented’

from the discovery of facts if he had no knowledge of the existence of those facts and

could not have, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, learned of their existence within

the time specified for filing his petition for postconviction relief.” State v. Cunningham,

3d Dist. Allen No. 1-15-61, 2016-Ohio-3106, ¶ 19, citing State v. Holnapy, 11th Dist.

Lake No. 2013-L-002, 2013-Ohio-4307, ¶ 32, and State v. Roark, 10th Dist. Franklin No.

15AP-142, 2015-Ohio-3206, ¶ 11.

       {¶25} The only “new” evidence cited by McDougald in his petition for

postconviction relief consisted of an excerpt from the arresting officer’s preliminary

hearing testimony, a subpoena issued to a BCI employee, and a CD of Kendra White’s

police interview following her arrest. He does not explain how either he or his appellate

counsel were unavoidably prevented from having access to this evidence at the time he

filed his direct appeal. Nor does he indicate how he was unavoidably prevented from

discovering them before he filed any of his previous four petitions for postconviction

relief. “Moreover, ‘[t]he fact that appellant raises claims of ineffective assistance of

counsel suggests that the bases for his claims could have been uncovered if

“reasonable diligence” had been exercised.’ ” Cunningham, 2016-Ohio-3106, at ¶ 22,

quoting State v. Creech, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 12CA3500, 2013-Ohio-3791, ¶ 18.
Scioto App. No. 16CA3736                                                             9


Therefore, McDougald did not establish that the trial court possessed the authority to

address the merits of his untimely fifth petition for postconviction relief.

       {¶26} Furthermore, res judicata barred his successive petition because he could

have raised his claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal, when

he was represented by different counsel, or in one of his earlier petitions for

postconviction relief. See State v. Griffin, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 14CA010680, 2016-Ohio-

2988, ¶ 12, citing State v. Cole, 2 Ohio St.3d 112 (1982), syllabus (“When the issue of

competent trial counsel could have been determined on direct appeal without resort to

evidence outside the record, res judicata is a proper basis to dismiss a petition for

postconviction relief”); Heid, 2016-Ohio-2756, at ¶ 18 (res judicata barred petitioner

from raising ineffective-assistance claim that he raised or could have raised in prior

petitions for postconviction relief); State v. Edwards, 4th Dist. Ross No. 14CA3474,

2015-Ohio-3039, ¶ 10 (“claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel are barred from

being raised on postconviction relief by the doctrine of res judicata”). This is not a case

where the exception to the general rule of res judicata applies, i.e., this is not a case

where the defendant was represented by the same counsel at both the trial and on

direct appeal. See State v. Ulmer, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 15CA3708, 2016-Ohio-2873, ¶

15.

       {¶27} Therefore, the trial court did not act in an unreasonable, arbitrary, or

unconscionable manner by denying McDougald’s fifth petition for postconviction relief.

We overrule his assignments of error.

                       B. Motion for Leave to File Motion for New Trial
Scioto App. No. 16CA3736                                                               10


       {¶28} McDougald also argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion for

leave to file a motion for new trial. But he failed to assign any error regarding the court’s

decision, and we thus need not address his arguments. See State v. Owens, 2016-

Ohio-176, __ N.E.3d __, ¶ 59 (4th Dist.), quoting State v. Nguyen, 4th Dist. Athens No.

14CA42, 2015–Ohio–4414, ¶ 41 (“ ‘we need not address this contention because we

review assignments of error and not mere arguments’ ”).

       {¶29} In addition, even if we exercised our discretion and treated McDougald’s

“issues presented for review” as assignments of error, they would lack merit. The trial

court did not abuse its considerable discretion by denying McDougald’s motion, which

was based on his claim that the state withheld a drug task force report. McDougald did

not establish by clear and convincing evidence that he was unavoidably prevented from

discovering the report long before he filed his motion for leave over eight years after the

verdict in his jury trial. See State v. N.D.C., 10th Dist. Franklin No. 15AP-63, 2015-

Ohio-3643, ¶ 13. Moreover, we held in McDougald’s appeal from the denial of his

fourth and fifth petitions for postconviction relief that the drug task force report did not

establish that the state’s case was false because “[t]he report would merely have been

cumulative to the other evidence admitted at trial” and it “did not constitute material,

exculpatory evidence that the state improperly withheld from McDougald.” McDougald,

2015-Ohio-5590, at ¶ 24.

                                      V. CONCLUSION

       {¶30} Having overruled McDougald’s assignments of error, we affirm the

judgment of the trial court.

                                                                    JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

723 P.2d 394 (1986)
L. Lynn ALLEN and Merle Allen, Plaintiffs and Respondents,
v.
Thomas M. KINGDON and Joan O. Kingdon, Defendants and Appellants.
No. 18290.
Supreme Court of Utah.
July 29, 1986.
H. James Clegg, Scott Daniels, Salt Lake City, for defendants and appellants.
Boyd M. Fullmer, Salt Lake City, for plaintiffs and respondents.
HOWE, Justice:
The plaintiffs Allen (buyers) brought this action for the return of all money they had paid on an earnest money agreement to purchase residential real estate. The defendants Kingdon (sellers) appeal the trial court's judgment that the agreement had been rescinded by the parties and that the buyers were entitled to a full refund.
*395 On February 12, 1978, the buyers entered into an earnest money agreement to purchase the sellers' home for $87,500. The agreement provided for an immediate deposit of $1,000, which the buyers paid, to be followed by an additional down payment of $10,000 by March 15, 1978. The buyers were to pay the remainder of the purchase price at the closing which was set on or before April 15, 1978. The agreement provided for the forfeiture of all amounts paid by the buyers as liquidated and agreed damages in the event they failed to complete the purchase. The buyers did not pay the additional $10,000, but paid $9,800 because the parties later agreed on a $200 deduction for a light fixture the sellers were allowed to take from the home. An inscription on the $9,800 check stated all monies paid were "subject to closing."
There were several additional exchanges between the parties after the earnest money agreement was signed. The buyers requested that the sellers fix the patio, which the sellers refused to do. The buyers asked that the sellers paint the front of the home, which Mr. Kingdon agreed to do, but did not accomplish. The parties eventually met to close the sale. The buyers insisted on a $500 deduction from the purchase price because of the sellers' failure to paint. The sellers refused to convey title unless the buyers paid the full purchase price. Because of this impasse, the parties did not close the transaction. Mrs. Allen and Mrs. Kingdon left the meeting, after which Mr. Kingdon orally agreed to refund the $10,800, paid by the buyers. However, three days later, the sellers' attorney sent a letter to the buyers advising them that the sellers would retain enough of the earnest money to cover any damages they would incur in reselling the home. The letter also stated that the buyers could avoid these damages by closing within ten days. The buyers did not offer to close the sale. The home was eventually sold for $89,100, less a commission of $5,346. Claiming damages in excess of $15,000, the sellers retained the entire $10,800 and refused to make any refund to the buyers. The trial court found that the parties had orally rescinded their agreement and ordered the sellers to return the buyers' payments, less $1,000 on a counterclaim of the sellers, which award is not challenged on this appeal.
The sellers first contend that the trial court erred in holding that our statute of frauds permits oral rescission of a written executory contract for the sale of real property. U.C.A., 1953, § 25-5-1 provides:
No estate or interest in real property, other than leases for a term not exceeding one year, nor any trust or power over or concerning real property or in any manner relating thereto, shall be created, granted, assigned, surrendered or declared otherwise than by operation of law, or by deed or conveyance in writing subscribed by the party creating, granting, assigning, surrendering or declaring the same, or by his lawful agent thereunto authorized by writing.
(Emphasis added.) In Cutwright v. Union Savings & Investment Co., 33 Utah 486, 491-92, 94 P. 984, 985 (1908), this Court interpreted section 25-5-1 as follows:
No doubt the transfer of any interest in real property, whether equitable or legal, is within the statute of frauds; and no such interest can either be created, transferred, or surrendered by parol merely.... No doubt, if a parol agreement to surrender or rescind a contract for the sale of lands is wholly executory, and nothing has been done under it, it is within the statute of frauds, and cannot be enforced any more than any other agreement concerning an interest in real property may be.
(Emphasis added.) In that case, the buyer purchased a home under an installment contract providing for the forfeiture of all amounts paid in the event the buyer defaulted. The buyer moved into the home but soon discontinued payments. He informed the seller that he would make no more payments on the contract, surrendered the key to the house, and vacated the premises. Soon thereafter, an assignee of the buyer's interest informed the seller that he intended to make the payments *396 under the contract and demanded possession. The seller refused to accept the payments, claiming that the contract had been mutually rescinded on the buyer's surrender of possession.
We held that the statute of frauds generally requires the surrender of legal and equitable interests in land to be in writing. Where, however, an oral rescission has been executed, the statute of frauds may not apply. In Cutwright, surrender of possession by the buyer constituted sufficient part performance of the rescission agreement to remove it from the statute of frauds. This exception is one of several recognized by our cases. We have also upheld oral rescission of a contract for the sale of land when the seller, in reliance on the rescission, enters into a new contract to resell the land. Budge v. Barron, 51 Utah 234, 244-45, 169 P. 745, 748 (1917). In addition, an oral rescission by the buyer may be enforceable where the seller has breached the written contract. Thackeray v. Knight, 57 Utah 21, 27-28, 192 P. 263, 266 (1920).
In the present case, the oral rescission involved the surrender of the buyers' equitable interest in the home under the earnest money agreement. Further, the rescission was wholly executory. There is no evidence of any part performance of the rescission or that the buyers substantially changed their position in reliance on the promise to discharge the contract. On the contrary, three days after the attempted closing, the sellers informed the buyers that they intended to hold them to the contract. It was only after the buyers continued in their refusal to close that the sellers placed the home on the market.
The buyers argue that the weight of authority in the United States is to the effect that an executory contract for the sale of land within the statute of frauds may be orally rescinded. This may indeed be the case when there are acts of performance of the oral agreement sufficient to take it out of the statute of frauds. See Annot., 42 A.L.R.3d 242, 251 (1972). In support of their contention that an oral rescission of an earnest money agreement for the purchase of land is valid absent any acts of performance, the buyers rely on Niernberg v. Feld, 131 Colo. 508, 283 P.2d 640 (1955). In that case, the Colorado Supreme Court upheld the oral rescission of an executory contract for the sale of land under a statute of frauds which, like Utah's, applies specifically to the surrender of interests in land. The Colorado court concluded that the statute of frauds concerns the making of contracts only and does not apply to their revocation. However, the court did not attempt to reconcile its holding with the contradictory language of the controlling statute. For a contrary result under a similar statute and fact situation, see Waller v. Lieberman, 214 Mich. 428, 183 N.W. 235 (1921). In light of the specific language of Utah's statute of frauds and our decision in Cutwright v. Union Savings & Investment Co., supra, we decline to follow the Colorado case. We note that the annotator at 42 A.L.R.3d 257 points out that in Niernberg the rescission was acted upon in various ways. We hold in the instant case that the wholly executory oral rescission of the earnest money agreement was unenforceable under our statute of frauds.
Nor were the buyers entitled to rescind the earnest money agreement because of the sellers' failure to paint the front of the home as promised. Cf. Thackeray v. Knight, 57 Utah at 27-28, 192 P. at 266 (buyer's oral rescission of contract for sale of land was valid when seller breached contract). The rule is well settled in Utah that if the original agreement is within the statute of frauds, a subsequent agreement that modifies any of the material parts of the original must also satisfy the statute. Golden Key Realty, Inc. v. Mantas, 699 P.2d 730, 732 (Utah 1985). An exception to this general rule has been recognized where a party has changed position by performing an oral modification so that it would be inequitable to permit the other party to found a claim or defense on the original agreement as unmodified. White v. Fox, 665 P.2d 1297, 1301 (Utah 1983) *397 (citing Bamberger Co. v. Certified Productions, Inc., 88 Utah 194, 201, 48 P.2d 489, 492 (1935), aff'd on rehearing, 88 Utah 213, 53 P.2d 1153 (1936)). There is no indication that the buyers changed their position in reliance on the sellers' promise to paint the front of the house. Thus, equitable considerations would not preclude the sellers from raising the unmodified contract as a defense to the claim of breach. The fact that the parties executed several other oral modifications of the written contract does not permit the buyers to rescind the contract for breach of an oral promise on which they did not rely to their detriment. We therefore hold that the buyers were not entitled to rescind the earnest money agreement because of the sellers' failure to perform an oral modification required to be in writing under the statute of frauds.
The buyers also contend that they are entitled to the return of the $10,800 because the inscription on the $9,800 check stated that all monies were paid "subject to closing." The buyers argue that by conditioning the check in this manner they may, in effect, rewrite the earnest money agreement and relieve themselves of any liability for their own failure to close the sale. We cannot accept this argument. The buyers were under an obligation to pay the monies unconditionally. The sellers' acceptance of the inscribed check cannot be construed as a waiver of their right to retain the $10,800 when the buyers failed to perform the agreement.
Having concluded that the buyers breached their obligation under the earnest money agreement, we must next consider whether the liquidated damages provision of the agreement is enforceable. That provision provided that the sellers could retain all amounts paid by the buyers as liquidated and agreed damages in the event the buyers failed to complete the purchase. The general rules in Utah regarding enforcement of liquidated damages for breach of contract have been summarized as follows:
Under the basic principles of freedom of contract, a stipulation to liquidated damages for breach of contract is generally enforceable. Where, however, the amount of liquidated damages bears no reasonable relationship to the actual damage or is so grossly excessive as to be entirely disproportionate to any possible loss that might have been contemplated that it shocks the conscience, the stipulation will not be enforced.
Warner v. Rasmussen, 704 P.2d 559, 561 (Utah 1985) (citations omitted).
In support of their contention that the liquidated damages are not excessive compared to actual damages, the sellers assert that they offered evidence of actual damages in excess of $15,000. However, the trial court disagreed and found the amount of liquidated damages excessive. The record indicates that the only recoverable damages sustained by the sellers resulted from the resale of the home at a lower net price amounting to $3,746 (the difference between the contract price of $87,500 and the eventual selling price, less commission, of $83,754). We agree that $10,800 is excessive and disproportionate when compared to the $3,746 loss of bargain suffered by the sellers. Since the buyers did not ever have possession of the property, the other items of damage claimed by the sellers (interest on mortgage, taxes, and utilities) are not recoverable by them. Perkins v. Spencer, 121 Utah 468, 243 P.2d 446 (1952). Therefore, the sellers are not entitled to retain the full amount paid, but may offset their actual damages of $3,746 against the buyers' total payments. See Soffe v. Ridd, 659 P.2d 1082 (Utah 1983) (seller was entitled to actual damages where liquidated damages provision was held unenforceable).
We reverse the trial court's judgment that the earnest money agreement was rescinded and conclude that the buyers breached their obligation to close the transaction. However, we affirm the judgment below that the liquidated damages provided for were excessive and therefore not recoverable. *398 The case is remanded to the trial court to amend the judgment to award the buyers $7,054, less $1,000 awarded by the trial court to the sellers on their counterclaim which is not challenged on this appeal. No interest or attorney fees are awarded to either party inasmuch as the trial court awarded none and neither party has raised the issue on appeal.
HALL, C.J., and STEWART and DURHAM, JJ., concur.
ZIMMERMAN, Justice (concurring):
I join the majority in its disposition of the various issues. However, the majority quotes from Warner v. Rasmussen, 704 P.2d 559 (Utah 1985), to the effect that contractual provisions for liquidated damages will be enforced unless "the amount of liquidated damages bears no reasonable relationship to the actual damage or is so grossly excessive as to be entirely disproportionate to any loss that might have been contemplated that it shocks the conscience." The Court then finds that the amount of the liquidated damages provided for in the agreement is "excessive and disproportionate" when compared to the actual loss suffered by the sellers, thus implying that in the absence of a disparity as great as that which exists here (actual loss is approximately one-third of the penalty), the standard of Warner v. Rasmussen will not be satisfied.
I think an examination of our cases should suggest to any thoughtful reader that, in application, the test stated in Warner is not nearly as accepting of liquidated damage provisions as the quoted language would suggest. In fact, I believe this Court routinely applies the alternative test of Warnerthat the liquidated damages must bear some reasonable relationship to the actual damagesand that we carefully scrutinize liquidated damage awards. I think it necessary to say this lest the bar be misled by the rather loose language of Warner and its predecessors.

Representing Appellee: Gay Woodhouse, Attorney General; Paul S. Rehurek, Deputy Attorney General; and D. Michael Pauling, Senior Assistant Attorney General.
Before LEHMAN, C.J., and THOMAS, MACY, GOLDEN, and HILL, JJ.
MACY, Justice.
Appellant Donald L. Segnitz appeals from the denials of two motions he filed in two separate courts to correct his illegal sentences. The cases were consolidated for purposes of appeal.
We affirm in part and reverse in part.

ISSUES
In Case No. 99-223, Segnitz presents the following issues for our review:
1. Did the District Court [err] by denying Appellant's Motion to Correct an Illegal Sentence, which was filed because while orally sentenced to concurrent sentences, the Written Judgement and Sentence, and Mitimus failed to stipulate that sentence was concurrent[?]
2. Did the District Court [err] by denying Appellant's Motion to Correct ... an ILLEGAL Sentence, which was filed because the Court did not award credit for time served in it[]s Judgement and Sentence, nor Mitimus[?] Nor had it been *51 addressed orally by the Court at sentencing.
In Case No. 99-254, Segnitz presents the following issues for our review:
A. Did the District Court sentence the Appellant to an illegal term by not abiding by W.R.Cr.P. 32(c)2(C), (E), and (F)?
B. Did the District Court by denying the Motion to Correct an Illegal Sentence and then changing the original sentence abuse it[]s d[i]scretion?
C. If the change in sentence was proper then should the Appellant [be] afforded due process by the District Court?

FACTS
In November of 1997, Segnitz was sentenced in Sweetwater County to serve a term in the Wyoming State Penitentiary of not less than one year nor more than three years, with credit for the time he served in presentence confinement, for the offense of felony larceny. He was released on parole to Community Alternatives of Casper on June 25, 1998. On July 30, 1998, Segnitz departed from Community Alternatives of Casper without authorization, stealing a car to facilitate his exit. He drove to Wheatland where he abandoned this car and stole another, which he drove to Indiana.
Both the Platte County and Natrona County authorities issued arrest warrants for the crimes committed in their respective counties. The Board of Parole issued an order of arrest because Segnitz had violated the terms of his parole for the Sweetwater County felony larceny conviction. Segnitz was arrested in Indiana on August 1, 1998, and later charged with felony larceny in both Platte County and Natrona County. He pleaded guilty to the charges. Segnitz was sentenced on September 10, 1998, in Platte County to a term of not less than two years nor more than four years in the Wyoming State Penitentiary. The order was silent with regard to whether the sentence was to be served concurrently with or consecutively to any other sentences. On March 5, 1999, Segnitz was orally sentenced in Natrona County to the stipulated prison term of three to four years. The stipulation provided for the sentence to be served concurrently with the sentences imposed in Sweetwater County and Platte County. The written Judgment and Sentence failed to mention that the sentence was to be served concurrently with the other sentences, but, three months later, the district court entered an order nunc pro tunc to that effect.
Segnitz arrived at the Wyoming State Penitentiary on or shortly after March 5, 1999, the date he was sentenced in Natrona County. On April 12, 1999, the Board of Parole revoked his parole for the Sweetwater County offense, crediting him "with all of the time during which he was released."
Segnitz filed motions in the district courts of Platte County and Natrona County to correct illegal sentences. In his Platte County motion, Segnitz asserted that the Judgment and Sentence failed to specify how the sentence was to be served with regard to his other sentences. He also complained that the Judgment and Sentence failed to state the number of days awarded as presentence incarceration credit. In response, the district court issued an order wherein it announced that it intended for the sentence to be served consecutively to the others and that Segnitz was not entitled to presentence incarceration credit. In his Natrona County motion, Segnitz claimed that the Judgment and Sentence failed to reflect the district court's oral pronouncement that made the sentence run concurrently with the others and failed to award any presentence incarceration credit. Although the district court initially denied Segnitz's motion, it later entered the order nunc pro tunc referenced above which ordered the sentence for the Natrona County crime to be served concurrently with the other sentences.
Segnitz appeals to the Wyoming Supreme Court.

DISCUSSION

A. Presentence Incarceration Credit
Segnitz contends that both district courts erred when they refused to award credit for the time he spent confined before he was sentenced. The state counters that Segnitz was on parole and in the legal custody *52 of the Board of Parole during the entire time he was confined on these two charges and that the Board of Parole awarded him credit against his Sweetwater County sentence for all the time he spent on parole when his parole was eventually revoked.
The decision to grant or deny a motion to correct an illegal sentence is usually left to the sound discretion of the district court. Hamill v. State, 948 P.2d 1356, 1358 (Wyo.1997). The district court's decision is given considerable deference unless a rational basis does not exist for it. Id. A criminal defendant is entitled to receive credit against his sentence for the time he was incarcerated prior to sentencing, provided that such confinement was because of his inability and failure to post bond on the offense for which he was awaiting disposition. Smith v. State, 988 P.2d 39, 40 (Wyo.1999). A sentence which does not include credit for presentence incarceration is illegal and constitutes an abuse of discretion. Id. A defendant is not, however, entitled to credit for the time he spent in custody when that confinement would have continued despite his ability to post bond. Id.
The Board of Parole revoked Segnitz's parole for the Sweetwater County conviction after he had been sentenced in the Platte County and Natrona County cases. Had the Board of Parole revoked Segnitz's parole before he was sentenced in the Platte County and Natrona County cases, there would be no argument about the fact that those district courts refused to award presentence incarceration credit. We, however, are not concerned with this order of events and agree with the state's observation that Segnitz should not be allowed to apply the credit to the new sentences "simply because his parole was fortuitously revoked" after, and not before, his convictions for the new crimes. When the Board of Parole awarded Segnitz full credit against his Sweetwater County sentence for the time he spent on parole, it cured any problems that existed as a result of the failures by the district courts in Platte County and Natrona County to do so.

B. Concurrent Sentences
Segnitz contends that the district court erred when it ordered his Platte County sentence to run consecutively to the other sentences. The state concedes that Segnitz is correct in this assertion.
The original order was silent with regard to how the Platte County sentence was intended to run with the other sentences. Eleven months later, the district court clarified the Judgment and Sentence by ordering the sentence to run consecutively to the others. In the meantime, the district court of Natrona County ordered its sentence to run concurrently with the other sentences.
When the district court of Platte County entered its order, Segnitz had not yet been prosecuted in Natrona County nor had his parole been revoked. If a defendant is subject to prosecution in more than one court, the decision regarding how the sentences will run with respect to one another should be made by the last judge to impose a sentence. 24 C.J.S. Criminal Law § 1524 (1989). The underlying rationale for this theory is that a judge cannot require a sentence to be served consecutively to a sentence that has not yet been imposed. Id. We agree with the state that this is the best practice and conclude that the district court of Platte County abused its discretion when it ordered its sentence to run consecutively to the others. The district court of Natrona County was the last court to impose a sentence, and it ordered its sentence to run concurrently with the others. That portion of the order for the Platte County offense which directed the sentence to run consecutively to the others is illegal and is hereby stricken.
Affirmed in part and reversed in part.

GREENAWAY, JR., Circuit Judge.

       In plain terms, we are called to decide whether
precluding a father from ever having his born-out-of-wedlock
child derive citizenship through him can be squared with the
equal-protection mandate of the Due Process Clause of the
Fifth Amendment.

       In not so plain terms, under the now repealed 8 U.S.C.
§ 1432(a)(2), a “child” born outside of the United States to
noncitizen parents became a citizen upon the naturalization of




                              2
her surviving parent if one of her parents was deceased.1
Section 1101(c)(1) in turn defined “child” as including a child
born out of wedlock only in so far as the child was legitimated
under the “law of the child’s residence or domicile” or “the law
of the father’s residence or domicile . . . except as otherwise
provided in . . .” § 1432. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(c)(1). Section
1432(a)(3) rounded out the triumvirate and exempted mothers
of born-out-of-wedlock children from the legitimation
requirement by expressly adding that “the naturalization of the
mother” was sufficient “if the child was born out of wedlock
and the paternity of the child has not been established by
legitimation . . . .” See § 1432(a)(3).

       As a result, §§ 1101(c)(1), 1432(a)(2) and (a)(3) treated
women and men differently: a naturalized mother could
transmit her citizenship to her out-of-wedlock child, regardless
of whether the father was alive; whereas a naturalized father in
the same position had the additional requirement of having to
legitimate the child in order to transmit his citizenship.

       Our present concern is not with this differential
treatment, however. That affirmative steps to verify paternity,
including legitimation, may be taken if a citizen parent is an
unwed father has withstood constitutional scrutiny in the past,
on the basis that the relation between a mother and a child “is
verifiable from the birth itself,” and likewise “the opportunity

       1
         That is, provided that (1) the naturalization takes place
while the child is under eighteen years old, and (2) (a) the child
is residing in the United States as a lawful permanent resident
when the parent naturalizes or (b) thereafter begins to reside
permanently while under the age of eighteen. 8 U.S.C.
§ 1432(a)(4) & (5).




                                3
for the development of a relationship between citizen parent
and child . . . .” Nguyen v. INS., 533 U.S. 53, 62, 65 (2001);
see also Trimble v. Gordon, 430 U.S. 762, 771 (1977) (“The
more serious problems of proving paternity might justify a
more demanding standard for illegitimate children claiming
under their fathers’ estates than that required for [those]
claiming under their mothers’ estates . . . .” (emphasis added)).
Rather, like in Trimble, the present concern is with a father
being forever precluded from having his out-of-wedlock child
derive through him. This problem only arises where the child’s
mother is deceased, and the only avenue for legitimation under
the relevant law is through the marriage of the parents. In that
instance, naturalized fathers cannot transmit their citizenship
to their out-of-wedlock children as a result of the interplay
between §§ 1101(c) and 1432(a)(2), whereas naturalized
mothers can via at least § 1432 (a)(3).

        Such is the case with the petition before us. Petitioner
Jose Francisco Tineo was born in the Dominican Republic to
unwed noncitizen parents who never married. His father
moved to the United States and naturalized. His noncitizen
mother soon after passed away. At the time, under the law of
either his or his father’s residence or domicile—the Dominican
Republic and New York—legitimation could only occur if his
birth parents married. So Tineo’s father was forever precluded
from having his son derive citizenship through him, despite
being a citizen and having cared for his son until the child was
21 years old. On the cusp of being removed from the United
States as a noncitizen, Tineo brings this Fifth Amendment
challenge to the relevant provisions on behalf of his now
deceased naturalized father.           We hold that, in this
circumstance, the interplay of §§ 1101(c)(1), 1432(a)(2) and
(a)(3) cannot be squared with the equal-protection mandate of




                               4
the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. We will
therefore grant Tineo’s petition.

                          I. Background

                 A. Arrival in the United States

       Tineo was born in the Dominican Republic on January
16, 1969. His parents, both citizens of the Dominican
Republic, never married. His father, Felipe Tineo, moved to
the United States and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in
1981. Two years later, his father married a legal permanent
resident.

        Tineo came to live with his father once his birth mother
died in 1984. He was admitted to the United States as a lawful
permanent resident on June 15, 1985, pursuant to an alien
relative petition filed by his stepmother. He was 15 years old
at the time and lived with his father until he turned 21 in 1990.

                     B. Removal Proceedings

       Felipe Tineo died an American in 2006. The question
of his son’s citizenship has come up on two occasions: once
before his death and once after. Both were in the context of
removal proceedings. This is in part because only noncitizens
may be removed. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(a)(1); see also Ng
Fung Ho v. White, 259 U.S. 276, 284 (1922) (“Jurisdiction in
the executive to order [removal] exists only if the person . . . is
a [noncitizen]. An assertion of U.S. citizenship is thus a denial
of an essential jurisdictional fact in a [removal] proceeding.”
(internal quotation marks omitted)) (quoted in Minasyan v.
Gonzales, 401 F.3d 1069, 1075 (9th Cir. 2005)); Gonzalez-
Alarcon v. Macias, 884 F.3d 1266, 1272 (10th Cir. 2018)




                                5
(noting that citizenship constitutes the denial of an essential
jurisdictional fact in a removal proceeding because only
noncitizens are removable). As a consequence, immigration
judges terminate removal proceedings where the government
cannot demonstrate that a petitioner is a removable noncitizen.
See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 240.8(a); see also
Dessouki v. Att’y Gen. of U.S., 915 F.3d 964, 966 (3d Cir.
2019) (“[T]he government failed to prove that Dessouki was [a
noncitizen]. So an immigration judge terminated his removal
proceedings.”).

                                1.

        The first proceeding occurred when Tineo was
convicted for the sale of a controlled substance in New York
state court on October 19, 1993. He was issued a Notice to
Appear (“NTA”) dated April 20, 2000 and placed in removal
proceedings based on that conviction. The proceeding was
terminated on November 28, 2001, however, because, as proof
of his citizenship, Tineo produced a United States passport that
was issued to him in 2001.2


       2
         Some confusion exists in the record as to the status of
this passport. While the NTA charges that Tineo obtained this
passport by using fraudulent documents, there is no evidence
to support this claim. The passport application indicates that
the only documents attached as exhibits were Tineo’s birth
certificate, his mother’s death certificate, his father’s
naturalization certificate, and a “memo of law,” which is not in
the record before us. A.R. 302.

        In addition, Tineo clearly disagreed with the IJ when the
IJ stated that he had “falsely represented that [he] was a [U.S.]




                               6
                                2.

      The second occasion arose pursuant to an NTA issued
on October 14, 2014. The NTA charged several bases for
Tineo’s removal, stemming from three events.3

       First, Tineo was convicted on July 8, 2002, of the sale
of a controlled substance in New York state court, thus making
him inadmissible pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)
and (a)(2)(C).




citizen to gain entry to this country.” A.R. 111. Thus, we
cannot find support for the IJ’s statement that Tineo admitted
to obtaining this passport using fraudulent documents. While
not germane to our ultimate decision, we nonetheless wish to
note the lack of any evidence in the record of fraud in
connection with Tineo’s original passport application. As far
as we can discern, the issuance of this passport in 2001 did not
occur because of any fraudulent misrepresentations made by
Tineo.
       3
         Since, according to the government, Tineo was not
admitted in 2008 when he returned to the United States from a
trip abroad, the statutes cited in the NTA involve grounds for
inadmissibility. Because the Illegal Immigration Reform and
Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 eliminated separate
exclusion and deportation proceedings, creating instead a
single removal proceeding, Austin T. Fragomen, et al.,
Fragomen on Immigration Fundamentals: A Guide to Law and
Practice § 1:3.3[D] (PLI) (5th ed. 2019), this technicality does
not impact our analysis.




                               7
       Second, on January 15, 2008, upon returning to the
United States after a trip abroad, Tineo presented the passport
issued to him in 2001. The NTA charged that “[i]n doing so,
[he] falsely represented [him]self to be a [U.S.] Citizen . . . to
gain entry into the United States,” thus violating §
1182(a)(6)(C)(i) and (ii). A.R. 890. The NTA also charged
Tineo as being an alien present in the United States without
being admitted or paroled, in violation of § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i).
This violation was based on the fact that, because Tineo used a
United States passport to enter the country and “U.S. Citizens
are not inspected, [Tineo] entered without being admitted or
paroled after inspection by an Immigration Officer.” A.R. 377.

       The third event providing a basis for Tineo’s removal
was his conviction in 2014 of passport fraud and aggravated
identity theft in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. This
conviction arose when, after his passport expired, Tineo
attempted to obtain a new passport using the name Luis Padilla.
Tineo presented several identification documents in the name
Luis Padilla in support of his passport application. Based on
this conviction, the NTA charged Tineo as inadmissible,
pursuant to § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I).

                    C. Challenges to Removal

       Appearing pro se before the immigration judge, Tineo
admitted to his criminal convictions, but challenged his
removability on the grounds that (1) he derived citizenship
through his father and (2) this was evinced by his legally

        Tineo also sought relief pursuant to the Convention
Against Torture but did not raise that claim in his opening brief

      His derivative citizenship claim was based on former 8
U.S.C. § 1432(a),5 which provides that:

       A child born outside of the United States of alien
       parents, or of an alien parent and a citizen parent
       who has subsequently lost citizenship of the
       United States, becomes a citizen of the United
       States upon fulfillment of the following
       conditions:



before this Court. It is therefore waived. See United States v.
Pelullo, 399 F.3d 197, 222 (3d Cir. 2005) (“It is well settled
that an appellant’s failure to identify or argue an issue in his
opening brief constitutes waiver of that issue on appeal.”)
(citations omitted).
       5
           As we have noted,

       Congress repealed section 1432(a) by enacting
       the Child Citizenship Act of 2000 [(“CCA”)], §
       103, [8 U.S.C. §§ 1431–33 (2001)]. The [CCA]
       became effective on February 27, 2001, 120 days
       following its enactment. Because all relevant
       events respecting [Petitioner]’s claimed
       derivative citizenship occurred prior to the
       [CCA]’s effective date, [§] 1432(a) controls our
       analysis.

         Read literally, § 1432(a)(2) appears to require that first
one parent has to die and then the second parent has to
naturalize. But the United States Citizenship and Immigration
Services (“USCIS”) has determined that the order of events
does not matter, so long as all events occur before the child’s
eighteenth birthday. Matter of Baires-Larios, 24 I. & N. Dec.

      to reside permanently in the United States while
      under the age of eighteen years.

8 U.S.C. § 1432(a) (repealed by Pub. L. No. 106-395, Title I,
§ 103(a), Oct. 30, 2000, 114 Stat. 1632) (emphasis added).

      The statute defines “child” as meaning:

      an unmarried person under twenty-one years of
      age and includes a child legitimated under the
      law of the child’s residence or domicile, or under
      the law of the father’s residence or domicile,
      whether in the United States or elsewhere . . . .

§ 1101(c)(1) (emphasis added).7



      7
         The definition continues to also include a child
adopted in the United States if, as to both adopted and
legitimated children and except as otherwise provided in
sections 1431 and 1432 of the title:

      such legitimation or adoption takes place before
      the child reaches the age of 16 years (except to
      the extent that the child is described in
      subparagraph (E)(ii) or (F)(ii) of subsection
      (b)(1)), and the child is in the legal custody of the
      legitimating or adopting parent or parents at the
      time of such legitimation or adoption.

§ 1101(c)(1).




                               11
        The United States Citizenship and Immigration
Services (“USCIS”) interpreted the language beginning with
“and includes” as restricting the meaning of child to exclude
children born out of wedlock who were not legitimated,
regardless of whether they were unmarried and under the age
of 21. When Tineo filed an application for a certificate of
citizenship—also known as a Form N-600—in 2007, USCIS
denied his application because he was “a child born out of
wedlock” and “had not been legitimated by his [U.S.] citizen
father . . . .” App 4. In denying Tineo’s derivative citizenship
claim, the Immigration Judge (IJ) stated that “[t]he CIS denial
letter [regarding the N-600 application] . . . correctly noted the
law.” App. 10. That is, “children born out of wedlock who
have not been legitimated are not included in the definition of
‘child’ under the INA.” App. 10.8



       8
         As Tineo points out, this reading is counterintuitive
and counter-textual, for it requires a tortured construction of
the phrase “and includes.” It also implies that a child born out
of wedlock that is seeking to derive citizenship through her
mother must also be legitimated under the law of her own
residence or domicile or that of her father. This implication
came to bear when Congress passed the CCA.

        The CCA repealed former § 1432(a) and enacted §
1431(a) in its place. The new provision did away with §
1432(a)(3) such that it remained an open question as to whether
§ 1101(c)(1)’s legitimation requirement would extend to
mothers. The White House Office of Legal Counsel examined
the issue, labeled § 1101(c)(1) “poorly drafted,” and outlined a
number of permissible interpretations that would avoid
imposing a legitimation requirement on mothers.              See




                               12
        At the time Tineo was born, the only way a child could
be legitimated in the Dominican Republic was through the
marriage of the parents prior to the child’s sixteenth birthday.
New York also required marriage of the parents in order to
legitimate a child. Tineo attempted to establish that his
parents, who were never legally married, had a common law
marriage. He provided a letter from the Dominican Republic
consulate, noting that “common-law marriage is recognized by
our Supreme Court through a judgment dated October 17,
2001, in the case of a lawsuit against an insurance company
due to the death of a partner.” App. 11, A.R. 943. However,
there was no evidence that this decision was retroactive such
that it would apply to prior unions. The IJ thus determined that
Tineo’s parents did not have a common law marriage at the
relevant time.

        The Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) affirmed
the IJ’s decision. It found “no clear error in the Immigration
Judge’s factual finding that the respondent has not presented
evidence of legitimization . . . , such that he has not established
that he was a ‘child’ for purposes of deriving citizenship
through his father.” App. 6. Tineo argued that the definition
of “child” “creates an unconstitutional gender-based
distinction between mothers and fathers, in violation of the
equal protection clause of the Constitution.” Id. But the BIA
concluded that it lacked “jurisdiction to entertain such a
challenge.” Id.

                                 2.

        Tineo further argued that the IJ erred in not finding that
he was a U.S. citizen based on the issuance of his first passport.
Relying on Delmore v. Brownell, 236 F.2d 598 (3d Cir. 1956),
Matter of Villanueva, 19 I. & N. Dec. 101 (BIA 1984), and
Matter of Peralta, 10 I. & N. Dec. 43 (BIA 1962), Tineo’s view
was “that unless it is void on its face, a valid United States
passport issued to an individual as a citizen of the United States
is not subject to collateral attack in administrative immigration
proceedings, but constitutes conclusive proof of such person’s
[U.S.] citizenship.” App. 5. The BIA rejected this argument,
based on new precedent from this Court in United States v.
Moreno, 727 F.3d 255 (3d Cir. 2013). In Moreno, we held that
“a passport constitutes conclusive proof of citizenship only if
the passport was issued to a U.S. citizen.” Id. at 257.9

           D. Petition for Review and Motion to Remand

       Tineo filed a timely petition for review with this Court.
In lieu of filing a brief, the government moved to remand to
allow the BIA “to provide a more fulsome explanation as to
what weight should be afforded a previously-valid, but expired
passport in establishing citizenship.” Mot. to Remand 1. The
case was then stayed, pending the decision in Sessions v.

       9
          We also note that our precedent in Delmore did not
hold that a passport was conclusive proof of citizenship.
Rather, we stated that “[o]nce the United States has determined
that an individual is a citizen, it should be required to disprove
its own determination by clear, unequivocal, and convincing
evidence.” Delmore, 236 F.2d at 600 (internal quotation marks
omitted).




                               14
Morales-Santana, 137 S. Ct. 1678 (2017). Upon issuance of
the Supreme Court’s decision, Tineo filed a new opening brief,
to which the government replied. In its brief, the government
noted that it no longer believed remand was necessary since the
only issues presented involved legal questions, which this
Court could address without input from the BIA. In light of
this admission, we deny the motion to remand.

        II. Jurisdiction and Standard/Scope of Review

                         A. Jurisdiction

        We have jurisdiction to decide a nationality claim under
8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(5)(A), since “no genuine [dispute] of
material fact about the petitioner’s nationality is presented.”
Dessouki, 915 F.3d at 966–67 (affirming that “§ 1252(b)(5)(A)
is best read as granting jurisdiction”). We also have
jurisdiction to review constitutional claims under §
1252(a)(2)(D).

        That Tineo’s claim is premised on his father’s
constitutional rights is of no moment. Typically, a party has to
assert his own legal rights and cannot rely on the legal rights
of third parties. Morales-Santana, 137 S.Ct. at 1689. But, as
the Supreme Court articulated,

       we recognize an exception where, as here, the
       party asserting the right has a close relationship
       with the person who possesses the right [and]
       there is a hindrance to the possessor’s ability to
       protect his own interests.

Id. (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted)
(quoting Kowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U.S. 125, 130 (2004)). As




                              15
Felipe Tineo’s son, Tineo satisfies the “close relationship”
requirement, while his father’s death establishes the hindrance
to his father’s ability to assert this claim on his own. See id.
(considering the petitioner-child as the “obvious claimant” and
“best available proponent” of the equal protection rights of his
deceased father whose “failure to assert a claim in his own right
stem[med] from disability, not disinterest (internal quotation
marks and citations omitted)); see also Breyer v. Meissner, 214
F.3d 416, 423 (3d Cir. 2000) (holding that the petitioner could
assert his mother’s equal protection rights because “his own
alleged deprivation of citizenship as a result of discrimination
against his mother constitute[d] injury-in-fact, the closeness of
his relationship to his mother [was] obvious, and his mother’s
death most definitely constitute[d] a hindrance to her assertion
of her own rights”).

               B. Standard and Scope of Review

       Though he asks us to employ any number of
mechanisms to cure the constitutional infirmity he asserts,
Tineo’s challenge remains that, in conjunction with the
government’s construction of “child,” as defined in §
1101(c)(1), and the prior legitimation laws of New York and
the Dominican Republic, §§ 1432(a)(2) and (a)(3) prohibited a
father from transmitting his citizenship to his born-out-of-
wedlock child in his care when the child’s mother was
deceased, while allowing similarly situated mothers to so
transmit. Appellant’s Op. Br. 48. Tineo’s is thus a challenge
to a citizenship-determining “legislation that differentiate[d]
on the basis of gender,” Morales-Santana, 137 S. Ct. at 1690,
and that did so in an allegedly unconstitutional manner in his
case.

                                1.




                               16
       The standard of review for such a challenge is
intermediate scrutiny. That is, the legislation will only
withstand constitutional scrutiny if its defender shows “at least
that the challenged classification serves important
governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means
employed are substantially related to the achievement of those
objectives.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citations
omitted).

       This is not merely because the legislation differentiates
on the basis of gender. Indeed, because of Congress’s “broad
power to admit or exclude [noncitizens],” statutes governing
immigration benefits to noncitizens need only be supported by
a rational basis, even where they differentiate on the basis of
gender. See Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787, 788–89, 792–96
(1977). Rather, it is also because, as was the case in Morales-
Santana, Tineo claims that “he is” and has for some time been
“a U.S. citizen.” See Morales-Santana, 137 S. Ct. at 1693–94
(applying an “exacting standard of review” to “a claim of th[e
same] order”); see also Dent v. Sessions, 900 F.3d 1075, 1081
(9th Cir. 2018) (overturning prior ruling that rational basis
review applied even where the relevant statute governs who is
and is not a citizen in light of Morales-Santana). The
government concedes as much. See Resp’t Br. 33.

       Similar to the Ninth Circuit, we previously assessed
whether “[f]ormer 8 U.S.C. § 1432’s restrictions on derivative
citizenship based solely on the father’s naturalization [were]
rationally related” to the reasons proffered by the government.
Catwell v. Att’y Gen. of U.S., 623 F.3d 199, 211 (3d Cir. 2010)
(emphasis added). Catwell did involve the slightly different
circumstance of a noncitizen challenging a citizenship-
conferring statute on his own behalf, id. at 210 (“Petitioner




                               17
contends that former 8 U.S.C. § 1432(a)(3) ‘unconstitutionally
discriminates against [him] based upon legitimacy and
gender.’”) (quoting Catwell’s Br. 53). That is enough to
distinguish it from Breyer, which applied intermediate scrutiny
where a noncitizen presented a gender-based equal protection
challenge to a citizenship-conferring statute because the
challenge was on behalf of his citizen parent. 214 F.3d at 423–
24. But not from Morales-Santana. This is because, unlike
Breyer, there is no indication that Morales-Santana’s
application of intermediate scrutiny was premised on anything
other than the fact that the petitioner’s challenge was gender-
based and he “claim[ed] he [was] . . . a U.S. citizen.” 137 S.
Ct. at 1693–94.

       So we too must relent: in accordance with United States
v. Tann, 577 F.3d 533, 541 (3d Cir. 2009), based on intervening
Supreme Court precedent, this panel declines to follow our
Court’s precedential decision in Catwell. We will apply
intermediate scrutiny in this case and do so because Tineo
presents a gender-based equal protection challenge and claims
that he is a U.S. citizen.

                               2.

       The scope of the challenge is as-applied. This entails a
concession that the statute at issue may be constitutional in
many of its applications but contends “that its application to a
particular person under particular circumstances deprived that
person of a constitutional right.” United States v. Marcavage,
609 F.3d 264, 273 (3d Cir. 2010) (citation omitted). In
contrast, a facial challenge “tests a law’s constitutionality
based on its text alone and does not consider the facts or
circumstances of a particular case.” Id. (citation omitted).
Properly understood, Tineo’s challenge turns on the particular




                              18
circumstances at hand: the statute’s interaction with the New
York and Dominican Republic laws and his particular family
circumstances.

        By contrast, many jurisdictions have abolished
distinctions between legitimated and unlegitimated children or
eased the burden on unwed fathers to legitimate their children.
See, e.g., Brandao v. Att’y Gen. of U.S., 654 F.3d 427, 430 (3d
Cir. 2011) (abolished in Cape Verde); Anderson v. Holder, 673
F.3d 1089, 1101–02 (9th Cir. 2012) (eased in Arizona).
Indeed, in 2015, the BIA observed the “growing consensus—
both in the United States and abroad—against labeling children
[]‘legitimate’ and ‘illegitimate’ by virtue of the marital status
of their parents.” Matter of Cross, 26 I. & N. Dec. 485, 492
(BIA 2015). So it eased the burden on unwed fathers in some
jurisdictions by holding that, for the purposes of § 1101(c)(1),
a father need not follow the formal process required to
legitimate a child if that jurisdiction has eliminated all legal
distinctions between “legitimate” and “illegitimate” children.
Id.10 Additionally, as the government points out, as early as
1940, nearly half of all states permitted a father to take some
action other than marrying the child’s mother in order to
legitimate a child born out of wedlock. Resp’t Br. 41 (citing
Nationality Manual § 1041.861).




       10
          The burden still remains in jurisdictions that maintain
the distinction, since § 1101(c)(1) has not been amended.




                               19
                         III.    Discussion

                            A. Challenge

        Moving to the challenge itself, it is twofold. Tineo first
asks that we avoid the constitutional question by rejecting the
government’s construction of “child,” as defined in 8 U.S.C. §
1101(c)(1), and instead construe the provision as including
anyone who is unmarried and under the age of 21.
Alternatively, he asks that we deem the interplay between §§
1101(c)(1) and 1432(a) unconstitutional as applied to his
father.

                                  1.

        Section 1101(c)(1) is the linchpin of the denial of
Tineo’s constitutional avoidance argument. This is because §
1101(c)(1) has been interpreted to require that a child born out
of wedlock must be legitimated in order to be considered a
“child” as incorporated in § 1432(a). So read, it tethers
legitimation to the law of the residence or domicile of the father
or child. In the context of laws that only permit legitimation
through marriage, then, § 1101(c)(1) causes § 1432(a)(2) to
prevent a surviving father from ever transmitting citizenship to
his child “if the child remained unlegitimated at the time of the
mother’s death.” Pet’r’s Op. Br. 16. Further, “[t]he father
would be powerless to change this result by adopting or
legitimating the child, since adoption is unavailable to
biological fathers . . . .” Id. at 19–20. In contrast, a naturalized
mother may transmit citizenship to her “child [who] was born
out of wedlock and [whose] paternity . . . has not been
established by legitimation.” § 1432(a)(3).




                                20
       We agree that the government’s construction of §
1101(c)(1) plays a role in the alleged constitutional violation,
but pinning it all on that provision in the way Tineo proposes
would be strong medicine for what is an otherwise narrow
infirmity.

        Under the government’s construction, § 1101(c)(1)
merely imposes a legitimation requirement on the fathers of
children born out of wedlock. While this imposition engenders
a differentiation between women and men, it is akin to gender-
based differentiation that has withstood constitutional scrutiny.
Indeed, in Nguyen, the Supreme Court upheld imposing
affirmative steps, including legitimation, on unwed fathers but
not mothers so long as they were not “onerous” and did not
create “inordinate and unnecessary hurdles to conferral of
citizenship on the children of citizen fathers.” Nguyen, 533
U.S. at 62, 65, 70–71. This is because the relation between a
mother and a child “is verifiable from the birth itself,” and the
same is true of “the opportunity for the development of a
relationship between citizen parent and child . . . .” Id. at 62,
65. These same biological differences led the Court to opine
in Trimble that “[t]he more serious problems of proving
paternity might justify a more demanding standard for
illegitimate children claiming under their fathers’ estates than
that required for [those] claiming under their mothers’ estates .
. . .” 430 U.S. at 771 (emphasis added).

       Assuming arguendo that we would be able to,
construing § 1101(c)(1) in the way Tineo proposes would
effectively invalidate the legitimation requirement in most
instances. Rather than applying in every case in which a child
is born out of wedlock and only the father naturalizes, the
requirement would only apply where this was true and the out-
of-wedlock child married or was over the age of 21. When




                               21
coupled with the requirement that the parent’s naturalization
needs to happen while the child is under eighteen years of age,
see § 1432(a)(4), the requirement would become a shell of its
former self. This effect is even broader when one considers
that § 1101(c)(1) continues to play a role in the renewed §
1431(a), which also requires that the child be “under the age of
eighteen years” when the parent naturalizes. § 1431(a)(2).

       Regardless of the merits (or lack thereof) of imposing a
legitimation requirement on the fathers of children born out of
wedlock, invalidating a provision’s operation in a vast number
of instances across two different statutes, one of which is not
at issue, is too strong a medicine for avoiding or curing the
otherwise narrow infirmity Tineo has identified. Tineo’s father
was unable to have his born-out-of-wedlock child derive
citizenship through him, whereas a similarly situated mother
would have faced no such roadblock. Though § 1101(c)(1) sets
the stage for this disparate treatment, § 1432(a)(2) and (a)(3)
are the main acts. We therefore consider the infirmity alleged
by Tineo, with due attention to how the provisions operate in
concert.

                                 2.

          As we have noted in prior cases, “the standard of review
. . . is often outcome determinative.” Connelly v. Steel Valley
Sch. Dist., 706 F.3d 209, 213 (3d Cir. 2013). This case is no
different. To survive the challenge Tineo presents, the
government is required to show that §§ 1101(c)(1) and
1432(a)’s classification “serve an important governmental
interest today.” Morales-Santana, 137 S. Ct. at 1690. This is
because, “in interpreting the Equal Protection Clause, the
[Supreme] Court has recognized that new insights and societal
understandings can reveal unjustified inequality . . . that once




                               22
passed unnoticed and unchallenged.” Obergefell v. Hodges,
135 S. Ct. 2584, 2603 (2015) (quoted in Morales-Santana, 137
S. Ct. at 1690). This is a tall order for the government, as it
requires justifying treating Tineo’s father as being so different
from a similarly situated mother of an out-of-wedlock child
that Tineo’s father ought to never be able to transmit his
citizenship to Tineo.

        Unsurprisingly, the order is too tall: the government’s
justification is unavailing in these circumstances.

        It proffers that the classification is a tailored means by
Congress to avoid “usurping the traditional province of states,
and foreign countries, to regulate domestic relationships.”
Resp’t Br. 35–36, 38. In essence, Congress wanted to “defer
to states’ laws on legitimacy” that “did not permit a[n
unlegitimated] child to inherit from his . . . father.” Id. at 40.
This justification is tantamount to asserting that the federal
government has an important interest in perpetuating
discrimination under state or foreign law against the fathers of
nonmarital children, a premise that is at odds with Supreme
Court precedent. See Morales-Santana, 137 S. Ct. at 1700
n.25. As the Court observed, “[d]istinctions based on parents’
marital status . . . are subject to the same heightened scrutiny
as distinctions based on gender.” Id.; cf. Cabrera v. Att’y Gen.
of U.S., 921 F.3d 401, 404 (3d Cir. 2019) (applying rational
basis review to disparate treatment of biological and adoptive
children in the context of 8 U.S.C. § 1409). Permitting the
government to impose one dubious classification merely to
entrench another would be absurd.

       Even if this interest did not equate to the perpetuation
of discrimination against unwed fathers, the government has
not articulated how deferring to state legitimation rules




                               23
constitutes an important governmental interest “today.” See id.
at 1690. Although some states have not formally abolished the
distinction between legitimated and unlegitimated children,
these classifications now have little import under state law:
long gone are the days when unlegitimated children simply
could not inherit. See, e.g., N.Y. Est. Powers & Trs. Law § 4-
1.2(2)(C) (allowing unlegitimated children to inherit if they
provide results from a paternity test or “evidence that the father
openly and notoriously acknowledged the child as his own”).
But, when coupled with the circumstances of Tineo’s case, §§
1101(c)(1) and 1432(a)’s legitimation rule turns these largely
meaningless vestiges of a bygone era into the defining
characteristic for whether naturalized fathers can ever transmit
citizenship to their born-out-of-wedlock children.

        Our dissenting colleague would like us to cast this
reality aside because, “in legislating, Congress is not required
to anticipate every potential outcome that results from the
application of a statute in order for it to pass constitutional
muster.” Diss. Op. 5.11 The view originates from a passage in


       11
          To be clear, our colleague is not suggesting that
Congress need not consider the Constitution when legislating.
This proposition finds no support in our jurisprudence, the
Supreme Court’s, or that of any of our sister circuits. It is
elemental that Congress cannot legislate beyond the limits set
by the Constitution. Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 138
(1803) (“An act of congress repugnant to the constitution
cannot become law.” (emphasis added)). So, while it may well
be true that Congress is not required to anticipate every
potential outcome that results from the application of its
statutes, we are obliged to hold it accountable for those
applications that are unconstitutional. See, e.g., id. at 177–78




                               24
Nguyen. The Court had acknowledged the importance of
assuring the existence of a relationship between citizen parent
and child, both as a biological matter and in terms of the
opportunity for a true relationship to develop between the two.
Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 62, 65 (acknowledging that the biological
relationship between a mother and child is “verifiable from the
birth itself,” and “likewise the opportunity for the development
of a relationship between citizen parent and child”). In
response, the “petitioners assert[ed] that, although a mother
will know of her child’s birth, knowledge that one is a parent,
no matter how it is acquired, does not guarantee a relationship
with one’s child.” Id. at 69. The Court dismissed this assertion
on the ground that, “even [if] one conceive[d] of the interest
Congress pursue[d] as establishment of a real, practical
relationship of considerable substance between parent and
child in every case,” its chosen means would “meet[] the equal
protection standard . . . so long as it is substantially related to
the achievement of the governmental objective in question.”
Id. at 70 (emphases added) (internal quotation marks and
citations omitted). It then clarified this point by explaining that
the means-end fit required to survive intermediate scrutiny
does not require that the means be “capable of achieving [the]
ultimate objective in every instance.” Id.

       With this as the background, there is no disagreement
that the existence of a relationship between citizen parent and
child is an important governmental objective, particularly in
the “difficult context of conferring citizenship on a vast

(“[I]f a law be in opposition to the constitution [and] both the
law and the constitution apply to a particular case, . . . the court
must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the
case. This is of the very essence of judicial duty.”).




                                25
number of persons.” Id. at 70. We also agree that the means-
end fit required to survive intermediate scrutiny does not mean
that 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(c)(1) and 1432(a)(2) and (a)(3) have to
ensure that this relationship exists in every instance. But Tineo
does not contend otherwise: he simply asks us to determine
whether the means-end fit was sufficiently close when those
provisions did not permit his father to transmit citizenship to
him, without providing any practicable way for his father to
demonstrate that the requisite relationship existed between the
two.

        To that effect, the Supreme Court has long recognized
that “laws treating fathers and mothers differently may not be
constitutionally applied . . . where the mother and father are in
fact similarly situated with regard to their relationship with the
child.” Morales-Santana, 137 S. Ct. at 1693 n. 12 (2017)
(alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted)
(quoting Lehr v. Robertson, 463 U.S. 248, 267 (1983)). It thus
saw no equal protection problem where an unwed father who
“ha[d] never supported and rarely seen” his child complained
that he was entitled to receive notice of a proceeding to adopt
her. Lehr, 463 U.S. at 250. The Court concluded that “the New
York statutes adequately protected appellant’s inchoate
interest in establishing a relationship with [his daughter],” and
thus found “no merit in the claim that his constitutional rights
were offended.” Id. at 262–65; see also Morales-Santana, 137
S. Ct. at 1693 n.12 (explaining that “[t]he ‘similarly situated’
condition was not satisfied in Lehr, [because] the father in that
case had ‘never established any custodial, personal, or
financial relationship’ with the child”). Notably, the statutes
provided that the father would have been entitled to notice had
he done any one of the following: (1) filed his name in the
state’s putative father registry, (2) established paternity by




                               26
adjudication, (3) been identified as the child’s father on her
birth certificate, (4) openly lived with the child’s mother and
held himself out to be her father, (5) identified as the father in
a sworn statement, or (6) married the child’s mother before she
turned six months old. Id. at 251.

        Tellingly, the Court took the opposite view with an
Illinois statute that outright terminated the custody rights of an
unwed father who had “lived with his children all their lives
and had lived with their mother for eighteen years,” and
thereby rendered “the nature of the actual relationship between
parent and child . . . completely irrelevant.” Lehr, 463 U.S. at
258–59. (emphasis added) (referring to Stanley v. Illinois, 405
U.S. 645, 655 (1972)). Specifically, the statute permitted the
state to “circumvent neglect proceedings on the theory that an
unwed father [was] not a ‘parent’ whose existing relationship
with his children must be considered.” Stanley, 405 U.S. at
649–50. As the Court put it, such a law “conclusively
presumed every father of a child born out of wedlock to be an
unfit person to have custody of his children.” Lehr, 463 U.S.
at 258 (emphasis added).               The Court found this
“constitutionally repugnant,” because even if “most unmarried
fathers are unsuitable and neglectful parents . . . some are
wholly suited to have custody of their children,” and the “State
readily concede[d]” that there was no evidence that the father
“[was] or ha[d] been a neglectful father who ha[d] not cared
for his children.” Stanley, 405 U.S. at 649, 654–55.

       Nothing in Nguyen suggests that the Court has departed
from this course. Like the New York statutes in Lehr, 8 U.S.C.
§ 1409(a)(4) imposed what the Court characterized as a
“minimal” burden on unwed fathers to demonstrate the
existence of a relationship with their child as a prerequisite for
transmitting citizenship. Nguyen, 633 U.S. at 70. The father




                               27
could take the “least onerous of . . . the[] simple steps and
alternatives” of legitimating the child under the law of the
child’s residence or domicile, acknowledging paternity in
writing under oath, or establishing paternity by adjudication of
a competent court. Id. at 59, 69–71 (emphases added). In
contrast, the burden imposed on Tineo’s father to demonstrate
the existence of a relationship to Tineo was not only onerous,
it was impossible. Indeed, like Stanley, the actual relationship
between Felipe Tineo and his child was rendered completely
irrelevant, and he was conclusively presumed to be unfit to
transmit citizenship to his child.

      We thus maintain that, when applied to his
circumstance, the provisions from which such a burden and
presumption stem—§§ 1101(c)(1) and 1432(a)(2) and (a)(3)—
cannot be squared with the equal-protection mandate of the
Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

                            B. Remedy

        Anticipating this result, the government suggests that
we “should not fashion a remedy and, instead, leave that work
to Congress.” Resp’t Br. 48. In so suggesting, the government
advances the view that we do not have the “power to provide
relief of the sort requested in this [petition]—namely, conferral
of citizenship on a basis other than that prescribed by
Congress.” Morales-Santana, 137 S. Ct. at 1701 (Thomas, J.,
joined by Alito, J., concurring in part) (internal quotation
marks and citations omitted). We do not subscribe to this view.
See Breyer, 214 F.3d at 429 (finding an equal protection
violation in a derivative citizenship statute, and providing that,
pursuant to additional findings by the District Court, the
noncitizen petitioner would “be entitled to American
citizenship relating back to his birth”).




                               28
        As an initial matter, a judgment in Tineo’s favor “would
confirm [his] pre-existing citizenship rather than grant [him]
rights that [he] does not now possess.” Miller v. Albright, 523
U.S. 420, 432 (1998) (opinion of Stevens, J.). Or, more
precisely, what Tineo seeks is “severance of the offending
provisions so that the statute, free of its constitutional defect,
can operate to determine whether citizenship was transmitted”
by his father. Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 95–96 (O’Connor, J.,
dissenting) (citing Miller, 523 U.S. at 488–89) (Breyer, J.,
dissenting)); Oral Arg. Audio 9:38–10:04. Indeed, as long ago
as 1898, the Supreme Court invalidated the application of the
Chinese Exclusion Act to a man born in the United States and
who therefore, under the Fourteenth Amendment, had been a
citizen since birth. See United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169
U.S. 649, 704 (1898).

        More to the point, the view espoused by the government
has never commanded a majority of the Supreme Court, and,
in fact, as the authoring Justice Scalia bemoaned, “[a] majority
of the Justices . . . concluded otherwise in” Miller and “the
Court . . . proceed[ed] on the same assumption” in Nguyen.
Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 73–74 (Scalia, J., joined by Thomas, J.,
concurring) (concluding that it was thus “appropriate . . . to
reach the merits of petitioners’ equal protection claims [and]
join the opinion of the Court”).

        The principal case cited by the government—INS v.
Pangilinan, 486 U.S. 875, 883 (1988)—does not convince us
otherwise. That case involved the judicial conferral of
citizenship as an equitable remedy where there was no finding
that the statute was constitutionally infirm. Section 701 of the
1940 Nationality Act provided an avenue by which noncitizens
who served in World War II could naturalize without having to
meet a residency or English-proficiency requirement. Id. at




                               29
877–88. That pathway presumed that a representative would
be designated to receive petitions, conduct hearings, and grant
naturalizations overseas. Id. at 878. For foreign-policy
reasons, the Attorney General deprived the Philippine Islands
of such a representative for a nine-month period. Id. at 879–
80. This led to a stream of litigation by Filipino veterans who
did not naturalize before the 1940 Act expired. Id. at 880. Two
cases made it to the Ninth Circuit and were consolidated. Id.
The Ninth Circuit held that the deprivation of a representative
in the Philippines violated the mandate of the 1940 Act and
awarded an equitable remedy by retroactively conferring
citizenship. Id. at 882. The Supreme Court reversed because,
like the doctrine of equitable estoppel, equitable remedies
cannot “override a public policy established by Congress . . . .”
Id. at 883 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). That
is, “the power to make someone a citizen of the United States
has not been conferred upon the federal courts, like mandamus
or injunction, as one of their generally applicable equitable
powers.” Id. at 883–84 (emphasis added).

        That statement and holding have no bearing where the
Constitution is concerned. See Nguyen, 523 U.S. at 95–96
(O’Connor, J., joined by Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ.,
dissenting). In that instance, the notion that a court is not
empowered to fashion a remedy finds support in only an
exceedingly strict view of the plenary power doctrine. See
Miller, 523 U.S. at 455–56 (Scalia, J., concurring in the
judgment) (“It is in my view incompatible with the plenary
power of Congress over those fields for judges to speculate as
to what Congress would have enacted if it had not enacted what
it did . . . .”). It was not too long ago that a similarly strict
treatment of this doctrine resulted in the condonation of even
the most blatant discrimination. See, e.g., The Chinese




                               30
Exclusion Case, 130 U.S. 581, 610–11 (1889) (establishing the
modern plenary-power doctrine in upholding the Chinese
Exclusion Act); Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149 U.S. 698,
732, 13 S. Ct. 1016, 1017 (1893) (holding that the political
branches could deport residents based solely on their race and
deem all people of “the Chinese race” incompetent to sign the
affidavit needed for Chinese immigrants to remain lawfully);
id. at 763 (Fuller, J., dissenting) (castigating the majority’s
decision as “incompatible with the immutable principles of
justice, inconsistent with the nature of our government, and in
conflict with the written constitution by which that government
was created, and those principles secured”); Boutilier v. INS,
387 U.S. 118, 122–24 (1967) (holding that Congress could
deem gay men excludable “as afflicted with a . . . psychopathic
personality” under the plenary-power doctrine).

       Unsurprisingly, then, while continuing to recognize the
broad deference owed to Congress in immigration matters, the
Supreme Court has in recent years curtailed the plenary-power
doctrine’s excesses, both by clarifying that rational-basis
review still adheres upon its invocation and by limiting the
classes of persons subject thereto. See, e.g., Morales-Santana,
137 S. Ct. at 1693–94; INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 940–41
(1983) (rejecting the government’s invocation of the plenary-
power doctrine because the case concerned “whether Congress
has chosen a constitutionally permissible means of
implementing that power”). We, too, have recognized that the
plenary-power doctrine—while affording Congress great
discretion—“is subject to important constitutional limitations,”
and “it is the province of the courts” to enforce those
constraints. Osorio-Martinez v. Att’y Gen. of U.S., 893 F.3d
153, 175 (3d Cir. 2018) (quoting Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S.




                              31
678, 695 (2001)) (holding that children with special immigrant
juvenile status may invoke the Suspension Clause).

        That curtailment is further apparent from the Court’s
remedy analysis in Morales-Santana. After finding an
unconstitutional infirmity with the provisions at issue, the
Court engaged in precisely the sort of “speculat[ion] as to what
Congress would have enacted if it had not enacted what it did”
Justice Scalia cautioned against in his concurrence in Miller.
The equal protection infirmity at issue was that the statute
retained a longer physical-presence requirement for unwed
citizen fathers to transmit citizenship to their children born
abroad to a noncitizen mother than for similarly situated unwed
citizen mothers. Morales-Santana, 137 S. Ct. at 1698. The
petitioner asked the Court to extend the benefit of the shorter
physical-presence requirement to the unwed fathers that the
statute reserved for the unwed mothers. Id. The Court
expressly stated that it had the option of doing just that or
nullifying the benefit reserved for the unwed mothers such that
both classes of parents would have a longer physical presence
requirement. Id. Despite acknowledging that “extension,
rather than nullification, is the proper course” it chose
nullification because extension would have disrupted the
statutory scheme in a way that would have meant a shorter
physical-presence requirement for unwed fathers and mothers
than for their wed counterparts. Id. at 1700.

       To our case, then, the “proper course” is proper. Indeed,
we are confronted with the same two remedial alternatives: we
can remedy the unequal treatment by extending the benefit that
8 U.S.C. § 1432(a)(3) confers on unwed mothers to Felipe
Tineo or by nullifying the benefit such that the benefit-
conferring clause in (a)(3) is excised. We choose the former,
and our choice is “governed by the legislature’s intent, as




                              32
revealed by the statute at hand.” Morales-Santana, 137 S. Ct.
at 1699.

         Gleaning that the proper course is extension is rather
straightforward in this case. On the one hand, nothing supports
nullification. This is because in the face of nullification—that
is, the possibility that § 1101(c)(1) could be read as imposing
a legitimation requirement on mothers of children born out of
wedlock—Congress spoke in as clear a manner as it could. It
said “a child born outside of the United States of [noncitizen
parents] . . . becomes a citizen [upon the] . . . the naturalization
of the mother if the child was born out of wedlock and the
paternity of the child has not been established by legitimation
. . . .” § 1432(a)(3). Even in the absence of this provision, the
government has maintained that no such legitimation
requirement exists for mothers.              See Eligibility of
Unlegitimated Children for Derivative Citizenship, 27 O.L.C.
136 (2003); Memorandum of William Yates, Acting Assoc.
Dir., CIS, to Regional Directors, CIS (Sept. 26, 2003), 2003
WL 22334606, at *1.

        On the other, there is no roadblock to granting
extension. There is little support for the view that Congress
intended that no unlegitimated child born out of wedlock
would ever derive citizenship through her father. Even if it did,
its enactment of a severability provision counsels against
considering that conviction as so strong as to warrant depriving
similarly situated mothers of the benefit in order to implement
it. See The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 § 406, 66
Stat. 163, 281 (“If any particular provision of this Act, or the
application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held
invalid, the remainder of the Act and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be
affected thereby.” (emphases added)).




                                33
        In addition, contrary to the government’s suggestion,
Morales-Santana is no obstacle. The Court’s reluctance to
grant extension in Morales-Santana was driven by the fact that
it would result in ascribing a discriminatory intent to Congress:
that of “disadvantageous treatment of marital children in
comparison to nonmarital children.” 137 S. Ct. at 1700. There
is no argument that § 1101(c)(1)’s legitimation requirement
applies, or has ever applied, to the parents of children born in
wedlock. Thus, extending Felipe Tineo the same treatment that
§ 1432(a)(3) affords to similarly situated mothers would not
disrupt the statutory scheme in any significant way, nor will it
result in ascribing a discriminatory intent to Congress.

       So we will: Jose Francisco Tineo became a U.S. citizen
when his father naturalized and he was “under the age of
eighteen years” and “residing in the United States pursuant to
a lawful admission for permanent residence . . . .” See §
1432(a)(4) & (a)(5). That is since June 15, 1985.

                            *****

       We acknowledge that, like Morales-Santana before
him, Tineo does not engender much sympathy. He had other
options available to seek citizenship in his own right. See, e.g.,
8 U.S.C. § 1427. Although “[t]his option [might have] be[en]
foreclosed to [Tineo], [] any bar [would have been] due to the
serious nature of his criminal offenses, not to an equal
protection denial or to any supposed rigidity or harshness in the
citizenship laws.” Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 71.

       But he is not the Tineo that is our focus here. The result
fostered by the gender classification at issue precluded Felipe
Tineo from ever having his child derive citizenship from him.
No matter how we attain it, the Constitution guarantees us the




                               34
rights and responsibilities that come with American
citizenship, regardless of gender, religious beliefs, or the color
of our skin. See J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B., 511 U.S. 127,
146 (1994). Felipe Tineo acquired citizenship and lived out its
responsibilities, so we cannot lend our imprimatur to his being
unconstitutionally denied one of its benefits. This is the focus
of Jose Tineo’s challenge, and the lens through which we view
him an American.

        With this ruling, the consequence for Tineo’s offenses
is not removal, but rather what the law provides is permissible
for any other citizen who is convicted of the same offenses.
We will therefore grant the petition for review and vacate the
order of removal. This course obviates the need to reach
Tineo’s argument that the BIA should have found that his
passport established a presumption of citizenship that the
government may rebut only by showing that the passport was
fraudulently or illegally obtained. See Dessouki, 915 F.3d at
967 (citizenship finding mooted “lingering agency issues”).

SMITH, Chief Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in
part.
       When Felipe Tineo became a naturalized United
States citizen, he acquired all the rights that adhere to that
status. At the relevant time, this included the right to pass
his citizenship to his children under the circumstances
described in 8 U.S.C. § 1432.1 Because we address the
claim that Felipe Tineo would have been able to pass his
citizenship to his son José pursuant to § 1432 but for a
gender-based classification preventing it, I concur with the
majority that we apply intermediate scrutiny in conducting
our review.2 Sessions v. Morales-Santana, 137 S. Ct.
1678, 1689 (2017). Intermediate scrutiny requires that the

1
  For simplicity, I refer only to § 1432. However, as the
majority correctly observes, the gender-based
classification at issue arises from the interaction of two
subsections of § 1432 with the definition of “child” in 8
U.S.C. § 1101(c)(1).
2
  I likewise concur with the majority in its view that, to the
extent Catwell v. Attorney General, 623 F.3d 199, 211 (3d
Cir. 2010), applied rational basis review to a gender-based
equal protection challenge, we must decline to follow it in
light of the Supreme Court’s more recent decision in
Sessions v. Morales-Santana, 137 S. Ct. 1678, 1689
(2017).

                              1
gender-based classification serve an important
governmental objective and be substantially related to
achievement of that objective. Id. at 1690. I part ways
with the majority because, in my view, § 1432 satisfies
that standard.3
       The Government posits that § 1432 serves an
important governmental objective: as in Nguyen v. INS,
533 U.S. 53 (2001), the statute utilizes legitimation “as a
tailored means of ensuring that only those unwed fathers
who had achieved equal parental rights as those afforded
to mothers under the law of their state or country were
permitted to pass citizenship to their child.” Resp’t. Br.
35–36.

       Recently, in Morales-Santana, the Supreme Court
reaffirmed that it correctly decided Nguyen. In Nguyen,
the parental acknowledgement requirement served the
important interest of establishing “the parent’s filial tie to
the child.” Morales-Santana, 137 S. Ct. at 1694. The
Supreme Court described the parental acknowledgement
requirement as “a justifiable, easily met means of ensuring
the existence of a biological parent-child relationship,
which the mother establishes by giving birth.” Id.

3
 I further agree with the majority that, under United States
v. Moreno, 727 F.3d 255, 257 (3d Cir. 2013), Tineo’s first
passport does not constitute conclusive proof of
citizenship.
                             2
       Nguyen recognized two important interests that are
served in establishing the existence of such a filial tie: (1)
the importance of assuring the existence of a biological
father-child relationship; and (2) the importance of
developing a true interpersonal relationship between the
child and the citizen parent who, in turn, has ties to the
United States. Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 62–65. The
differential treatment of mothers and fathers is based upon
genuine differences at the time of the birth of a child, and
does not rely on outdated stereotypes. See Nguyen, 533
U.S. at 68 (“There is nothing irrational or improper in the
recognition that at the moment of birth . . . the mother’s
knowledge of the child and the fact of parenthood have
been established in a way not guaranteed in the case of the
unwed father. This is not a stereotype.”).

       The legitimation requirement in § 1432, like the
parental acknowledgment requirement in Nguyen, is
substantially related to the goal of ensuring that a
naturalized father’s citizenship passes automatically to his
child only in those cases where a genuine biological and
familial tie exists. “It is almost axiomatic that a policy
which seeks to foster the opportunity for meaningful
parent-child bonds to develop has a close and substantial
bearing on the governmental interest in the actual
formation of that bond.” Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 70. The fit
between the means and the important end is, as in Nguyen,
“exceedingly persuasive.” Id.

                              3
        Section 1432 is actually more difficult to satisfy
than the statute in Nguyen because § 1432 is limited to
legitimation under local law, while the statute in Nguyen
permitted paternal acknowledgment via two additional
methods (a court order of paternity or a declaration of
paternity under oath). See Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 70–71. In
my view, this does not change the conclusion that Nguyen
applies. Even if § 1432 had included the other alternatives
described in Nguyen, none of them would be available to
José Tineo because there is no evidence that his father
acknowledged paternity or adjudicated paternity before
José turned 18. Moreover, as observed in Nguyen, José
Tineo could have sought citizenship in his own right, were
it not for his having committed serious criminal offenses.
See Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 71.

       It need hardly be pointed out that we are not
permitted to override the will of Congress and select other
methods for designating the recipients of derivative
citizenship. Indeed, in Nguyen, the Supreme Court
rejected the suggestion that a DNA test should suffice,
observing that the “Constitution . . . does not require that
Congress elect one particular mechanism from among
many possible methods of establishing paternity.”
Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 63. Our review is limited to
consideration of whether Congress’s selection of state
legitimation law is substantially related to its goal of
establishing the existence of a true filial tie before

                             4
citizenship may pass from a father to his non-marital child.
As I see it, such a substantial relationship exists.
       The majority is swayed by the outcome that José
Tineo is forever barred from receiving derivative
citizenship via his naturalized father because his mother
died when José was 15, and the laws of the relevant
jurisdictions (New York and the Dominican Republic)
offered no method for Felipe to legitimate José after her
death. For that reason, the majority dismisses the
Government’s primary justification for the statute. But in
legislating, Congress is not required to anticipate every
potential outcome that results from the application of a
statute in order for it to pass constitutional muster. See
Pierre v. Holder, 738 F.3d 39, 53–54 (2d Cir. 2013).
Congress legislated in the “difficult context of conferring
citizenship on vast numbers of persons.” Nguyen, 533 U.S.
at 70. We should therefore accept the means Congress
chose, so long as it does so within the bounds of the
constitution by legislating “in substantial furtherance of
important governmental objectives.” See id. I believe its
chosen course meets that test.4


4
  In dismissing the government’s proffered justification,
the majority relies on decisions about the termination of
parental rights. In Lehr v. Robinson, 463 U.S. 248, 266–
68 (1983), for instance, the Supreme Court upheld a New
York law that prevented a biological father from vetoing
                             5
his daughter’s adoption by another man. Lehr, in turn,
cites Caban v. Mohammed, 441 U.S. 380, 389 (1979), a
case in which the Supreme Court rejected an earlier
version of the same New York statute because it too
broadly assumed that a father always has a lesser bond
than a mother. In Caban, the statute was structured in a
way that did not take into account the father’s relationship
with his biological child at all, and instead relied
exclusively on “overbroad generalizations” about a non-
marital father’s role. Id. at 394. Thus, Caban concerned
the sort of outdated gender stereotypes that do not underlie
the legislation before us today. And, after Caban, the New
York legislature amended the statute to provide methods
for an unwed father to establish the existence of a
relationship with his child. See Practice Commentary,
N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law § 111 (McKinney 2016). It was the
amended statute that survived scrutiny in Lehr.

Here, in contrast to Lehr and Caban, Congress was not
addressing the termination of parental rights in adoption,
but was legislating to ensure the existence of the father’s
filial tie for the specific purpose of passing on a citizenship
right. The Supreme Court spoke to this important interest
in Nguyen and upheld an analogous provision as
constitutional because it substantially served that
important interest. Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 67. In short, Lehr
and Caban arose in a distinct and distinguishable context
and do not undermine my conclusion that Nguyen controls.
                                6
       Equal protection does not require that “the statute
under consideration must be capable of achieving its
ultimate objective in every instance.” Id. Thus, although
the result in the case we confront is that José Tineo cannot
acquire derivative citizenship under § 1432, such an
outcome does not mean that his father was deprived of the
equal protection of the law.

      I therefore would deny the petition for review.

MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
BECKWITH, District Judge.

Background
This case is currently before the Court to consider several motions filed by the parties in this action. This matter arose when Suella Debolt filed a complaint against two private Defendants, the owner and management company of the housing project in which she resided, and against several federal Defendants, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Administrator, State Director, and a District Director of the Farmers Home Administration (hereinafter the "FmHA"). Following their settlement with the Plaintiff, the private Defendants were dismissed from this case in February of 1992. In her complaint, the Plaintiff contends that the FmHA's occupancy limits combined with the agency's administration of the Rural Rental Housing program produce a discriminatory impact on families with children.
Beginning in 1986, Ms. Debolt resided in the Village Green Apartments, a "Section 515" project. The FmHA administers a program called the Rural Rental Housing program or Section 515 program. Under Section 515, the FmHA administers the Section 515 program through loan programs and through project operations. The loan programs aid in the construction of rental housing for very low, low, or moderate income persons or families residing in rural areas experiencing a shortage of adequate housing. 42 U.S.C. § 1485. Ms. Debolt's lease contained a provision that limited the number of occupants in her apartment to four persons. In 1991, when Ms. Debolt gave birth to a fourth child, she was in violation of the lease's four person occupancy limit. Accordingly, the management of the Village Green Apartments notified Ms. Debolt that she was required to move at the end of her lease term.
However, as part of the settlement of the eviction action pending against her, Ms. Debolt stayed in her apartment for an additional year. Later, in December of 1991, Ms. Debolt had a fifth child and she was unable to find a larger unit in FmHA's Rural Rental Housing Program, so she moved in with relatives.
On September 30, 1992, this Court granted the Plaintiffs' motion to certify this matter as a class action pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Accordingly, the Plaintiff class has been certified as:

*212 all persons who either are or would be eligible to reside, or to continue to reside within a project financed under FmHA's Section 515 Rural Rental Housing Program, but for the fact that their family size exceeds that permitted to reside in a two bedroom apartment under FmHA's occupancy standards.
The Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint pleads a class action challenging the promulgation and enforcement of an FmHA regulation, 7 C.F.R. § 1944.553, as conflicting with 42 U.S.C. §§ 1471, 1480, and 1485. The Plaintiffs argue that § 1944.553 was promulgated in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (hereinafter the "APA"). The Plaintiffs also argue that the Defendants improperly administer the Section 515 programs in the State of Ohio. The Plaintiffs assert that the Defendants have a duty to review and disapprove non-complying termination notices to tenants, but that they have failed to do so. The Plaintiffs also assert that the Defendants have approved a model rental agreement which does not provide for a yearly rental term. The Plaintiffs also allege that these federal officials failed to administer the Section 515 program to meet the needs of eligible families. The Plaintiffs specifically assert that this improper administration arbitrarily and unlawfully denies or terminates eligibility for financially eligible tenants and applicant families needing more than two bedrooms under FmHA's restrictive occupancy limits. The Plaintiffs further allege that these occupancy limits, along with the Defendants' improper administration, produce a discriminatory and unlawful disparate impact upon families with children, in violation of the Fair Housing Act.

The Federal Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
The federal Defendants have filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In their motion, the federal Defendants assert that this Court is without jurisdiction to adjudicate the Plaintiffs' claims, except for those claims contained in Count 5 of the Plaintiffs' complaint. The federal Defendants first contend that Counts 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The federal Defendants also contend that the Plaintiffs have no private right of action under either the United States Housing Act of 1949 (hereinafter "USHA") or the Fair Housing Act, if sovereign immunity has been waived. The federal Defendants finally argue that the Plaintiffs lack standing to assert their claims that FmHA must finance rental housing units of a particular size.
However, the Plaintiffs argue that their claims are not barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity as the law is allegedly well settled that statutory and constitutional claims for equitable relief are not barred by sovereign immunity. Also, the Plaintiffs argue that their claims for individual damages and attorney fees under Title VIII are not barred by sovereign immunity, since such immunity was waived by Congress.
Under the Administrative Procedure Act, Title 5 Section 702 provides, in part:
... An action in a court of the United States seeking relief other than money damages and stating a claim that an agency or an officer or employee thereof acted or failed to act in an official capacity or under color of legal authority shall not be dismissed nor relief therein be denied on the ground that it is against the United States or that the United States is an indispensable party.
Thus, Section 702[1] of the APA acts to waive sovereign immunity for the Plaintiffs' USHA and constitutional claims. However, in their complaint, the Plaintiffs have only asserted one of their eight remaining claims under the APA. After a careful review of the authorities and arguments advanced by the parties in their memoranda, *213 this Court finds that it agrees with the federal Defendants that all of the Plaintiffs' claims should be asserted under the APA. Accordingly, the next question is whether the Plaintiffs should be given leave to amend their complaint to assert their claims under the APA. The federal Defendants argue that the Plaintiffs should not be given leave to amend their complaint in this case to invoke the Administrative Procedure Act, since the litigation has been pending for more two years. However, the Court notes that the federal Defendants did not raise this issue until they filed this motion for judgment on the pleadings. The first mention of this issue was contained in the federal Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings which was filed almost two years after the institution of the case.
The Court first notes the rationale expressed by Judge Whipple of the Western District of Missouri in the case of Tinsley v. Kemp, 750 F.Supp. 1001 (W.D.Mo.1990). In Tinsley, Judge Whipple stated, in part:
The intent of the complaint is obvious, so the amendment would be almost a formality. Nevertheless, plaintiffs' basis for bringing civil rights claims against a federal agency should be established explicitly in their complaint. Accordingly, leave will be granted to amend the complaint.
Id. at 1010. In another case, Judge Haight of the Southern District of New York allowed plaintiffs to amend their complaint to invoke the Administrative Procedure Act. Almonte v. Pierce, 666 F.Supp. 517, 524-5 (S.D.N.Y. 1987). In Almonte, Judge Haight noted that the case was at the early stage of litigation and that the federal Defendants had not demonstrated that any prejudice would result from allowing the plaintiffs to amend their complaint. Id. at 525.
In this case, the federal Defendants have not established that any specific prejudice would result from allowing the Plaintiffs to amend their complaint at this late date. The federal Defendants do allege that "voluminous" discovery has occurred in this case, although they do not allege how a technical amendment to the Plaintiffs' complaint would affect whatever discovery has already occurred in this case. The Court simply can not infer that prejudice would result from an amendment which is "almost a formality." See, 750 F.Supp. at 1010. Moreover, Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that "leave [to amend] shall be freely given when justice so requires." As in Tinsley, the Plaintiffs' intent as expressed by their complaint is evident, and the amendment in this case is thus a mere formality. Under the circumstances presented by this case, the Court finds that justice mandates that the Plaintiffs be given leave to amend their complaint. The Court hereby DEEMS the Plaintiffs' complaint to be amended so that their claims are now asserted under the Administrative Procedure Act. The federal Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings is hereby DENIED.[2]

The Motions for Summary Judgment Standard of Review
Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides:
[Summary judgment] ... shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
The purpose of a summary judgment motion is not to resolve factual issues, but to determine if there are genuine issues of fact to be tried. Lashlee v. Sumner, 570 F.2d 107, 111 (6th Cir.1978).
In 1986, the United States Supreme Court issued three decisions which gave new life to Rule 56 as a mechanism for weeding out certain claims at the summary judgment stage. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). It is well recognized *214 that these cases brought about a "new era" in summary judgment practice. Street v. J.C. Bradford & Co., 886 F.2d 1472, 1476 (6th Cir.1989). The three opinions by the Supreme Court reflect a return to the original purpose of the summary judgment motion. Id.
Accordingly, the summary judgment "standard provides that the mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247-8, 106 S.Ct. at 2510 (emphasis in original). Moreover, when a party cannot establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case on which the party will have the burden of proof at trial, the Court must enter summary judgment against that party, pursuant to Rule 56. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. at 2552. Thus, in order to survive a motion for summary judgment,
[w]hen the moving party has carried its burden under Rule 56(c), its opponent must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.... In the language of the Rule, the nonmoving party must come forward with "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial."
Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 586-87, 106 S.Ct. at 1356 (emphasis in the original) (footnote and citations omitted).
Rule 56(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides:
When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party's pleading, but the adverse party's response by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If the adverse party does not so respond, summary judgment if appropriate, shall be entered against the adverse party.
Accordingly, mere allegations are not sufficient to defeat summary judgment. The Court can now apply this standard to the Plaintiffs' and the federal Defendants' motions for summary judgment.

The Federal Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment
The federal Defendants first contend that neither the United States Housing Act of 1949 ("USHA") nor the Fair Housing Act commands the FmHA to finance construction of additional three and four bedroom units or to dictate to private developers that they must build such units. Since no three bedroom apartments were available for Ms. Debolt when her family size increased to five, the Plaintiffs assert that the FmHA through its improper administration has violated Ms. Debolt's rights under the USHA, Section 515 of USHA, and the Fair Housing Act. However, the Plaintiffs have not indicated exactly what statutory directive supports these alleged rights.
The Court has already determined that the Plaintiffs' claims are reviewable solely under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 551 et seq. Pursuant to the APA, the FmHA's administration of the Rural Rental Housing Program may only be set aside if it is "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law; ... [or] in excess of statutory right...." 5 U.S.C. § 706; Jaimes v. Toledo Metropolitan Housing Authority, 715 F.Supp. 835, 839 (N.D.Ohio 1989).
The Court first notes that pursuant to Section 515 of the Rural Rental Housing program, the FmHA is authorized to utilize its discretion in its financing of elderly, family or handicapped housing. 42 U.S.C. § 1485. The Court agrees with the federal Defendants that the FmHA is not required to finance any particular proportion of each type of housing. Moreover, the Court agrees with the federal Defendants that the provisions cited by the federal Defendants in their memoranda support their argument that it was Congress' intention that the private sector take an active role in meeting the nation's housing needs.
Additionally, the federal Defendants argue that the familial status provision of the Fair Housing Act does not require the FmHA to *215 finance, or private developers to construct, housing for large families. On the other hand, the Plaintiffs argue that the Fair Housing Act obligates the FmHA to evaluate and consider the impact of proposed housing on existing discriminatory housing patterns, to refrain from approving housing that reinforces those patterns, and to affirmatively promote non-discriminatory housing, relying on Jaimes v. Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority, 833 F.2d 1203 (6th Cir.1987); and Garrett v. Hamtramck, 503 F.2d 1236 (6th Cir.1974).
In 1988, Congress passed the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 which amended the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which is located in 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3631. The Fair Housing Act is also referred to as Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. Pursuant to Title VIII, discriminatory housing practices based on race, color, national origin, religion, and sex are prohibited. The 1988 Amendments added "familial status" as a protected category with respect to discriminatory housing practices. The Court notes that as opposed to families in general, "large families" are not a specifically protected class under Title VIII. Indeed, the Court notes that in this case Ms. Debolt did not violate her lease and receive an eviction notice until the birth of her fourth child. Accordingly, Ms. Debolt resided in the apartment with children for some length of time before she violated the four person occupancy limit.
The Court finds that the Plaintiffs' position here is not supported by the Fair Housing Act, the legislative history of the Act, the administrative interpretation of the Act by the Secretary of HUD, and the relevant case law. Indeed, the Plaintiffs simply have no right to public housing, and the FmHA is not obligated to finance or to compel private developers to build large apartment units. See, Citizens Comm. for Faraday Wood v. Lindsay, 507 F.2d 1065, 1070-71 (2d Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 948, 95 S.Ct. 1679, 44 L.Ed.2d 102 (1975); Mahaley v. Cuyahoga Metro. Housing Authority, 500 F.2d 1087, 1093 (6th Cir.1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1108, 95 S.Ct. 781, 42 L.Ed.2d 805 (1975).
The federal Defendants also contend that the Secretary's regulations effectuate the policies and purposes of the Rural Rental Housing Program and the Fair Housing Act. The Plaintiffs contend that the FmHA's duties under the Act are found in the case law interpreting Section 3608. The federal Defendants concede that Section 3608(d) is applicable to the various FmHA programs. The Plaintiffs' complaint here focuses on alleged "improper administration" of the Rural Rental Housing Program by the FmHA. The Plaintiffs' claims here originate because Ms. Debolt was not able to obtain a larger, FmHA subsidized apartment and because as many as 15% of eligible families are not able to obtain such housing. In this area, the Plaintiffs' claims are governed by the narrow scrutiny of Section 3608 and the Administrative Procedure Act. See, N.A.A.C.P. v. Secretary of Housing & Urban Dev., 817 F.2d 149, 157-58 (1st Cir.1987).
Section 3608(d) of Title VIII provides that the FmHA "shall administer [its] programs and activities relating to housing ... in a manner affirmatively to further the purposes of [the Fair Housing Act]." 42 U.S.C. § 3608(d). The Court finds that the Plaintiff has not presented any evidence that demonstrates that the FmHA acted arbitrarily in deciding its obligations under Section 3608.
Additionally, the federal Defendants contend that no equal protection violations occurred in this case, since the FmHA's actions were rationally related to the USHA's legitimate purpose. The federal Defendants have demonstrated that the existing stock of housing is the product of a rational, market-based process. The Plaintiffs have not presented evidence to the contrary.
Moreover, the federal Defendants assert that the Plaintiffs' allegations do not rise to the level of a substantive due process violation. In support of this claim, the Court finds that the Plaintiffs have not presented any evidence that supports the extremely high standard of proof required for a substantive due process claim.
Also, the federal Defendants argue that the Plaintiffs' claim against the FmHA as a third party beneficiary must be dismissed, *216 since the Plaintiffs have no actionable rights as a third-party beneficiary. The Plaintiffs claim that the "financial, contractual and fiduciary relationship" with respect to the operation of the Village Green Apartments gives rise to certain third party beneficiary rights, and that these rights were violated. The federal Defendants assert that the Plaintiffs have failed to identify any particular contractual arrangement which would give rise to her rights as an alleged third party beneficiary.
The courts have generally concluded that tenants are not third-party beneficiaries to regulatory agreements under the USHA. See, e.g., Perry v. Housing Authority of City of Charleston, 664 F.2d 1210, 1218 (4th Cir. 1981); Falzarano v. United States, 607 F.2d 506, 511 (1st Cir.1979); Angleton v. Pierce, 574 F.Supp. 719, 735-6 (D.N.J.1983), aff'd, 734 F.2d 3 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 880, 105 S.Ct. 245, 83 L.Ed.2d 183 (1984); Carson v. Pierce, 546 F.Supp. 80, 86-7 (E.D.Mo.1982), aff'd, 719 F.2d 931 (8th Cir. 1983). Thus, the Court finds that the Plaintiffs have no actionable rights as third-party beneficiaries with respect to the operation of the Village Green Apartments.
The federal Defendants also argue that the Plaintiffs cannot establish that FmHA failed to review her notice of eviction and that such a failure violated her rights. The Plaintiffs' claim here appears to be that the FmHA failed to meet its regulatory duty to disapprove legally deficient eviction notices utilized by borrowers and landlords.
The Court notes first that the Plaintiffs have not asserted that the FmHA failed to review the particular eviction notice that was served upon Ms. Debolt. Thus, it appears to the Court that the Plaintiffs lack standing on this issue. See, Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2140, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992).
The federal Defendants also argue that the Plaintiffs have procedural safeguards with respect to eviction notices under Ohio landlord-tenant law. The Court finds that the existence of this procedural safeguard removes the potential of a due process violation arising from the FmHA's failure to review the eviction notices.
Additionally, the federal Defendants assert that the Plaintiffs' claims concerning FmHA's model lease terms are moot. The Plaintiffs assert that the FmHA's model lease violated both the USHA and the APA. The Plaintiffs argument is that the month-to-month renewal term allowed by the Ohio model lease violates USHA's regulations which mandate that "[l]eases for units for which tenants are eligible must cover a period of one year...." 7 C.F.R. Ch. XVIII Pt. 1930, Subpt. C., Exh. B at par. VIII(A)(1).
On August 28, 1992, the director of FmHA's Ohio office issued Administrative Notice 956, that contained a new form of model lease that provided for rental terms of one year. Accordingly, the Court finds that the Plaintiffs' claim regarding the month-to-month rental term is now moot.
As it has determined that the federal Defendants' motion for summary judgment is meritorious, the Court need not discuss why it has concluded that the Plaintiffs' two motions for summary judgment lack merit.

Conclusion
For the reasons outlined above, the Court hereby DENIES the Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings. The Court hereby DEEMS the Plaintiffs' complaint to be amended so that their claims are asserted under the Administrative Procedures Act.
For the reasons outlined above and for the reasons stated by the federal Defendants in their memoranda, the Court hereby GRANTS the federal Defendants' motion for summary judgment, and this case is hereby DISMISSED.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
NOTES
[1]  Under the APA, the judicial scope of review has been established by Section 706. Section 706 provides, in part, that a reviewing court shall "hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be (a) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (b) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege or immunity; (c) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations or short of statutory right; (d) without observance of procedure by law...."

204 Va. 316 (1963)
LESTER POLLARD
v.
ELIZABETH SMITH POLLARD.
Record No. 5548.
Supreme Court of Virginia.
April 22, 1963.
William Davis Butts,    on brief for the appellant.
Present, All the Justices.
Lester Pollard's bill for divorce on the ground of wilful desertion by his wife Elizabeth Pollard was dismissed because it was shown that she became and was adjudged insane after the date of the alleged desertion.  The evidence showed the desertion without cause on January 28, 1947; the adjudication of insanity on February 26, 1947; and that defendant had given no indication of insanity prior to the date of the desertion.  On this evidence it was error to refuse the divorce.  Code 1950, section 20-93, changes the prior rule of the cases in such situations and expressly states that insanity so occurring is no defense to a bill for divorce by the deserted spouse.
Appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court of the city of Hampton.  Hon. Frnk A. Kearney, judge presiding. The opinion states the case.
William Alfred Smith,    on brief for the appellee.
Case submitted on briefs.
CARRICO
CARRICO, J., delivered the opinion of the court.
In this divorce case we are, for the first time, presented the question of the application of Code, | 20-93, the pertinent provisions of which are as follows:
"Insanity of guilty party after commencement of desertion no defense. -- When the suit is for divorce from the bond of matrimony for wilful desertion or abandonment, it shall be no defense that the *317 guilty party has, since the commencement of such desertion, and within one year thereafter, become and has been adjudged insane, but at the expiration of one year from the commencement of such desertion the ground for divorce shall be deemed to be complete.  . . ."
The question here presented arises from an appeal granted Lester Pollard, the complainant, from a final decree dismissing his bill of complaint for divorce, alleging wilful desertion and abandonment, filed against Elizabeth Smith Pollard, the defendant.  The bill was dismissed because it was shown that the defendant had been adjudged insane subsequent to the date of the alleged desertion and prior to the expiration of one year from such date.
The bill alleged, and the evidence showed, that the Pollards were married on April 19, 1941; that they lived together for six years, during which time the complainant was a dutiful husband; that the defendant deserted the complainant on January 28, 1947, without just cause or excuse; that the desertion had continued uninterrupted since that date; that on February 26, 1947, the defendant was adjudged insane and was committed to Central State Hospital at Petersburg, where she was still confined when the case was heard.  The evidence further showed that the defendant displayed no signs of mental illness at the time she left the complainant on January 28, 1947.
Prior to the enactment, in 1926, of what is now Code, | 20-93, it was the law in this state that when a defendant in a divorce case became and was adjudged insane between the date of desertion and the running of the statutory period prescribed to make the ground for divorce complete, such insanity was a bar to the granting of a divorce.  We had so held in    Wright     Wright, 125 Va. 526, 99 S.E. 515, decided June 12, 1919, where it was stated that the reason for the rule was that, "an insane person is incapable of forming the intent, either to continue the desertion or to seek a reconciliation."  125 Va., at pp. 528, 529.
In the    Wright    case, Judge Prentis conceded that the rule there enunciated would, in some cases, cause undue hardship.  He said, however, that, "[if] there be hardship, the question is one of public policy for the consideration of the General Assembly."  125 Va., at p. 529.
The legislature, perhaps motivated by the cases of hardship pointed to by Judge Prentis but, in any event, in sound consideration of public policy, saw fit to change the rule adopted in the    Wright    case.  In *318 clear and unambiguous language it provided that insanity, occurring between the commencement of desertion and the running of the statutory period, is not a bar to divorce for wilful desertion or abandonment.  A defense based upon such insanity, previously provided by judicial rule was, by legislative rule, declared no longer to exist.  Now, when desertion occurs and continues uninterrupted for one year the ground of divorce is complete, notwithstanding that the defendant meanwhile has become and has been adjudged insane.
It is the duty of the courts to recognize and give effect to such a legislative rule.  In the case before us, the evidence was sufficient to sustain the complainant's ground for divorce, and it was error to refuse him a decree because the defendant became and was adjudged insane in the one-year period following the desertion.  Accordingly, the decree will be reversed and the cause remanded with direction to enter a decree awarding the complainant a divorce from the defendant for wilful desertion and abandonment for more than one year.
Reversed and remanded.

Before ROBINSON, WILKEY and GINSBURG, Circuit Judges.
Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge GINSBURG.
GINSBURG, Circuit Judge:


1
Defendants Gibson and Hagans appeal from a conviction for possession of heroin with intent to distribute.  The appeal raises four issues: the legality of two searches conducted at the time of arrest and the propriety of two evidentiary rulings made by the district court.

I. Facts

2
Officer Haskins, an officer regularly assigned to narcotics investigations, was stationed at a third floor window of an apartment building in an area where residents had complained about narcotics transactions.  He observed a Cadillac Seville carrying four persons pull into a parking lot adjoining the building and park "almost right up against the building."  Transcript at 14.  Haskins estimated that he was between thirty and forty-five feet from the occupants of the car.  Using binoculars, Haskins observed this sequence of activity: defendant Gibson, seated in the driver's seat, counted out numerous glassine packets containing a white substance; defendant Hagans, seated behind Gibson, passed Gibson a sum of money; Gibson put most of the money and one of the packets into a black purse and gave the remaining money and packets to Hagans; Gibson then placed the black purse between the armrests of the front seat of the car.


3
Shortly thereafter, Haskins, joined by back-up officers, approached the car, identified himself, and ordered the four occupants from the car.1 While other officers held Gibson and searched Hagans, Haskins took the black purse from the car.  He opened it and found $1325 and two packets of white powder, later identified as heroin. After arresting Gibson and Hagans, Haskins searched the trunk of the car and found a "partially opened" brown paper bag.  Transcript at 32.  He opened the bag further and removed from it two large vials of preludin pills.  Meanwhile, officers had found sixteen packets of heroin and $60 on defendant Hagans and $561 on defendant Gibson.


4
The government charged Gibson and Hagans with possession of heroin and Gibson with possession of the preludin pills.  The defendants moved to suppress the evidence found in the black purse and paper bag.  After the district court denied the motion, the defendants agreed to a stipulated trial without a jury.  The government in turn dismissed all charges except the charge of possession of heroin with intent to distribute.  The district court found both defendants guilty of that charge.

II. Fourth Amendment Issues

5
Defendants attack the searches of both the black purse and the paper bag.  Since the contents of the paper bag related solely to the charge against Gibson that was dismissed, we need not address the legality of that search.  The two vials of preludin pills could not have contributed to the defendants' convictions for heroin possession.  Thus the failure to suppress, even if erroneous, was not prejudicial.


6
Seizure of the black purse from the car was permissible under the automobile exception to the warrant requirement.  Under Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U.S. 42, 90 S.Ct. 1975, 26 L.Ed.2d 419 (1970), and our own decision in United States v. Hawkins, 595 F.2d 751 (D.C.Cir.1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 910, 99 S.Ct. 2005, 60 L.Ed.2d 380 (1979), the police could choose either to detain the car while seeking a warrant or to search the car immediately.


7
Defendants argue, however, that once the purse was seized, Arkansas v. Sanders, 442 U.S. 753, 99 S.Ct. 2586, 61 L.Ed.2d 235 (1979), mandated a warrant prior to police search of the purse's interior.  We pretermit that argument, because the search was justified on other grounds.  Officer Haskins testified that he observed Gibson putting packets containing a white substance into the black purse.  This observation, we conclude, brings the case within the court's "plain view" holding in United States v. Johnson, 561 F.2d 832 (D.C.Cir.)  (en banc ), cert. denied, 432 U.S. 907, 97 S.Ct. 2953, 53 L.Ed.2d 1080 (1977).


8
As a threshold matter, we note that Officer Haskins' use of binoculars to observe the activity in the car did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  The car in which defendants were observed was parked in an open lot alongside an apartment building.  Anyone happening along the street could have glanced into the car and observed the narcotics transaction.2 A person at any of the windows on the side of the building at which Officer Haskins was stationed might have looked into the car.3 Situated as they were, the defendants "had no right to assume that law enforcement officers would not enhance their ability to see ... them by use of various artificial means such as binoculars."  United States v. Moore, 562 F.2d 106, 112 (1st Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 926, 98 S.Ct. 1493, 55 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978).  See United States v. Powell, 638 F.2d 71, (9th Cir. 1979) (amended Jan. 29, 1980) (upholding a conviction based in part on the actions of an officer who, standing 20-25 yards from a truck, used binoculars to peer into the truck).4


9
Officer Haskins' lawful observation of Gibson placing glassine packets in the black purse, and the police action taken within minutes thereafter make the instant case clearer than the one the court confronted en banc in Johnson, supra.  There, a police officer, peering through the basement window of a residence, saw three men seated at a table holding narcotics paraphernalia and "a pyramid of white powder eight to ten inches high." 561 F.2d at 835.  The officer returned forty minutes later with other officers and entered the house without a warrant.  The three men were arrested, but the narcotics were no longer in sight.  The officers thereupon searched the basement and eventually found bundles of narcotics between mattresses on a bed and in a canvas bag concealed in an old rug.  The en banc opinion in Johnson concentrated on the questions whether the officer was trespassing when he looked through the basement window and whether, since there was a forty minute delay before entering the house, the officers should have obtained a warrant.  Resolving those questions against the defendants, Judge McGowan, writing for the court, turned finally to the warrantless search of the basement.  He reasoned that "the police ha(ving) seen a crime actually in progress with contraband in plain view ... they were fully authorized both to make arrests and to seek out the contraband."  Id. at 844.  Thus the search power could be "viewed as incident to arrest, or as deriving independently from the initial observation of the contraband."  Id. at 845.


10
The instant case presents neither of the features that made Johnson problematic.  No considerable time span separated the sighting of the packets from the search.  Rather, the search followed on the heels of the observation.  No extensive quest was involved.  Officer Haskins proceeded at once to the place where the packets rested.5 In sum, guided as we are by the Johnson opinion, we find no error in the failure to suppress the evidence found in the black purse.

III. Evidentiary Rulings

11
Defendant Hagans attacks two of the district court's evidentiary rulings; both challenges are meritless.


12
First, Hagans complains that Larry Kenan, a lay witness for defendants, was not allowed to testify that in his opinion he could not have seen into the interior of the car if he had been standing at a second story window using binoculars.  Kenan and defendant Gibson had attempted to recreate the circumstances surrounding the arrest in an effort to show that Officer Haskins could not have seen into the car carrying Gibson and Hagans.  The two went to a second story window of the building in which Haskins had been stationed, made observations, and took pictures.  They did not, however, take along binoculars.  Kenan was allowed to testify about what he saw during the experiment but he was not allowed to speculate about what he might have seen if he had used binoculars.  This was not error.  While a lay witness may offer opinion testimony when that testimony will be helpful to the trier of fact, Fed.R.Evid. 701, we know of no case holding that a trial judge must permit a lay witness to use one set of observations as the foundation for an opinion about what he might have seen under different circumstances.


13
Second, Hagans argues that the district court improperly excluded an advertising brochure displaying a Cadillac Seville.  The brochure was offered to buttress the defendants' theory that Officer Haskins could not have seen into the car.  The district court found, however, that the car portrayed in the brochure differed in a material respect from the car in which Gibson and Hagans were found.  The district court did allow the defendants to introduce photographs of the actual car involved in the episode, photographs Gibson had taken at the scene of the arrest.  In view of the district court's "wide discretion to admit or exclude evidence where the question is one of relevancy or materiality," United States v. Morgan, 581 F.2d 933, 936 (D.C.Cir.1978), we find no error in the ruling excluding the brochure.

Conclusion

14
The items seized from the black purse were in "plain view" of the arresting officer; therefore they were properly allowed into evidence.  No other alleged error called to our attention warrants reversal of the convictions.  Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is


15
Affirmed.

ERROL JOE KAMPSCHROEDER, Appellee,
v.
NORMA W. KAMPSCHROEDER and SHERRYL HOLMES, Appellants.
No. 71,720
Court of Appeals of Kansas.
Opinion filed January 6, 1995.
Gerald L. Cooley, John M. Cooley, and Randall F. Larkin, of Allen, Cooley & Allen, of Lawrence, for appellant Norma W. Kampschroeder.
Stephen M. Fletcher, of Overland Park, for appellant Sherryl Holmes.
Byron E. Springer, of Barber, Emerson, Springer, Zinn & Murray, L.C., of Lawrence, for appellee.
Before GERNON, P.J., ELLIOTT and LEWIS, JJ.
LEWIS, J.:
Errol Joe Kampschroeder was born to the marriage of Robert and Waneta Kampschroeder. Waneta died in April *362 1980, and Robert married Norma in October 1980. The marriage was not accepted well by Errol Joe and appears to have affected the relationship between the parties from that point on.
Robert and Norma remained married until Robert's death in 1990. Upon Robert's death, most of his and Norma's assets were held in joint tenancy with the right of survivorship. Norma placed these assets in her own name and the name of Sherryl Holmes, her daughter. Errol Joe commenced the present action to impose a constructive trust on the jointly held assets. The trial court held in favor of Errol Joe, and Norma and Sherryl appeal.
We affirm the decision of the trial court.
Litigation of this nature is particularly fact driven. The facts in this case are not, unfortunately, unusual. This lawsuit is between a stepson and his stepmother over property owned by the son's father and stepmother's husband at the time of his death. There was an extensive trial, and the trial court made 32 detailed findings of fact. We have reviewed the record and conclude that all of the trial court's findings of fact are supported by substantial competent evidence.
After hearing all the evidence, the trial court held that Norma and Robert agreed, for the convenience of the parties, to hold most of their assets in joint tenancy. This was to allow the properties accumulated by both parties or brought into the marriage by both parties to become the property of their heirs after their death. They intended that "the properties of Robert go to Errol and the properties of Norma go to Sherryl." Although we concede that a different spin might have been put on the evidence, the analysis adopted by the trial court is substantially supported by the record.
The trial court found five significant factors in reaching its conclusions:
"a. The Antenuptial Agreement showed their original intentions to keep their property separate.
"b. Robert's attitude toward Sherryl's son was emphatic that he not receive any of Robert's property and was certainly corroborative of their intent that the properties of Robert go to Errol, and the properties of Norma go to Sherryl.
"c. Clearly, the taped conversation of Norma and Nancy corroborates the testimony and position of the Plaintiff. Norma's testimony that she wanted to *363 be fair did not refer to her deciding whether commingled property should be separated because that had already been decided by the parties. That was clear by their intent as indicated on the taped conversation. When Norma indicated she wanted to be fair it is clear from the testimony she was overwhelmed by the process of having to separate the property out, of deciding just what was hers and what was Robert's, and thus would be Errol's.
"d. Robert's comment: `Make certain that Norma will be cared for' is not the language or the statement of a man who was leaving his entire estate of some worth to his wife. The fact that he wanted to make certain Norma was cared for indicated to me on his part a confusion as to what the wills would be.
"e. Norma's comment: `This will is no good,' certainly again corroborates the testimony or the position that this was  indeed, the intentions of the parties was to make certain that what was Robert's went to Errol, and what was Norma's went to Sherryl."
Once again, the analysis of the trial court is well within the evidence shown. The five factors cited by the trial court are clearly supported by substantial competent evidence. In the final analysis, the trial court concluded that the parties had entered into an understanding where each was to have the use of the income from the property of the other until their death, at which time the property would go to their respective children. This understanding formed the basis for the consideration of the agreement.
The trial court went on to conclude:
"Plaintiff has by clear and convincing standards shown that there was an agreement entered into, and, in fact, always understood by Norma and Robert, that upon the death of the first to die, the income from the property brought into the marriage by that person would be enjoyed by the surviving spouse, and then pass on to the children of Norma or Robert, depending upon the situation."
This conclusion is consistent with the trial court's findings of fact. Norma had breached this understanding, which gave rise to the constructive trust imposed.
The trial court went on to determine which assets were subjected to the constructive trust. The total value of those assets is $323,233.11. The constructive trust is such that Norma is to receive the income from these assets until her death, at which time they are to be paid to Errol Joe.
In appellants' brief is the following statement: "While defendants admit that the trial court's findings of fact are supported by substantial competent evidence in the record, defendants deny *364 that those findings of fact support the trial court's conclusions of law or its judgment." During oral argument before this court, counsel for Norma conceded that the trial court's findings of fact were supported by substantial competent evidence. On the other hand, counsel for Sherryl was unwilling to make such a concession. The problem with Sherryl's position is that her attorney did not file a separate brief. He joined in a single brief filed by the attorney for Norma. Sherryl is not in a position to contradict admissions made in the brief filed.
However, we have examined the record, and we conclude that the findings of fact are supported by substantial competent evidence.
An oral trust must be proved by clear and convincing evidence. Wehking v. Wehking, 213 Kan. 551, 554, 516 P.2d 1018 (1973). Upon review, we operate under the assumption that the trial court applied the correct standard of proof and was satisfied with the quantum of evidence introduced.
A constructive trust arises "`wherever the circumstances under which the property was acquired make it inequitable that it should be retained by the person who holds the legal title.'" Hile v. DeVries, 17 Kan. App.2d 373, 374, 836 P.2d 1219 (1992) (quoting Clester v. Clester, 90 Kan. 638, 642, 135 Pac. 996 [1914]).
An essential element of proving a constructive trust is a showing of fraud. However, there are two types of fraud, actual and constructive.
"Actual fraud is an intentional fraud, and the intent to deceive is an essential element of the action. Constructive fraud, however, is a breach of a legal or equitable duty which, irrespective of moral guilt, the law declares fraudulent because of its tendency to deceive others or violate a confidence, and neither actual dishonesty of purpose or intent to deceive is necessary. [Citation omitted.]" Moore v. State Bank of Burden, 240 Kan. 382, 389, 729 P.2d 1205 (1986), cert. denied 482 U.S. 906 (1987).
In the context in which this issue is presented, we are not dealing with actual dishonesty of purpose or intent to deceive. The evidence indicates Norma was guilty of a breach of duty amounting to constructive fraud.
Absent actual fraud, there are two additional elements which are required to be proven. First, there must be a confidential *365 relationship. Secondly, the confidence reposed must be betrayed, or a duty imposed by the relationship must be breached. See Winsor v. Powell, 209 Kan. 292, 302-03, 497 P.2d 292 (1972).
A confidential relationship is not presumed, and the burden of proving such a relationship existed rests upon the party asserting its existence. Paul v. Smith, 191 Kan. 163, Syl. ¶ 4, 380 P.2d 421 (1963). The mere fact that a transfer of property occurs between a husband and wife and no valuable consideration passes is not sufficient to raise a trust by implication. Clester v. Clester, 90 Kan. 638, 641, 135 Pac. 996 (1914).
Under the facts shown, Errol Joe seeks to impress a trust on property which Norma owns by virtue of a joint tenancy contract with Robert. There is no question but that the property held in joint tenancy may be the subject of a trust. Wehking v. Wehking, 213 Kan. 551, Syl. ¶ 2; Winsor v. Powell, 209 Kan. at 300.
The facts of this case are strikingly similar to those in Winsor v. Powell. In that action, the decedent, when discussing his affairs, spoke of his daughter, Sarah, and said, "`She'll do the right thing.'" 209 Kan. at 301. In this action, Robert told Errol Joe that he had $350,000, that Norma would be fair, and that Errol Joe could trust her. Robert told Errol Joe that Norma was to get the interest and, upon her death, Errol Joe was to get the principal. In addition, Norma acknowledged to Errol Joe's wife the necessity of her separating Robert's assets from her own. These facts in Winsor v. Powell were held sufficient to raise a constructive trust, and they are equally sufficient in this action.
Norma and Sherryl argue that the agreement found by the court was not proven by clear and convincing evidence.
"To be clear and satisfactory, evidence should be `clear' in the sense that it is certain, plain to the understanding, and unambiguous, and `satisfactory' in the sense that it is so believable that persons of ordinary intelligence, discretion, and caution may have confidence in it. Clear and satisfactory evidence is not a quantum of proof, but a quality of proof." Barbara Oil Co. v. Kansas Gas Supply Corp., 250 Kan. 438, Syl. ¶ 7, 827 P.2d 24 (1992).
Norma and Sherryl suggest that there was no direct evidence of an agreement between Robert and Norma. However, we note that in the recorded conversation between Norma and Errol Joe's *366 wife, Norma acknowledges the existence of some understanding between her and Robert and indicates that in order to carry out that understanding, she must separate Robert's assets from her own. We consider this to be direct evidence of the existence of an agreement. Indeed, circumstantial evidence may be used to prove the existence of an agreement. Staab v. Staab, 160 Kan. 417, 419, 163 P.2d 418 (1945).
Earlier in this opinion, we enumerated the five significant factors relied on by the court in reaching its conclusion. Norma and Sherryl argue that these factors do not show by clear and convincing standards that an agreement existed.
We do not review for the quantum of evidence, but rather the quality. "On review, this court considers only the evidence of the successful party to determine whether it is substantial and whether it is of a clear and convincing quality. See Newell v. Krause, 239 Kan. 550, 557, 722 P.2d 530 (1986)." Barbara Oil Co. v. Kansas Gas Supply Corp., 250 Kan. at 448.
As we review the evidence in light of our standard of review, we conclude that each of the five factors relied upon by the trial court is supported by evidence of a clear and convincing quality. In the final analysis, this was a factual situation. The facts were resolved in favor of Errol Joe, and we will not engage in factfinding or substitute our judgment on that issue.
The element of a confidential relationship is shown by the evidence. Under the trial court's construction of the facts, Robert and Norma entered into an agreement in which each relied on the survivor to see that the assets were properly distributed. Robert placed trust and confidence in Norma to see that Errol Joe received the proper distribution of assets, and it would be inequitable to permit her to disregard the terms of that agreement.
Finally, it is suggested that even if there was an agreement and a confidential relationship, Norma did not breach either. The argument is that under the terms of the agreement, Norma was to enjoy the income for her lifetime, and only upon her death was the principal to pass to Errol Joe. It then follows that there cannot be a breach of fiduciary duty or a betrayal of confidence unless and until Norma dies without the necessary provisions in her will.
*367 While this argument may have some logical basis, it ignores the realities of the situation. After Robert's death, some of the assets were placed in joint tenancy with Norma's daughter, Sherryl. This was obviously done with the intent that upon Norma's death, these assets would pass to Sherryl. In addition, Norma now denies that any agreement existed and testified, "I never made any commitment to Bob." These facts point to a breach of the agreement by Norma.
In summary, the findings of the trial court were supported by substantial competent evidence and the conclusions of law are consistent with and supported by the findings of fact.
EXHIBITS 6 AND 14 THROUGH 20
Norma and Sherryl next argue that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence plaintiff's exhibit 6 and plaintiff's exhibits 14 through 20. This argument is principally based upon the premise that an inadequate foundation was shown.
The trial court is possessed of discretion when ruling on admissibility of evidence. An attack on an evidentiary ruling requires that the party attacking that ruling show that the trial court abused its discretion. An abuse of discretion exists only when no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the trial court. St. Francis Regional Med. Center, Inc. v. Weiss, 254 Kan. 728, 748, 869 P.2d 606 (1994).
K.S.A. 60-407(f) provides that all relevant evidence is admissible unless otherwise provided by statute. Relevant evidence is evidence having "any tendency in reason to prove any material fact." K.S.A. 60-401(b). "It is axiomatic that a foundation must be laid establishing the competency, materiality and relevancy of all evidence prior to admission." Cansler v. Harrington, 231 Kan. 66, 69, 643 P.2d 110 (1982).
We conclude that the trial court did not err in admitting the exhibits in question. Exhibit 6 was a photocopy of the schedule "E" of Robert's estate tax return. This exhibit listed all of Robert's jointly held property. In addition to schedule "E," the exhibit contains a listing of separate assets held by Norma at Robert's death. The separate property was identified by Norma on direct *368 examination. We conclude this exhibit was clearly relevant and material and that a proper foundation was laid.
Exhibits 14 through 20 consisted of financial records which traced the assets from the time Robert and Norma were married until Robert's death. These exhibits were clearly relevant. One of the principal issues in this action was to identify which assets originated as Robert's separate property and which assets were accumulated during the marriage. Exhibits 14 through 20 were relevant on that issue.
Norma and Sherryl also argue about the authenticity of the records. They suggest that these exhibits were admitted without proper foundation, identification, or indicia of trustworthiness. The principal problem with this particular argument is that the parties stipulated as to the authenticity of the records prior to trial.
We see no need to describe with particularity the evidence purported to be shown by each exhibit. It seems to us that one of the principal issues in the admission of evidence of this sort is its authenticity. The parties stipulated as to the authenticity of those records, and we find no error on the part of the trial court in admitting exhibits 6 and 14 through 20.
JUDGMENT AGAINST SHERRYL HOLMES
Sherryl takes issue with the trial court's finding of fact No. 32. This finding identifies assets which were brought into the marriage by Robert and later transferred by Norma into joint tenancy between herself and Sherryl. Sherryl argues that this finding of fact is not supported by substantial competent evidence. We disagree and have previously indicated our decision that all of the trial court's findings of fact were supported by substantial competent evidence. Our earlier comments are also relevant concerning the position of Sherryl in arguing that the findings of fact were not supported by substantial competent evidence.
Sherryl also argues that no findings of fact remain which would support the judgment entered against her.
The trial court does not suggest that Sherryl was culpable in procuring the transfers to her mother and herself as joint tenants. *369 Culpability is not the issue. The stark fact is that Sherryl is a joint tenant on a substantial amount of assets on which the trial court has imposed a constructive trust. "If the trustee in breach of trust transfers trust property and no value is given for the transfer, the transferee does not hold the property free of the trust, although he had no notice of the trust." Kline v. Orebaugh, 214 Kan. 207, Syl. ¶ 6, 519 P.2d 691 (1974).
The fact that Sherryl did not procure the transfer of the property does not entitle her to hold it free of trust nor warrant a conclusion that the judgment against her is invalid. Norma testified that she wanted Sherryl to have access to the joint tenancy accounts in case they were needed to take care of Norma. In addition, Norma testified that she intended Sherryl to get the accounts upon her death.
We hold that the trial court did not err in entering judgment against Sherryl. The findings of fact made by the trial court support that judgment.

     MILLS, JUSTICE, FOR THE COURT:


                                     STATEMENT OF THE CASE

¶1. On November 5, 1996, Janet Dampeer and her daughter, Brittany Dampeer, by and through her
mother, filed their separate complaints in the Circuit Court of Smith County against the State of Mississippi
and Robert Ishee, alleging negligence on the part of Robert Ishee while in the scope of his employment with
the State of Mississippi. Upon request of the Appellants, the two complaints were consolidated by an
Order of the Smith County Circuit Court dated March 3, 1997. On November 8, 1996, the State of
Mississippi and Ishee filed a MRCP 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to comply with the notice and
statute of limitations provisions of the Mississippi Tort Claims Act as set out in Miss. Code Ann. § 11-46-
11 (Supp.1998). Such motion was denied by the trial court. Aggrieved by the trial court's denial of the
Motion to Dismiss, the State of Mississippi and Robert Ishee appeal to this Court through interlocutory
appeal.

                                      STATEMENT OF THE FACTS

¶2. On June 12, 1994, while Janet and Brittany Dampeer were parked in the Wal-Mart parking lot in
Magee, Mississippi, Robert Ishee backed a Boswell Retardation Center van into their automobile. The
Dampeers assert that, by reason of Ishee's negligence, both Janet and Brittany sustained serious physical
injuries and thereby did incur, and will continue to incur, substantial medical expenses. They note that Ishee
is an employee of the Boswell Retardation Center which is a facility owned by the State of Mississippi. In
their complaint they demand judgment of and from the Appellants in the amount of $25,000, plus costs of
Court.

¶3. In a letter dated June 15, 1994, the Dampeers' attorney notified the Boswell Retardation Center that he
represented Dampeer advising as follows:

      This is to advise you that we represent Mrs. Janet Dampeer and her minor daughter, Brittany
      Dampeer, for property damage and personal injuries sustained in a motor vehicle collision which
      occurred on June 12, 1994 in the parking lot of Magee Wal-Mart, when your vehicle, being driven
      by Robert H. Ishee, struck the rear of Mrs. Dampeer's 1990 Pontiac Grand Prix.

      I shall appreciate you, or your liability insurance carrier, contacting me within the next fifteen days
      concerning the contents of this letter.

¶4. Subsequently, in a letter dated June 21, 1994, and addressed to Ms. Dampeer, the Mississippi Tort
Claims Board wrote the following in regard to a notice of loss received from the Department of Mental
Health:

      We have received notice of loss from the above agency. Please provide an estimate of repair to this
      agency for consideration of your claim for damages.

      If you have already sent estimates to a state agency or to the Tort Claims Board, please disregard this
      notice.

¶5. On November 5, 1996, the Dampeers filed their separate complaints with the Smith County Circuit
Court. Subsequently, on November 8, 1996, the State of Mississippi and Robert Ishee filed their Motion to
Dismiss alleging that Dampeer violated the notice provisions and the statute of limitations provision of the
Mississippi Tort Claims Act. Such motion was denied on December 31, 1996. Following the denial of said
motion, the Appellants filed a Petition for Interlocutory Appeal on January 14, 1997. Such petition was
denied by the Circuit Court, but taken up on interlocutory appeal by this Court on February 6, 1998.

                                        STANDARD OF REVIEW

¶6. This Court conducts a "de novo review of questions of law." Weeks v. Thomas, 662 So.2d 581, 583
(Miss. 1995). A motion to dismiss under MRCP 12(b)(6) "tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint." This
Court has held that "to grant this motion there must appear to a certainty that the plaintiff is entitled to no
relief under any set of facts that could be proved in support of the claim." Busching v. Griffin, 465 So.2d
1037, 1039 (Miss.1985) (citations omitted). Further, this Court stated in Weeks v. Thomas that in order to
survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the complaint need only state a set of facts that will allow the plaintiff "some
relief in court." Weeks, 662 So.2d at 583.

                                                  ANALYSIS

      WHETHER THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY FAILING TO GRANT APPELLANT'S
      MOTION TO DISMISS WHERE THE COMPLAINT WAS FILED SEVENTEEN
      MONTHS AFTER THE TIME FOR FILING SUIT HAD LAPSED.

¶7. In their chief assignment of error, the State of Mississippi and Ishee assert that the Dampeers' suits are
barred by the one-year statute of limitations. This action is governed by the Mississippi Tort Claims Act.
The Act is set out in full in Miss. Code Ann. §§ 11-46-1, et seq. (Supp.1998). Section 11-46-11(3) reads
as follows:

      (3) All actions brought under the provisions of this chapter shall be commenced within one (1) year
      next after the date of the tortious, wrongful or otherwise actionable conduct on which the liability
      phase of the action is based, and not after; provided, however, that the filing of a notice of claim as
      required by subsection (1) of this section shall serve to toll the statute of limitations for a period of
      ninety-five (95) days. The limitations period provided herein shall control and shall be exclusive in all
      actions subject to and brought under the provisions of this chapter, notwithstanding the nature of the
      claim, the label or other characterization the claimant may use to describe it, or the provisions of any
      other statute of limitations which would otherwise govern the type of claim or legal theory if it were
      not subject to or brought under the provisions of this chapter.

Miss. Code Ann. § 11-46-11 (Supp.1998).(1)

¶8. The Appellants correctly argue that section (3) of the governing statute laid out above demands that the
complaint be filed within one year of the actionable conduct. The statute also provides that the limitation
period be tolled for ninety-five days after the required notice of claim is filed with the chief executive officer
of the governmental agency. Therefore, when the proper requirements of bringing a claim for injury against a
governmental agency in the State of Mississippi are met, including the giving of the proper notice, the statute
of limitations allows one year, plus ninety-five days in which to bring the claim.

¶9. In the instant case the accident occurred on June 12, 1994. The complaint was filed November 5,
1996, nearly two years and five months after the accident. This claim is barred by the applicable one-year
statute of limitation. See Mississippi Dep't of Public Safety v. Stringer, No. 97-IA-00187-SCT, 1999
WL 353025 (Miss. June 3, 1999) (applying one-year Tort Claims Act statute of limitations to bar suit);
Marcum v. Hancock County Sch. Dist., No. 97-CA-00916-SCT, 1999 WL 353073 (Miss. June 3,
1999).

¶10. We do not discuss whether the notice of claim substantially complied with the notice of claim provision
under our recent authorities set forth in Reaves v. Randall, 729 So. 2d 1237 (Miss. 1998), and Carr v.
Town of Shubuta, No. 96-CT-01266-SCT, 1999 WL 62772 (Miss. Feb. 11, 1999). The Dampeers
failed to timely file their complaints under any set of facts before us. The trial court erred in denying the
motion to dismiss. We therefore reverse the judgment of the lower court and render judgment for the State
of Mississippi and Robert Ishee and finally dismiss with prejudice the complaints filed herein.

¶11. REVERSED AND RENDERED.

No. 14395.

Dec. 7, 1954.

DENMAN, Chief Judge.


1
Attorney Gregory S. Stout moves for appellant an extension of time to January 9, 1955 to file an opening brief which he failed to file when due on November 20, 1954.  The ground of his application is that the attorney has accepted an assignment by a District Court of Appeal of the State of California, an inferior state court, to write a report pertaining to an analysis of a provision of the California Constitution.


2
It further appears that Mr. Stout's client is, during his appeal, in the custody of this court in the San Francisco County Jail and that during such custody he is not serving time on the sentence from which his appeal is pending.  That is to say, the wrong already done his client by not filing even now the brief due November 20, 1954, he seeks to extend by adding 30 days more to his client's imprisonment.


3
Whether such wrongful conduct by an officer of his court constitutes a contempt is not to be determined on this motion.  However, unless the appellant's brief is filed within ten days hereof, the question of Mr. Stout's conduct is certain to be raised.


4
Time to file appellant's opening brief is extended to December 17, 1954.

John J. Fish, for plaintiffs.
Dale H. Fillmore, Corporation Counsel, and B. Ward Smith, Frederick G. Weideman and James A. Broderick, Assistants Corporation Counsel, for defendant.
DETHMERS, J.
Defendant appeals from decree enjoining enforcement of a zoning ordinance against plaintiffs' property because unreasonable and confiscatory as applied thereto.
Each of plaintiffs owns 1 of 8 lots on the south side of Ford road in the city of Dearborn across from the lots in Dearborn township involved in Ritenour v. Township of Dearborn, 326 Mich 242. Seven of the lots have a width of 20 feet and one 24.44 feet, fronting on Ford road, with depths varying from 100 to 110 feet. Some of plaintiffs purchased their lots prior to, and some after, the adoption of the original ordinance which zoned the lots for residence C use and some bought after adoption of an amendment changing the zoning to the present residence A classification. Original building restrictions, since expired, limited use of some of the lots to business purposes and others to business or residential. *498 Lots across the road in the township have been zoned light commercial since our holding in Ritenour and many are so used. Lots on the south side of Ford road, immediately west of the lots here involved, are zoned business B and those to the east, running for a considerable distance, are vacant. The ordinance in question provides "there shall be a minimum of 10 feet between residences."
Plaintiffs prayed that the ordinance be decreed to be unconstitutional and void as applied to their lots, that they be decreed to be business property, that defendant be enjoined from enforcing the ordinance with respect thereto, and that a building permit for nonresidential purposes be required to issue as relates to 1 of the lots.
Defendant says the bill is multifarious. This it predicates in part on the fact that some plaintiffs acquired lots before, and some after, the ordinance and its subsequent amendment, suggesting that, on the authority of Hammond v. Bloomfield Hills Building Inspector, 331 Mich 551, the rights of those who purchased before the ordinance differ, for that reason, from those who bought thereafter. Hammond does not so hold. Provisions of a zoning ordinance void as relates to a lot because unreasonable and confiscatory are not made valid with respect thereto by the transfer of title from the owner to another. Faucher v. Grosse Ile Township Building Inspector, 321 Mich 193. CL 1948, § 608.1 (Stat Ann § 27.591), permits joining a number of plaintiffs if sufficient grounds appear for uniting the causes of action in order to promote the convenient administration of justice. That is the consideration warranting joinder here, particularly because defendant is not thereby prejudiced. Gilmer v. Miller, 319 Mich 136. The fact that 1 plaintiff seeks, in addition to injunctive relief, a provision in the decree requiring issuance to him of a building permit, which might be *499 accomplished by mandamus, does not render the bill multifarious inasmuch as equity, having acquired jurisdiction to restrain defendant as prayed, may retain it to grant complete relief and finally dispose of the controversy even though some of the questions propounded could have been raised and some of the relief sought could have been obtained in a law action. City of Ecorse v. Peoples Community Hospital Authority, 336 Mich 490.
Defendant contends that plaintiffs had an adequate remedy at law for testing the validity of the ordinance, namely, mandamus to compel issuing of building permits of a character prohibited by the ordinance. As relates to 7 of the plaintiffs, it does not appear that they were ready to build or desired such permits. From the pleadings it does appear that defendant was about to institute condemnation proceedings against the lots in question and others for park and green-belt purposes. Defendant may not, through the device of zoning for a use to which property is not suited, depress its value preliminary to condemning it for public purpose. Grand Trunk Western R. Co. v. City of Detroit, 326 Mich 387; Long v. City of Highland Park, 329 Mich 146. Under such circumstances, equity alone could afford plaintiffs the necessary remedy. Resort was had to equity for the purpose of having zoning ordinances declared invalid and their enforcement enjoined in Ritenour v. Township of Dearborn, supra; Elizabeth Lake Estates v. Township of Waterford, 317 Mich 359; Faucher v. Grosse Ile Township Building Inspector, supra; Long v. City of Highland Park, supra; Hitchman v. Township of Oakland, 329 Mich 331.
Is the ordinance unreasonable and confiscatory as applied to plaintiffs' lots? It limits use to residences which, under its provisions, cannot be constructed on these lots at a width of more than 10 feet, comparable, *500 in this respect, to the situation in Ritenour. Other requirements of the ordinance with respect to area, minimum width of side yards, et cetera, cannot be complied with so as to permit construction of usable residences. Defendant's answer admits, in effect, plaintiffs' charge, that the provisions of the ordinance make use of the lots for residential purposes physically impossible, by alleging, in response thereto, that plaintiffs could comply by combining 2 or more lots for the building of residences thereon. We think the decision in Ritenour controlling here. Distinctions between that case and this in the respect that there the plaintiff acquired the property prior to enactment of the ordinance, that the property there involved had once been zoned for business purposes, and that the action there was brought by plaintiff within a year after adoption of the ordinance while here it was not brought until 22 years later, do not serve to alter the fact that the provisions of the ordinance would render plaintiffs' property here almost worthless. That the city may not do. Long v. City of Highland Park, supra. Transfer of title, or the lapse of 22 years, after adoption of the ordinance does not relieve the ordinance of its unreasonable and confiscatory character. It is invalid as applied to plaintiffs' lots.
Finally, defendant urges that plaintiffs have no standing in a court of equity because they did not first apply to the appeal board created under the ordinance. This point was not raised below nor in the statement of reasons and grounds for appeal and, accordingly, is not entitled to consideration here. At all events, it is without merit. The appeal board could not determine the validity of the ordinance nor afford plaintiffs the necessary relief under the circumstances of this case when building permits were not desired but redress against measures likely to depress value prior to condemnation *501 proceedings was sought. Austin v. Older, 278 Mich 518.

Justice TURNER delivered the opinion of the court:
In May 2002, a jury convicted defendants, Michael Slover, Jr., Michael Slover, Sr., and Jeanette Slover, of the first degree murder of Karen Slover. Michael, Jr., and Michael, Sr., were also convicted of concealment of a homicidal death. All three defendants were sentenced to prison and filed a notice of appeal with this court. In September 2002, the State filed a motion to release defense exhibits for scientific testing. The trial court granted the motion and found no just reason for delaying the appeal.
On appeal, defendants argue the trial court had no jurisdiction to order testing of defense exhibits because those exhibits are part of the record on appeal. The State argues defendants' appeal must be dismissed because the trial court's order did not constitute a final order or judgment from which defendants could appeal. We affirm.

I. BACKGROUND
In May 2002, a jury convicted defendants Michael Slover, Jr., and his parents, Michael Slover, Sr., and Jeanette Slover, of the first degree murder of Michael, Jr.'s former wife, Karen Slover. Michael, Jr., and Michael, Sr., were also convicted of concealment of a homicidal death. In June 2002, the trial court sentenced all three defendants to 60 years' imprisonment. Michael, Jr., and Michael, Sr., also received five-year prison sentences for their convictions of concealment of a homicidal death. In July 2002, defendants filed motions to reduce their sentences, which the trial court denied. Thereafter, defendants filed a notice of appeal (No. 4-02-0587).
In September 2002, the State filed a motion, naming all three defendants, to *570 release defense exhibits for scientific testing. The motion indicated three defense exhibits admitted during defendants' trial contained some animal hairs unsuitable for identification, along with some possible cat hairs, that were taken by police from a 1992 Bonneville. Further, Mary Slover, the daughter of Michael, Sr., and Jeanette, and the sister of Michael, Jr., formerly lived at a house in Springfield that a forensic scientist identified to have cat and dog hairs following an investigatory examination. The State indicated a petition had been filed under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 (705 ILCS 405/1-1 through 7-1 (West 2000)) in Macon County case No. 00-JA-12, alleging the biological son of Michael, Jr., and the adopted son of Mary was a neglected and abused minor. The State had filed an expedited petition for termination of parental rights. The State indicated the doctor who performed canine deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing in the defendants' murder case was willing to perform feline DNA testing of the State's enumerated exhibits and the cat hair from Mary's former residence. The State submitted "the release of the three defense exhibits for feline DNA testing would advance the interests of justice in the pending juvenile case of [No.] 00-JA-12."
In September 2002, the trial court held a hearing on the State's motion. Defendants' counsel argued the trial court had no jurisdiction as their appeals had been filed. If the court did have jurisdiction, defendants argued, the State wanted to subject the cat hair to destructive testing, which would be prejudicial to defendants if the appellate court ordered further proceedings in the trial court. The trial court found it had jurisdiction to rule on the matter, stating it had authority to enter orders with regard to property in its custody. The court also found the State presented good cause for destructive testing of the evidence. As a condition of the testing, the court required a photograph taken to identify the exhibits.
Defense counsel requested the clerk be directed to file a notice of appeal. The trial court found its order was governed by the civil appeal rules pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 612 (177 Ill.2d R. 612). In its written order pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 304(a) (155 Ill.2d R. 304(a)), the court concluded there was no just reason for delaying the appeal. Per defense counsel's request, the trial court stayed its order until further order by the court. This appeal followed. In October 2002, Jeanette filed a motion to join in the interlocutory appeal. She later filed a notice of appeal in November 2002. In February 2003, this court allowed Jeanette's motion for leave to file a late notice of appeal.

II. ANALYSIS

A. Appellate Court Jurisdiction
Before we determine whether the trial court had jurisdiction to consider the State's motion, we must determine whether this court has jurisdiction to consider defendants' appeal. In their appellate brief, defendants contend this court has jurisdiction pursuant to Supreme Court Rules 603 and 606 pertaining to criminal appeals (134 Ill.2d R. 603; 188 Ill.2d R. 606). The State argues we must dismiss defendants' appeal. The trial court issued an order pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 304(a), finding no just reason for delaying appeal of its order granting the State's motion to release defense exhibits for scientific testing.
Supreme Court Rule 304(a) provides, in part, as follows:
"If multiple parties or multiple claims for relief are involved in an action, an appeal may be taken from a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than *571 all of the parties or claims only if the trial court has made an express written finding that there is no just reason for delaying either enforcement or appeal or both. * * * In the absence of such a finding, any judgment that adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties is not enforceable or appealable and is subject to revision at any time before the entry of a judgment adjudicating all the claims, rights, and liabilities of all the parties." 155 Ill.2d R. 304(a).
When the criminal appeal rules govern, Rule 304(a) does not apply. In re D.D., 337 Ill.App.3d 998, 1008, 272 Ill.Dec. 706, 788 N.E.2d 10, 17 (2002). However, an appellate court's jurisdiction to consider an appeal "does not derive solely from a party's invocation of the correct supreme court rule." In re O.H., 329 Ill.App.3d 254, 257, 263 Ill.Dec. 718, 768 N.E.2d 799, 801 (2002). Moreover, the trial court indicated the civil appeal rules applied after looking for guidance under Supreme Court Rule 612, setting forth the procedural matters that are governed by civil appeal rules. The court noted civil appeal rules applied to the removal of records from the reviewing court. Supreme Court Rule 372 (155 Ill.2d R. 372), a civil appeal rule applicable to criminal appeals, focuses on the removal of the record from the appellate court, not the removal of exhibits from the record on appeal for scientific testing. However, the similarity between the procedural matters of removing records from the reviewing court and allowing testing of an exhibit that is part of the record on appeal is enough to enable the case to fall within the civil appeal rules. Here, the order allowing destructive testing of the exhibits created a final judgment. As this amounted to a procedural matter, along with the trial court's written order pursuant to Rule 304(a), we conclude this case is properly before us.
B. Trial Court Jurisdiction
Generally, "[t]he filing of a notice of appeal transfers jurisdiction to the appellate court instanter and simultaneously divests the trial court of jurisdiction to enter additional orders of substance in a case." People v. Kolzow, 332 Ill.App.3d 457, 459, 265 Ill.Dec. 532, 772 N.E.2d 903, 904 (2002). The trial court may not then enter orders changing or modifying a judgment or its scope or interfering with the review of the judgment. Kolzow, 332 Ill. App.3d at 459, 265 Ill.Dec. 532, 772 N.E.2d at 905. The trial court does retain jurisdiction to determine matters that are collateral or incidental to the judgment being appealed. Brownlow v. Richards, 328 Ill. App.3d 833, 837, 263 Ill.Dec. 31, 767 N.E.2d 482, 485 (2002).
In this case, the trial court's order did not modify the judgment or interfere with the review of that judgment. Further, the court's order did not dispose of the issues defendants had invoked our jurisdiction to review in their murder appeal. Thus, defendants' criminal appeal did not automatically divest the trial court of jurisdiction in regard to the State's motion.
Defendants argue the trial court did not have jurisdiction to order the scientific testing of defense exhibits. We disagree. Defendants contend the physical evidence, such as the cat hair, is part of the record on appeal based on Supreme Court Rule 608 (177 Ill.2d R. 608), and thus the trial court could not make substantive rulings on that evidence.
Rule 608(a) provides, in part, as follows:
"The clerk of the circuit court shall prepare the record on appeal upon the filing of a notice of appeal and in all cases in which a death sentence is imposed. * * * The record on appeal must contain the following:

*572 * * *
(10) exhibits offered at trial and sentencing, along with objections, offers of proof, arguments, and rulings thereon; except that physical and demonstrative evidence, other than photographs, which do not fit on a standard size record page shall not be included in the record on appeal unless ordered by a court upon motion of a party or upon the court's own motion." 177 Ill.2d R. 608(a).
Supreme Court Rule 608 addresses the requirements the clerk of the circuit court must adhere to in preparing the record on appeal. However, it does not address whether the trial court has the authority to order the testing of exhibits used at trial while the case is presently on appeal. For that determination, we look toward our supreme court's general administrative order on recordkeeping in the trial courts. Pursuant to its general administrative authority, the supreme court has stated:
"PART I
RECORD OF THE CASE
The records of the case to be prepared and maintained by the clerk shall be as follows:
* * *
G. EXHIBITS

Unless otherwise ordered, * * * exhibits received in evidence shall be:
1. Retained by the clerk while the right of appeal exists. In criminal, traffic, ordinance, and conservation cases in which the defendant has been found guilty[,] exhibits shall also be retained until the defendant has paid the fine, served his sentence, or has been released from probation or parole.
2. Released by the Clerk:
a. When the time for appeal has passed, provided that, in criminal, traffic, ordinance[,] and conservation cases in which the defendant has been found guilty, exhibits shall not be released until the defendant has paid the fine, served his sentence[,] or has been released from probation or parole.
b. At any time by order of the judge who presided at the trial of the case, or by order of the chief judge." Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts, General Administrative Order on Recordkeeping in the Circuit Courts, adopted by the Supreme Court of Illinois on May 20, 1968, as amended, effective April 23, 2003, at iv, xii.
Based on the supreme court's pronouncement, we find a trial court has jurisdiction to determine whether exhibits used at trial should be submitted for scientific testing while the remainder of the case is on appeal.

C. Order Releasing Defense Exhibits
A trial court has the inherent power to maintain and control its records. In re Marriage of Johnson, 232 Ill.App.3d 1068, 1072, 174 Ill.Dec. 209, 598 N.E.2d 406, 409 (1992). With this in mind, the trial court must use its discretion in determining whether exhibits should be released by the clerk. See, e.g., Doe v. Carlson, 250 Ill.App.3d 570, 574, 189 Ill.Dec. 205, 619 N.E.2d 906, 909 (1993) (trial court has the discretion to impound judicial records after weighing the interests involved in accessing the record or keeping access restricted); Johnson, 232 Ill.App.3d at 1072-73, 174 Ill.Dec. 209, 598 N.E.2d at 409 (access to judicial records is left to sound discretion of trial court based on the relevant facts and circumstances of the case). When confronted with a motion to release exhibits for scientific testing, the trial court must balance the competing interests, *573 including, but not limited to, the possible prejudice to the defendant, the State's desire to advance the interests of justice, and the State's need for testing to accomplish its planned and stated objective.
In the case sub judice, the State established in its motion that Dr. Joy Halverson indicated she was capable of performing and willing to perform DNA testing on animal hairs from defense exhibits and cat hairs from Mary Slover's former residence. The State alleged the testing would advance the interests of justice in the pending juvenile case and the determination of whether the parental rights of Mary and Michael, Jr., should be terminated. Specifically, the State alleged the evidence could point to Mary's connection with the Karen Slover murder or its concealment. Defendants, on the other hand, argued at the hearing that destructive testing would be prejudicial in the event of a retrial. However, the State noted the evidence was not large enough for a jury to assess, unlike a "big coat" or "bloody knife." Also, the State indicated the conclusions made after scientific testing could benefit the defense.
In its decision, the trial court found "good cause" for the scientific testing. The court also required as a condition of the scientific testing that a photograph be taken of any exhibits of sufficient quality to identify them. We find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing scientific testing of the defense exhibits. The trial court was presented with the State's need for the evidence and the possible prejudicial impact such testing might have on defendants. The court weighed each position, made an additional requirement to keep a record of the evidence, and ruled accordingly. As the State presented evidence that scientific testing could further the interests of justice and defendants were unconvincing in their claim of prejudice, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the State's motion.

III. CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated, we affirm the trial court's judgment.
Affirmed.

ORDER
ROBERT H. HALL, District Judge.
James Messer, Jr., who is scheduled to be executed before July 9, 1986, petitions this court for a writ of Habeas Corpus, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254. This court has stayed petitioner's execution pending a full review of the issues raised by the petition. For the reasons set forth herein, the court DENIES prisoner's petition, and accordingly lifts the stay of execution.

FACTS
Petitioner, James E. Messer, Jr., was indicted by the grand jury of Polk County, Georgia, during the November Term, 1979, for kidnapping with bodily injury and for the murder of Rhonda Tanner. A special plea of insanity was filed on behalf of the petitioner. After two subsequent state sponsored psychiatric examinations established that petitioner was mentally competent to stand trial, the special plea of insanity was withdrawn. At his trial petitioner pleaded not quilty. Following a trial by jury on February 7, 1980, petitioner was found guilty on both charges and sentenced to death for both offenses. Petitioner received the death penalty for murder after the jury found the presence of two statutory aggravating circumstances, (1) that the murder was committed during the course of another capital felony, the kidnapping with bodily injury, and (2) that the murder was outrageously and wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture to the victim. The jury found one aggravating circumstance with respect to the kidnapping with bodily injury charge, that the crime was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved aggravated battery and torture to the victim. The death sentence was imposed *1037 on February 8, 1980. Petitioner's motion for a new trial was denied after hearing on May 20, 1980.
On direct appeal, the petitioner raised six issues, including denial of the motion for an independent psychiatric examination. The Supreme Court of Georgia considered these allegations and also conducted a sentence review, finding that the evidence supported the verdict, that the sentence was not imposed under passion or prejudice, that the evidence supported the aggravating circumstances, that the death penalty was not disproportionate and that the charge at the sentencing phase was proper. Thus, the court affirmed both the convictions and the sentences. Messer v. State, 247 Ga. 316, 276 S.E.2d 15 (1981). A motion for rehearing was denied on March 18, 1981.
Petitioner subsequently filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States challenging the denial of an independent psychiatric examination. This petition was denied on October 5, 1981. Messer v. Georgia, 454 U.S. 882, 102 S.Ct. 367, 70 L.Ed.2d 193 (1981).
Petitioner then filed a petition for habeas corpus relief in the Superior Court of Butts County, Georgia, on January 5, 1982. On or about January 25, 1982, the petitioner filed an amendment to the petition and a brief in support. Petitioner did not raise the denial of the motion for independent psychiatric examination. The state habeas corpus court denied relief without a hearing on February 23, 1982. Petitioner's Application for Certificate of Probable Cause to Appeal was denied on April 20, 1982. Subsequently, a petition for a writ of certiorari was filed in which the petitioner challenged the admission of his confession and asserted that he was arrested without probable cause. Certiorari was denied on October 4, 1982. Messer v. Zant, 459 U.S. 882, 103 S.Ct. 182, 74 L.Ed.2d 148, rehng. den., sub. nom, Cape v. Zant, 459 U.S. 1059, 103 S.Ct. 479, 74 L.Ed.2d 626 (1982).
Petitioner filed an application for habeas corpus relief in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Rome Division, on November 23, 1982. In that petition, the petitioner raised the denial by the trial court of the motion for an independent psychiatric examination and funds for an expert.
The case was transferred to the Atlanta Division and an evidentiary hearing was held before United States Magistrate Joel M. Feldman on August 5, 1983. On February 1, 1984, the magistrate entered a report and recommendation recommending that relief be denied as to the conviction, but suggesting that relief be granted as to the sentencing phase finding that counsel was ineffective during the closing argument at the sentencing phase. On March 30, 1984, this court entered an order adopting all portions of the magistrate's report and recommendation except that portion dealing with the effectiveness of counsel at the sentencing phase. This court concluded that petitioner had failed to show any prejudice resulting from this allegation. Messer v. Francis, No. C82-419A (N.D.Ga. March 30, 1984) (Hall, J.). This court also ruled on certain other allegations not addressed by the magistrate and denied a certificate for probable cause to appeal. Id. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals granted the certificate on June 1, 1984.
Subsequently, a panel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this court's decision denying habeas corpus relief in an opinion dated April 30, 1985. Messer v. Kemp, 760 F.2d 1080 (11th Cir. 1985). Only three issues were raised on appeal; the denial of the motion for a mistrial, the allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel and the question of whether jury instructions were correct on the kidnapping with bodily injury charge. A petition for rehearing en banc was denied on August 23, 1985. Petitioner then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States which was denied on January 21, 1986. Messer v. Kemp, ___ U.S. ___, 106 S.Ct. 864, 88 L.Ed.2d 902 (1986).
On June 17, 1986, an order was signed setting a new execution time frame beginning at noon on July 2, 1986, and ending at *1038 noon on July 9, 1986. Petitioner filed a petition for habeas corpus relief in the Superior Court of Butts County, Georgia on June 26, 1986, raising five allegations, including the allegation that he had been denied funds for an independent psychiatric examination and that the death penalty was applied in a discriminatory fashion. No evidence was proffered to the state habeas corpus court by the petitioner, nor did petitioner assert that any was available.
On June 27, 1986, respondent filed a motion to dismiss the petition. At 8:00 a.m. on that day, a hearing was held before the Honorable Hal Craig on the petition, request for a stay and motion to dismiss. At 3:10 p.m. on that date, an order was filed denying the stay, dismissing the petition as successive as to four counts and finding the remaining count to be without merit. Petitioner filed a notice of appeal and an application for certificate of probable cause to appeal that afternoon. On Monday morning, June 30, 1986, petitioner filed an amendment to his application for a certificate of probable cause. Respondent filed a response to the application. On that same date, the Supreme Court of Georgia denied the application for a certificate of probable cause to appeal. Petitioner then filed the current petition with this court on July 1, 1986. This court orally granted petitioner's motion to proceed in forma pauperis.

DISCUSSION
Petitioner contends that he was convicted and sentenced to death in violation of the Georgia Constitution and the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Petitioner argues that under Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68, 105 S.Ct. 1087, 84 L.Ed.2d 53 (1985) he was denied funds to have an independent psychiatrist to aid in his defense, in violation of his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. (Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus custody ("Petition")). Petitioner also argues that the imposition of the death penalty violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment because it will be applied in a racially discriminatory manner. As an initial matter, the court finds that petitioner's claim that imposition of the death penalty violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment because it will be applied in a racially discriminatory manner, is without merit and cannot provide a basis for the relief sought. McCleskey v. Kemp, 753 F.2d 877 (11th Cir.1985) (en banc).[1]
Respondent pleads abuse of the writ under Rule 9(b) of the Rules Governing § 2254 cases. Specifically, respondent asserts that all claims raised in the instant petition have been raised in a prior federal habeas corpus petition. (Respondent's Answer/Response, "Response").[2] Therefore, to determine whether any ground for relief is properly before this court, the court must consider whether petitioner has abused the writ in bringing a successive petition.
This court holds that petitioner abused the writ in raising his Ake (denial of independent psychiatric evaluation) claim in his second habeas petition. Rule 9(b) of the Rules Governing 28 U.S.C. § 2254 provides:
A second or successive petition may be dismissed if the judge finds that it fails to allege new or different grounds for relief and if the prior determination was on the merits, or if new and different grounds are alleged, the judge finds that the failure of the petitioner to assert those grounds in a prior petition constitutes an abuse of the writ. *1039 28 U.S.C. § 2254 (1977). However, a petitioner may rebut the state's contention that he abused the writ in a successive petition in one of two ways:
"(a) If the ground was previously addressed in a federal habeas corpus proceeding, the petitioner must demonstrate that the decision was not on the merits, or the ends of justice would be served by reconsideration on the merits ...
(b) If the ground was not previously presented in a federal habeas corpus proceeding, the petitioner must demonstrate the failure to present the ground in the prior proceeding was neither the result of an intentional abandonment or withholding nor the product of inexcusable neglect." Witt v. Wainwright, 755 F.2d 1396, 1397 (11th Cir.1985), rev'd on other grounds 469 U.S. 412, 105 S.Ct. 844, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (1985) (emphasis supplied) see also, Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963).
In the instant case, it is not disputed that petitioner properly raised the claim of the unconstitutional denial of an independent psychiatric evaluation in his first habeas petition.[3]
Because this court finds that petitioner's denial of independent psychiatric evaluation claim constitutes a successive petition that has been decided on the merits in the previous habeas corpus proceeding, the court now turns to whether the "ends of justice" would be served by a reconsideration of this claim. Petitioner contends that reconsideration is required by an intervening change in the law applicable to the constitutionality of denying petitioner's request for an independent psychiatric evaluation for the purpose of preparing a defense of insanity. This court cannot agree.
Respondent urges that the Supreme Court's recent decision in Kuhlmann v. Wilson, ___ U.S. ___, 106 S.Ct. 2616, 2626, 91 L.Ed.2d 364 (1986) addressing the "ends of justice" standard, controls the instant case.[4]Kuhlmann involved a Sixth *1040 Amendment claim of denial of right to counsel based on court's denial of motion to suppress statements made to a jailhouse informant. The prisoner, in a successive petition for a writ, claimed that the change in the law occasioned by the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Henry, 447 U.S. 264, 100 S.Ct. 2183, 65 L.Ed.2d 115 (1980) mandated reconsideration of the Sixth Amendment claim. An opinion written by Justice Powell and joined in pertinent part by Chief Justice Burger, Justices Rehnquist and O'Connor, stated that:
In light of the historic purpose of habeas corpus and the interest implicated by successive petitions for federal habeas relief from a state conviction, we conclude that "the ends of justice" require federal courts to entertain such petitions only where the prisoner supplements his constitutional claim with a colorable showing of factual innocence.
Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 106 S.Ct. at 2626. The plurality stated that its purpose in requiring a "colorable showing of factual innocence" was to provide a specific guideline for district courts to use in resolving the "ends of justice" issue.
For several reasons, this court finds that Kuhlmann is not controlling precedent with respect to the "ends of justice" determination. First, the precedential value of a four justice opinion is highly suspect.[5] Simply stated, a position that does not garner the votes of at least five justices cannot be binding precedent where there is a contrary body of Supreme Court decisions. In Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 97 S.Ct. 990, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977), the Supreme Court restated the familiar notion that a four justice plurality opinion has no binding effect.[6]
Second, this court's belief that a majority of the court rejected the notion that the "colorable showing of factual innocence" is the only element to consider in deciding the "ends of justice" issue is supported by Justice Stevens' dissent. Justice Stevens explicitly rejected Justice Powell's "single factor" approach, contending that whether the petitioner has advanced a colorable claim of innocence is but "one of the facts that may be properly considered." Id. (Stevens, J. dissenting). Justices Stevens, Brennan and Marshall explicitly endorsed the court's traditional approach under Sanders, supra that the decision whether to hear a successive petition was committed "to the sound discretion of federal trial judges." Sanders, 373 U.S. at 18, 83 S.Ct. at 1079. Thus, based on a mere plurality of four votes, Kuhlmann does not change the basic approach of Sanders.[7]
*1041 Petitioner urged at oral argument that the recently decided case of Fleming v. Kemp, 794 F.2d 1478 (11th Cir.1986) should control the outcome of the case. In Fleming the Eleventh Circuit, without deciding the merits of that prisoner's habeas petition, stayed the scheduled execution pending further order of that court. Id. In deciding that the prisoner did not abuse the writ in raising an identical claim on a successive habeas petition, the circuit court reached the question of whether the "ends of justice" would be served by a second review of the claim. Id. The court reiterated that the "ends of justice" are defined by objective factors, such as whether there was a full and fair hearing on the original petition, or whether there was an intervening chanqe in the facts of the case or the applicable law. Id. There, the alleged intervening change in the applicable law was the Supreme Court's decision in Batson v. Kentucky, ___ U.S. ___, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986) (juror exclusion based on race held unconstitutional).
The Fleming court, however, did not discuss the Supreme Court's ruling in Kuhlmann, which was handed down the day before. Because the circuit did not consider and discuss the Kuhlmann case, this court feels Fleming's precedential value is questionable with respect to the "ends of justice" determination.
Additionally, Fleming contains no discussion of the many other objective factors courts consider when making the "ends of justice" determination. In Fleming, the fact that there was an intervening change in the applicable law alone was held to be enough to grant reconsideration of the petition. The Fleming court failed to discuss any other factor. In essence, that court proposed its own "single factor" approach, and ignored the Sanders line of cases which leave it to the sound discretion of the district courts to weigh these factors. No opinion in Kuhlmann supports the position that an intervening change in the applicable law standing alone requires reconsideration of a successive petition.
Although this court finds the Kuhlmann decision does not control the outcome of this case, this court cannot ignore the fact that four justices supported an opinion that would make a "colorable showing of factual innocence" the sole factor to consider when deciding the "ends of justice" question. Thus, to the extent the Fleming court did not explicitly consider whether the petitioner there had made a "colorable showing of factual innocence in making its "ends of justice" determination, this court feels Fleming is not controlling.
This court finds that neither Kuhlmann nor Fleming essentially alter the traditional approach to the "ends of justice" test set forth in Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963). The burden lies with the petitioner to demonstrate that a reconsideration would serve the ends of justice. Sanders, 373 U.S. at 15-19, 83 S.Ct. at 1077-79; Bass v. Wainwright, 675 F.2d 1204 (11th Cir.1982). In Sanders the court held:
If factual issues are involved, the applicant is entitled to a new hearing upon showing that the evidentiary hearing on the prior application was not full and fair ... If purely legal questions are involved, the applicant may be entitled to a new hearing upon showing an intervening change in the law or some other justification for having failed to raise a crucial point or argument in the prior *1042 application. Id. at 16-17, 83 S.Ct. at 1078.
The court went on to qualify its remarks in the following ways:

First, the foregoing enumeration is not intended to be exhaustive; the test is "the ends of justice" and it cannot be too finely particularized. Second, the burden is on the applicant to show that, although the ground of the new application was determined against him on the merits on a prior application, the ends of justice would be served by a redetermination of the ground. Id. at 17, 83 S.Ct. at 1078.
The Eleventh Circuit has elucidated the Sanders holding stating that "the `ends of justice' are defined by objective factors, such as whether there was a full and fair hearing on the original petition or whether there was an intervening change of the facts of the case or the applicable law." Witt v. Wainwright, 755 F.2d 1396, 1397 (11th Cir.1985). Briefly stated then, the law of Sanders leaves the decision to grant reconsideration of a successive petition to the sound discretion of the district court which may properly consider several objective factors in reaching this decision. Courts have considered the following factors proper in making the "ends of justice" determination.
First, the plurality opinion in Kuhlmann indicates that four justices were willing to adopt the "colorable showing of factual innocence" test as the sole factor in making the "ends of justice" inquiry. Indeed, Justice Stevens' dissent acknowledges this test as "one of the facts that may properly be considered," although he did not feel it was an essential element to the reconsideration of a successive petition. Kuhlmann (Stevens, J. dissenting). Justice Stevens went on to conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion because Kuhlmann was "one of those close cases in which the district court could have properly decided that a second review of the same contention was not required despite the intervening decision...." Id. Thus, at a minimum, five justices agree that whether petitioner has made a colorable showing of factual innocence is properly a factor to consider in making the "ends of justice" determination.
In the instant case, petitioner has made no such showing. Petitioner's counsel declined this court's invitation to make such a showing, arguing alternatively that the mere allegation that petitioner was insane established a "colorable showing", or that petitioner's claim regarding the "ends of justice" issue was established by other factors under Sanders such as an intervening change in the applicable law. (Transcript of oral argument on petition for habeas corpus p. 8-12, "Transcript"). When asked by this court whether petitioner had any claim of factual innocence, petitioner's counsel responded "there is a claim of innocence here. It's not a claim of factual innocence, it's a claim of legal innocence by reason of insanity." (Transcript at 10) Thus, by his own words counsel disavowed any showing that could establish the existence of this factor. Where, as here, both this court and the Eleventh Circuit in reviewing petitioner's first petition explicitly stated that the evidence of petitioner's guilt was "overwhelming", without making any showing of factual innocence whatsoever, petitioner has not made out a "colorable showing.[8]Messer v. Francis, No. C82-419R at 3 (N.D.Ga. March 30, 1984) (Hall, J. unpublished opinion) aff'd sub nom, Messer v. Kemp, 760 F.2d 1080, 1084 (11th Cir.1985).
Petitioner contends that other countervailing objective factors demonstrate that the "ends of justice" would be served by granting reconsideration. Namely, petitioner contends that the intervening change in law announced in Ake supra requires such a result. This court disagrees. Even assuming arguendo (1) that Ake did change the law relevant to the constitutionality *1043 of denying this petitioner an independent psychiatric evaluation for the preparation of his defense, and (2) that Ake applies retroactively to this petitioner on collateral review, this court feels an intervening change in law alone is insufficient to warrant reconsideration. In light of the plurality opinion in Kuhlmann that indicates the importance of the "colorable showing of factual innocence" factor, and three dissents in that case that emphasize the multiplicity of factors that may properly be considered, this court feels it would be inappropriate to give the change in intervening law alone controlling weight.[9]
The petitioner's failure to appeal an adverse ruling on his prior habeas petition is a factor to be considered in the "ends of justice" calculus of the Sanders test. Johnson v. Wainwright, 702 F.2d 909 (11th Cir.1983); Bass v. Wainwright, 675 F.2d 1204 (11th Cir.1982). Here, this court ruled on the merits of Messer's first petition on March 30, 1984. The court explicitly considered and denied relief on the denial of an independent psychiatric evaluation along with seven other grounds. Messer v. Francis, supra at 15. The Ake decision, the intervening change in law argued by petitioner as grounds for reconsideration of this opinion, was decided February 26, 1985. Ake supra. Petitioner on appeal from this court's denial of relief on his first petition did not raise Ake as a ground of appeal. This court has already ruled that this omission does not amount to "abandonment" of the claim, but as a factor to be considered under the ends of justice calculus it does weigh against petitioner. See discussion supra.
There are other factors that may be properly considered by this court, which are relevant to whether the ends of justice would be served by allowing reconsideration of a prisoner's second petition. The fact that a man's life is at stake is a weighty factor that this court fully appreciates. Potts v. Zant, 638 F.2d 727, 752 (11th Cir.1981). Also relevant is possible prejudice to the state e.g., here whether the state has access to witnesses that would be necessary to rebut petitioner's claim of insanity at the time of the offense. Id. Finality, here serves the state's legitimate punitive interests. When a prisoner is freed on a successive petition, often many years after the crime, the state may be unable successfully to retry him. Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U.S. 54, 62, 88 S.Ct. 1549, 1553, 20 L.Ed.2d 426 (1968) see Pate v. Robinson, 383 U.S. 375, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815 (1966). The state has offered no showing to support such a conclusion on this case. However, the litany of direct appeals and collateral attack in this case, demonstrates the point. See facts supra.
After weighing all the above-mentioned factors and carefully examining the record in this case, the court feels the "ends of justice" would not be served by reaching the merits of the successive petition. First, petitioner has chosen to make no showing of factual innocence. Thus, petitioner fails to satisfy this factor. It is the concern of at least five members of the Supreme Court that a "colorable showing of factual innocence" be one of the factors properly considered by a district court in ruling on reconsideration of a successive petition. Although this court assumes arguendo that Ake supra is an intervening change in the law applicable to the facts of petitioner's case, and that it applies retroactively to this petitioner, standing alone such is insufficient to require reconsideration. Where (1) petitioner has made no showing of factual innocence, (2) the evidence of petitioner's guilt was found to be "overwhelming" by both this court and the circuit court, and (3) petitioner had the opportunity, yet failed to raise the Ake ground of relief on appeal from this court's *1044 order denying petitioner's first petition, the court feels the "ends of justice" do not require reconsideration.

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the court considers this petition for a writ of habeas corpus to be a successive petition, and because this court feels the "ends of justice" would not be served by reconsideration, this court accordingly DENIES petitioner a writ of habeas corpus. The stay of execution ordered by this court is hereby lifted effective at noon July 8, 1986.
NOTES
[1]  The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari in McCleskey v. Kemp, No. ___ U.S. ___, 106 S.Ct. 3331, 92 L.Ed.2d 737 (1986), to consider whether the death penalty is being applied in a racially discriminatory manner. This court feels the grant of certiorari should not alter the court's denial of the petition in the case at bar.
[2]  In its Response, respondent pleads exhaustion contending that all the qrounds raised in the instant petition have not been previously raised in state proceedings. (Response at 2) However, respondent does not pursue this contention in its brief and the court does not feel compelled to discuss its merits.
[3]  Respondent raised at oral argument a conceptually distinct problem arising from the posture of this case. As the court holds, petitioner properly stated his denial of independent psychiatric evaluation as a ground for relief in his first habeas petition. However, he did not renew this argument on appeal. Respondent argues petitioner, thus, intentionally abandoned his claim.

The "intentional abandonment or withholding" doctrine applies on a second habeas only where petitioner has not "previously presented [the ground for relief] in a federal habeas corpus proceeding." Witt; supra; Cf. Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963).
Here, petitioner did present this ground in the first habeas petition, and this court considered and rejected his arguments. Messer v. Francis, No. C82-419R (March 30, 1984) (Hall, J.) (unpublished opinion). aff'd Messer v. Kemp, 760 F.2d 1080 (11th Cir.1985) reh denied, ___ U.S. ___, 106 S.Ct. 864, 88 L.Ed.2d 902 (1986).
Once this ground was raised in the first habeas petition, as required under Witt and Sanders supra, no abandonment for abuse of writ purposes could occur. Fleming v. Kemp, 794 F.2d 1478 (11th Cir.1986). Additionally, there is no evidence that the failure of petitioner to brief the issue on appeal was to "vex, harass, or delay" Sanders supra 373 U.S. at 18, 83 S.Ct. at 1078. Therefore, any contention that petitioner abused the writ by this "abandonment" is groundless.
[4]  Kuhlmann involved a situation in which defendant, after arraignment on charges of a 1970 robbery and murder, was confined in a cell with another prisoner who had previously agreed to act as a police informant. The defendant made incriminating statements, and the informant reported them to the police. Prior to trial, defendant moved to suppress the statements on the ground that they were obtained in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The trial court denied the motion finding that the informant had obeyed a police officer's instructions not to question defendant about the crimes and that defendant's statements were "spontaneous" and "unsolicited". In 1972, defendant was convicted for common law murder and felonious possession of a weapon. The State Appellate Court affirmed. In 1973, defendant sought federal habeas corpus relief, asserting a Sixth Amendment violation based on the same grounds. The district court denied the writ, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. After the 1980 decision in United States v. Henry, 447 U.S. 264 100 S.Ct. 2183, 65 L.Ed.2d 115 (1980), which applied the "deliberately elicited" test of Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964) to suppress statements made to a paid jailhouse informant, defendant unsuccessfully sought to have his conviction vacated by the state courts. In 1982, defendant filed a habeas corpus petition in district court, again raising the Sixth Amendment claim. The district court denied relief, but the court of appeals reversed.
[5]  Powell, J. announced the judgment of the court. Burger CJ., Rehinquist and O'Connor, JJ., joined Powell's discussion of the "ends of justice" test. Brennan, J. dissented joined by Marshall, J. Stevens, J. dissented separately. White and Blackmun, JJ., did not join Powell's "ends of justice" discussion.
[6]  The most commonly recognized theory on dealing with four vote pluralities is the statement in Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976) that "when a fragmented court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five justices, `the holding of the court may be viewed as that position taken by those members who concurred in the judgment on the narrowest grounds.'" See Note, The Precedential Value of Supreme Court Plurality Decisions, 80 Columbia L.Rev. 756 (1980) for a fuller discussion of the "narrowest grounds" approach.
[7]  If it is truly apparent that a "single factor" test is needed for the policy reasons set forth in Justice Powell's Kuhlmann opinion, this court feels the better analysis would be to extend the test of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), used in evaluating effectiveness of counsel issues on original habeas petitions, to the "ends of justice" question on successive petitions. This test would contemplate allowing reconsideration where there is a "reasonable probability that, but for [the denial of an independent psychiatric evaluation in preparation of an insanity defense that would have been a significant factor a trial], the result of the proceeding would have been different." Id. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. Restated simply, if the denial of the independent psychiatric evaluation in preparation for trial could reasonably have resulted in a different outcome, then reconsideration should be granted. This test has also been used as the test for materiality of exculpatory information not disclosed to the defense by the prosecution, United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 104, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 2397, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976), and in the test for materiality of testimony made unavailable to the defense by government deportation of a witness, United States v. Vallenzuela-Bernal, 458 U.S. 858, 102 S.Ct. 3440, 73 L.Ed.2d 1193 (1982).

This test would achieve the goals desired by Justice Powell and the three justices that joined his Kuhlmann opinion by (1) providing a clear rule for the district courts to apply, and (2) denying reconsideration to prisoners who have no chance of prevailing at retrial because "guilt is conceded or plain" Kuhlmann, 106 S.Ct. at 2626. The proposed test would also avoid problems where the "colorable showing of factual innocence" test does not logically apply. One example of these problems arises where a prisoner alleges constitutional error in the sentencing phase of a capital case. Guilt or innocence seems to be irrelevant in that context. See Kuhlmann, 106 S.Ct. p. 2622, n. 7 (Brennan, J. dissenting).
[8]  In Kuhlmann, the plurality noted the circuit below stated that the evidence of prisoner's guilt in that case "was nearly overwhelming." Kuhlmann, 106 S.Ct. at 2628. Here, the Eleventh Circuit stated, "[i]f ever there was an open and shut case, this is it ..."
[9]  Before Kuhlmann, a change in applicable law seemed to guarantee reconsideration in the Eleventh Circuit. This court is aware of no published case regarding successive petitioners in which the Eleventh Circuit has ever denied reconsideration where there was an intervening change in law which applied retroactively to a prisoner. Cf Young v. Kemp, 758 F.2d 514 (11th Cir.1985); Smith v. Kemp, 715 F.2d 1459 (11th Cir.1983); Fleming supra (granting reconsideration where intervening change applicable law occurred.)

Before FRIENDLY, Chief Circuit Judge, MISHLER, Chief District Judge, and WEINSTEIN, District Judge.
FRIENDLY, Chief Circuit Judge:
In this action against the United States, the Interstate Commerce Commission, Bush Terminal Railroad and certain of the latter's officers and directors, the City of New York, joined by several intervenors, asks us to annul an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission dated December 13, 1971, in F.D. No. 25896, which authorized abandonment of the entire line of Bush Terminal Railroad Company (the Railroad) in Kings County, New York, and Hudson County, New Jersey. The order, which was effective immediately, was entered after the Railroad on December 1, 1971, had unilaterally imposed an embargo on all outgoing freight and announced that on December 15, 1971, it would impose a similar embargo on all incoming freight, because of the allegedly unseaworthy condition of its marine equipment, and after users of the Railroad had begun an action to enjoin the embargo which they considered to be an unauthorized abandonment. The Railroad terminated operation on December 13 immediately on learning of the Commission's order.[1]
On December 17, the City began this action and sought a temporary restraining order, see 28 U.S.C. § 2284(3). Judge Weinstein denied this but set the City's motion for a temporary injunction for argument on December 22 before a three-judge court which he asked to have convened, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2321, 2325. At the argument, the Bush Terminal Users Association, Inc., United Transportation Union, the Brotherhood of Railway, Airline and Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express and Station Employes, and the Department of Transportation of the State of New York were allowed to intervene as plaintiffs. Issuance of *153 a temporary restraining order was again refused, but we reserved decision on the motion for a temporary injunction pending the filing of the record and briefs.
The Railroad, organized in 1903, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bush Universal, Inc., which had been known as Bush Terminal Company until July, 1968. The purpose of establishing the Railroad was to acquire franchise rights in city streets and extend to new buildings railroad services then being provided in Brooklyn, New York, by Bush Terminal. The line owned by the Railroad is only 1.8 miles long. This connects with some 13.56 miles of track in Brooklyn and car-float and towage facilities that are operated by the Railroad but are owned and had previously been operated by Bush Terminal, allegedly as agent for the Railroad and for trunk line carriers serving New York Harbor. In Bush Terminal R.R. Co. Operation, 257 I.C.C. 375 (1944), the Commission authorized the Railroad, pursuant to § 1(18) of the Interstate Commerce Act, to extend its railroad by acquiring through lease the trackage and other facilities owned by Bush Terminal. The lease took effect on January 1, 1945. Since then the Railroad, as a common carrier, has moved cars between industries in and near the Bush Terminal in Brooklyn across New York Harbor to and from various trunk line terminals in New Jersey. In December, 1968, Bush Terminal, having changed its name and become a conglomerate, controlled by Universal Consolidated Industries, Inc., a still more conglomerated conglomerate, conveyed all its real estate, including some of the land over which the Railroad operates, to a newly organized, wholly owned subsidiary, Bush Terminal Company, Inc. This new subsidiary assumed its parent's obligations under the lease to the Railroad. We will generally refer to Bush Universal, Inc. and Bush Terminal Company, Inc., simply as "the Terminal Company."
The Railroad, on October 23, 1969, filed an application under § 1(18) of the Interstate Commerce Act for permission to abandon the operation both of its owned and of its leased properties. Hearings were held in late June, 1970. The application was opposed by users of the service, governmental and quasi-governmental bodies and labor organizations representing the Railroad's employees. In their post-hearing briefs the City, the State, and the Users Association for the first time raised the issue that authorization of abandonment by the lessee, the Railroad, would not relieve the lessor, the Terminal Company, of its independent obligation to operate the leased properties, an obligation that would revive upon discontinuance of operations by the lessee. See Lehigh Valley R.R. Co. Proposed Abandonment of Operation, 202 I.C.C. 659, 663 (1935); Norfolk S.R.R. Co. Receivers Abandonment, 221 I.C.C. 258, 260 (1937); Livestock Terminal Service Co. Abandonment of Operation, 257 I.C.C. 1, 7 (1944); Hoboken R.R., Whse. & S.S. Connecting Co. Operation, 257 I.C.C. 739, 743-44 (1944). The Railroad responded, correctly enough as a matter of law, see Meyers v. Famous Realty, Inc., 271 F.2d 811, 814-815 (2 Cir. 1959), cert. denied, 362 U.S. 910, 80 S.Ct. 681, 4 L.Ed.2d 619 (1960), that this doctrine applies only when the lessor was a "carrier by railroad," see 49 U.S.C. § 1(18), when the lease was made; it claimed that the Terminal Company was not.
On June 3, 1971, the examiner rendered a report recommending authorization of the abandonment. He found that, despite various promotional efforts, the Railroad's traffic had seriously declined, due to motor vehicle competition, and the moving of industries away from the Brooklyn area served by it; that the Railroad "has sustained substantial losses for many years, and prospects for reversing the decline in traffic and for profitable operations are very slim;" and that the property owned and leased by the Railroad was in such poor condition that an expenditure by it of approximately $930,000 would be required for *154 rehabilitation of roadway and marine equipment.[2] With the Railroad's long record of losses and negative net worth, these funds could not be obtained except from the parent. The examiner concluded that, despite undoubted hardship to users, which might require many to move, with consequent loss of employment opportunities and revenues to the City and the State, there was no alternative to authorizing abandonment by the Railroad. Turning to the legal argument concerning the obligations of Terminal Company as lessor, the examiner concluded that this raised a factual issue of the lessor's earlier common carrier status, which had never previously been resolved and which could be tested in an action by the objecting parties under § 1(18) and (20). Thus, he declined to condition abandonment by the Railroad upon resumption of operation of the leased properties by the Terminal Company. Following the Commission's general practice in cases of complete abandonment where neither the carrier nor a parent carrier realizes economic advantages other than the termination of losses,[3] see Chicago, A. & S.R.R. Co. Receiver Abandonment, 261 I.C.C. 646, 652 (1946); Okmulgee Northern Ry. Co. Abandonment, 320 I.C.C. 637, 645-646 (1964); Manifestee & Repton R.R. Co. Abandonment, 324 I.C.C. 489, 492 (1964); Tennessee Central Ry. Co. Abandonment of Operations, 333 I.C.C. 443, 453-454 (1968), he declined to impose employee protective conditions.
Exceptions and a reply thereto by the Railroad were filed with the Commission in early August. The City's, the Unions' and the Users Association's exceptions requested oral argument. On November 3, the Users Association filed a petition for leave to file a petition to reopen the hearing to include further testimony concerning the willingness of users to pay a surcharge of $25 per car. *155 The Railroad replied by letter. On December 13, the Commission, acting by Division 3, entered the order to which we have referred. This noted that the exceptions had raised "a substantial question of possible damage to the environment" as a result of the substitution of trucks for railroad cars but concluded that "any damage that may occur to environmental amenities by our approval of this application is to be outweighed by the proven economic harm that would result from its denial." It upheld the findings and conclusions of the examiner and decided that, save for the point just stated, the exceptions and reply thereto raised no new or material issue and were not of such a nature as to require the issuance of a report. After denying the petition of the Users Association for leave to file a petition to reopen the record, it adopted the hearing examiner's order of abandonment "as the order of the Commission, Division 3, effective on the date of service hereof," which was specified to be December 13.

I.
If we were to view the matter apart from certain special considerations urged by the plaintiff and intervenors, it would be clear that the order of abandonment was supported by substantial evidence at the time it was issued. Between 1959 and 1969, the Railroad's traffic declined from 618,053 to 459,685 tons. During the same period, traffic for four types of customers  tenants of the Terminal Company; tenants of an unrelated organization, Bush Terminal Associates; customers located on private sidings; and the Brooklyn Army base  fell from 13,490 to 4,165 cars, those from the Army base having later dwindled to zero. Losses have been incurred every year since 1959. These attained highs of $368,431 and $376,644 in 1966 and 1967; while the losses for 1968 and 1969 were less, $311,910 and $220,582, respectively, the Railroad persuasively claimed the reduction was due principally to the deferral of maintenance expenditures which would have to be made if it were required to continue operations. The balance sheet as of December 31, 1969, shows current assets of $451,242 and current liabilities of $1,990,754.[4] The story seems to be the familiar one of decreased usage and higher costs leading to deterioration of plant, and deterioration of plant then leading to further decrease in usage and still further deterioration, until a time finally comes when the operation grinds to a halt, with attendant hardship on the remaining users and the employees. Courts are not free to annul the Commission's decision to allow abandonment under such circumstances simply because greater wisdom at an earlier date on the part of all concerned might have preserved a valuable transportation enterprise. See Washington & Old Dominion Users Ass'n v. United States, 287 F.Supp. 528 (E.D.Va. 1968) (three-judge court); Asbury v. United States, 298 F.Supp. 589 (W.D.Va. 1969) (three-judge court). As the examiner said, "an unprofitable operation cannot be expected to continue indefinitely for the benefit of shippers who may be adversely affected but who do not furnish sufficient traffic to support a line, or to furnish transportation during periods when trucks experience difficulty operating, or for such commodities as may not be handled economically by trucks."
Before the hearing examiner, the plaintiffs argued that the loss figures constituted only bookkeeping losses which must be disregarded because they reflect intercompany charges arising out of a leasing arrangement between a parent and a wholly owned subsidiary, and that the Railroad and its parent must be viewed as a single entity to obtain an accurate financial picture. The examiner had abundant basis for rejecting these arguments. The Commission had earlier found the leasing arrangement between the Terminal Company and the Railroad to be fair, 257 I.C.C. at 379-381, and the *156 examiner received and adopted new testimony reinforcing this conclusion. Apart from an annual fee of $25,000 for services such as telephones, casual engineering, and payroll accounting, which has remained unchanged since 1945 and which the Examiner permissibly found to be fair, indeed, low, payments were made for services actually rendered  such as maintenance work and managerial services of officers of the Railroad who are also officers of the Terminal Company  and for rent calculated on the basis of a basic rental component and a percentage rental component as provided in the lease. The percentage rental is 75% of the Railroad's net earnings from both its leased and owned properties; the basic rental is essentially an amount equivalent to property taxes, depreciation, and 5½% of the assessed value of the leased real estate and the agreed value of the other leased property. An owner would have incurred the various service and managerial expenses. No payment of percentage rental has been made since 1959, there having been no net earnings since that date. Finally, the basic rental provides less than a fair rate of return, at least under current conditions where prime corporate bonds command rates in the neighborhood of 7%. In fact, in 1966, 1967, and 1968, the Railroad's actual payments to the Terminal Company were less than the current charges other than rent;[5] if it had been independently operated and had bonds outstanding, it would long since have had to take advantage of § 77 of the Bankruptcy Act. In short, it does not appear that the intercompany charges were either improper or unreasonable.
Much is sought to be made of the benefit which the parent received from the Railroad's losses in its consolidated income tax return, but did not pass on to the Railroad. Whatever bearing this might or might not have on a claim by the Terminal Company in the case of insolvency on the part of the Railroad, cf. Western Pacific R.R. Corp. v. Western Pacific R.R. Co., 206 F.2d 495 (9 Cir.), cert. denied, 346 U.S. 910, 74 S.Ct. 241, 98 L.Ed. 407 (1953), the mere fact that, due to other income of the parent, the ultimate impact of the Railroad's losses may be less than if it stood alone, would not justify requiring railroad operations to be continued at a loss. Only the railroad business is to be considered in deciding whether an operation is unprofitable and should be abandoned. See Brooks-Scanlon Co. v. Railroad Comm'n, 251 U.S. 396, 399, 40 S.Ct. 183, 64 L.Ed. 323 (1919). This same principle also disposes of the contention that the parent, with its other profitable businesses, and the Railroad should be viewed as a single entity for financial accounting purposes, thus purportedly eliminating any showing of loss. Problems of constitutional dimensions would be raised by requiring a company to subsidize a losing railroad operation with non-railroad businesses, see id.  particularly in a case such as this where the railroad business has failed to show a profit for some ten years. For purposes of this abandonment proceeding, then, the Railroad's historical losses are real, substantial, and not exaggerated by intercompany transactions.[6]
Relying on a lease provision obligating the lessor to make capital expenditures *157 with respect to the leased property, the plaintiffs advance a further argument that the serious condition of the equipment used by the Railroad is the result of the Terminal Company's failure to make necessary capital expenditures and the size of the estimated maintenance expenditures now necessary should therefore be appropriately discounted. More specifically, the lease provides that although the lessee is required to maintain the properties at its own expense, the lessor is obligated to make capital expenditures  if not occasioned by the lessee's failure to maintain  with the provisos that the lessor could terminate the lease if more than $100,000 of such capital expenditures were required in any year and that the lessee could either terminate the lease or make capital expenditures at the expense of the lessor if the latter failed to make necessary capital expenditures. There is evidence in the record which indicates that from 1960 through 1969 the Terminal Company made capital expenditures amounting to $786,751 with respect to the leased properties. This would suggest that only a little more than $200,000 additional capital could have been called upon in that ten year period to replace the large amount of rundown equipment being used by the Railroad. Even assuming that the lessee could have called upon the lessor to make additional major capital expenditures and that the result would have been a substantial reduction in the maintenance expenditures now necessary on the part of the lessee, it should be recognized that in fact any such capital expenditures must ultimately be paid for by the lessee since, among other things, the basic rental consists of a depreciation charge and an interest component. Thus, in the 1960 through 1969 period, depreciation charges payable to the Terminal Company by the Railroad amounted to $592,670. Also the record clearly shows that throughout much of that period the Railroad was in default in the payment of rent. By December 31, 1964, the Railroad owed the Terminal Company over four hundred thousand dollars and that sum increased to more than a million and a half by December 31, 1969. Indeed, since 1965, the annual increase in the Railroad's debit balance to the Terminal Company has exceeded $100,000. In light of these figures, it is very doubtful that the lessor has been obligated to make any capital expenditures for some time[7]  at the least, not since the Railroad has been in default on its rent. Consequently, we see no basis for discounting the substantiality of the maintenance expense facing the Railroad should it be required to continue operations.
We have reviewed the evidence before the Commission concerning the Railroad's physical and financial condition at this length in order to delimit the extent to which reconsideration of the specific matters here discussed[8] will be necessary on the remand to be prescribed in what follows. Compare Massachusetts Bay Telecasters, Inc. v. FCC, 104 U.S.App.D.C. 226, 261 F.2d 55, 65 (1958), modified, 111 U.S.App.D.C. 144, 295 F.2d 131 (Cir.), cert. denied, 366 U.S. 918, 81 S.Ct. 1094, 6 L.Ed.2d 241 (1961).


*158 II.
Despite the bleak financial picture of the Railroad's past history and future prospects established before the hearing examiner, we are confronted with a serious argument by the plaintiff and intervenors that the Commission has acted here in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321-47. Although this abandonment proceeding was initiated before NEPA became effective on January 1, 1970, all agency hearings and decision-making occurred long after the effective date. Consequently, we have no doubt that NEPA was applicable. Cf. Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. Corps of Engineers, 324 F.Supp. 878, 880 (D.D.C.1971); Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. Corps of Engineers, 325 F.Supp. 728, 743-744 (E.D. Ark.1971). While the Commission may initially have thought that, as a general matter, abandonment proceedings were not within the provisions of NEPA, subdivisions (A), (B), and (D), among others, of § 102(2), 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2), impose a number of duties on all federal agencies with respect to the consideration and exploration of the environmental effects of their decisions and plans, and the obligation of a federal agency to adhere to these subdivisions in all instances is essentially unqualified.[9] In addition, in cases of "major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment," § 102(2) (C) requires the federal agency to include in its report a "detailed statement" which comprehensively considers the effect of the proposed action upon the environment and alternatives thereto. At the time of the hearings in this proceeding, it may not have been entirely clear from the statute or from the Interim Guidelines published by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), 35 Fed. Reg. 7390-93 (May 12, 1970), revision proposed, 36 Fed.Reg.1398-1402 (Jan. 28, 1971), guidelines published, 36 Fed. Reg. 7724-29 (April 23, 1971), that a railroad abandonment proceeding, despite its potential for increase in the use of alternative modes of transportation with greater polluting effects, such as trucks, constituted the type of federal action which requires a detailed environmental statement as prescribed in § 102 (2) (C). However, the Commission has gone a long way to resolving whatever doubt there was on the question by its proposed rules which include railroad abandonment proceedings among those actions which may have a significant effect on the quality of the environment. See ICC Notice of Proposed Rule Making: Implementation of National Environmental Policy, App. A(d) (2), 36 Fed.Reg. 10807, 10809 (June 3, 1971). And although it is evident that the Commission has been slow in reacting to the directive of the CEQ, 35 Fed.Reg. 7390-93 (May 12, 1970), and of NEPA itself, that each federal agency establish formal procedures to guide the preparation of § *159 102(2) (C) environmental impact statements, this cannot, excuse the Commission's failure to consider adequately the provisions of NEPA once the Act had become effective.
The examiner's report gave no consideration to the environmental implications of the abandonment of the Railroad's operations. None of the protestants had sought at the hearing to develop the record in this respect. The environmental issue was first raised by the City in its Exceptions to the examiner's report. It argued there that if 13,500 carloads  which it assumed to be the Railroad's annual traffic  were moved by truck, substantial additional tonnage of pollutants would be discharged.[10] The Railroad replied that these figures were highly exaggerated, particularly since much of the protestants' argument at the hearing and in their exceptions was not that users would turn to trucks but rather that they would move away as soon as their leases expire, or perhaps even before. Whatever the merits of these opposing views, it is apparent that there is likely to be some adverse environmental effect as a result of the abandonment. Yet the only agency consideration given the environmental issues is the cursory statement of Division 3 which we set out in the margin.[11] In our opinion, this is insufficient to establish compliance with, in particular, § 102(2) (B) & (D), much less with the detailed requirements of § 102(2) (C).
We recognize that the Commission was here faced with a relatively new statute so broad, yet opaque, that it will take even longer than usual fully to comprehend its import. The protestants compounded an already difficult situation by waiting until the eleventh hour to raise an important question which would best have been considered from the outset. Further, we are not eager to remand for what may well be a largely ritualistic act. We have serious question whether, in view of the consistent record of losses and the large sums needed to remedy deferred maintenance and for capital expenditures and the unavailability of any likely source for these, there is any alternative to allowing abandonment here, despite adverse environmental effects. A recent offer by the Users Association, discussed infra, perhaps offers at least a glimmer of hope. But at this juncture the Railroad appears unable to continue, and has operated as long as it has only because the *160 Terminal Company has not pressed for collection of increasing amounts  now more than a million and a half dollars  owed to it. We find no indication in NEPA that Congress meant to authorize an agency to compel a parent or sister company to finance a losing subsidiary or affiliate simply because the latter's demise will have an unfortunate effect on the environment; and there would be the gravest doubt whether it constitutionally could under the circumstances here before us. See Brooks-Scanlon Co. v. Railroad Comm'n, supra, 251 U.S. 396, 399, 40 S.Ct. 183, 64 L.Ed. 323; Railroad Comm'n of State of Texas v. Eastern Texas R.R., 264 U.S. 79, 85, 44 S.Ct. 247, 68 L.Ed. 569 (1924); Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Tax Comm'n, 297 U.S. 403, 413, 56 S.Ct. 522, 80 L.Ed. 760 (1936) (Brandeis, J.); In re New York, N. H. & H. R. R., 304 F.Supp. 793, 801-803 (D.Conn.1969), aff'd in part and rev'd in part sub nom. New Haven Inclusion Cases, 399 U.S. 392, 90 S.Ct. 2054, 26 L.Ed.2d 691 (1970).
On the other hand, such considerations do not justify the Commission's disregard of the law. The tardiness of the parties in raising the issue cannot excuse compliance with NEPA; primary responsibility under the Act rests with the agency. See Calvert Cliffs' Coordinating Committee, Inc. v. United States Atomic Energy Commission, 449 F.2d 1109, 1118-1119 (D.C.Cir. 1971); cf. Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. FPC, 354 F.2d 608, 620 (2 Cir., 1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 941, 86 S.Ct. 1462, 16 L.Ed.2d 540 (1966); Isbrandtsen Co. v. United States, 96 F.Supp. 883, 892 (S.D.N.Y. 1951) (three-judge court), aff'd sub nom. A/S Ludwig Mowinckels Rederi v. Isbrandtsen Co., 342 U.S. 950, 72 S.Ct. 623, 96 L.Ed. 706 (1952). Furthermore, the legislative history indicates that one of the strong motivating forces behind NEPA, and § 102 in particular, was to make exploration and consideration of environmental factors an integral part of the administrative decision-making process. See S.Rep.No.91-296, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News, p. 2751; 115 Cong.Rec. 40416 (Dec. 20, 1969) (remarks of Senator Jackson). See also Calvert Cliffs', supra, 449 F.2d at 1112-1114. To permit an agency to ignore its duties under NEPA with impunity because we have serious doubts that its ultimate decision will be affected by compliance would subvert the very purpose of the Act and encourage further administrative laxity in this area. The systematic investigation of the abandonment of the Railroad's operations which NEPA requires may well reveal substantial environmental consequences and, given that the most recent offer of the Users Association may possibly provide an economic alternative to abandonment, compel further consideration of its propriety and necessity. In any event, preservation of the integrity of NEPA necessitates that the Commission be required to follow the steps set forth in § 102, even if it now seems likely that those steps will lead it to adhere to the present result. Thus, this proceeding must be remanded to the Commission for it to bring itself into compliance with the law.

III.
The plaintiff and intervenors in this action have relied heavily on the willingness of the Railroad's users to submit to a surcharge. At the close of the hearing before the examiner, the Users Association suggested that if the Commission were disposed to authorize abandonment, the users would be willing to pay a surcharge sufficient to enable the Railroad to operate without serious loss. In its brief the Association suggested a surcharge of $10 per car, which it claimed would produce added annual revenue of $130,000.[12] The examiner dealt with *161 this in a passage of his report, set forth in the margin.[13] Under the stimulus of a decision of Division 3 in Wellsville, Addison & Galeton R.R. Corp. Abandonment, 338 I.C.C. 604, served August 26, 1971, the Users Association, on November 3, filed a petition for leave to file a petition to reopen. This time the offer was upped to $25 per car, and was supported by affidavits of 21 shippers accounting for 2,000 carloads annually. As previously indicated, Division 3 denied leave to file. Finally, together with its brief in this action, the Users Association filed an affidavit which, in essence, puts forth its most recent and most substantial offer to pay a $25 surcharge. The affidavit purports to establish the willingness of 94 users, who ship and/or receive some 7,000 carloads annually, to pay such a surcharge.
Were we not convinced that we must remand for further consideration of NEPA, we would dispose of the Users Association's three surcharge offers seriatim. First, we see no basis for quarreling with the examiner's rejection of the initial $10 offer on what little he had before him. The propriety of the refusal to consider the second offer turns on whether the Commission abused its discretion in denying the petition to reopen. While the Court of Appeals for this circuit has held that an order refusing to reopen is not "wholly immune from judicial examination," Cappadora v. Celebrezze, 356 F.2d 1, 5-7 (2 Cir. 1966); see also Blue Bird Coach Lines, Inc. v. United States, 328 F.Supp. 1331, 1337-1338 (W.D.N.Y.1971) (three-judge court), nevertheless, as recognized in the cases cited, the scope of review of such orders is exceedingly narrow. Courts must always bear in mind the warning of Mr. Justice Jackson:
If upon the coming down of the order litigants might demand rehearings as a matter of law because of some new circumstance has arisen, some new trend has been observed, or some new fact discovered, there would be little hope that the administrative process could ever be consummated in an order that would not be subject to reopening.
Interstate Commerce Commission v. Jersey City, 322 U.S. 503, 514, 64 S.Ct. 1129, 1134, 88 L.Ed. 1420 (1944). Here there were no "new circumstances" at all. There was only the fact that the examiner's report had made the likelihood of abandonment more vivid for more users than it had been at the hearing stage. Furthermore, the companies joining in the second offer represented only 2,000 carloads which means a maximum of $50,000 in added revenue, making the doubtful assumption that they would continue their present usage at the higher rates. The plaintiff's argument that the Commission's action here cannot be reconciled with that in the Wellsville case, supra, 338 I.C.C. 604, is without force.[14] There was, in short, *162 no abuse of discretion in the Commission's denial of the petition to reopen. Finally, the newly offered affidavit would, in the normal course, be properly excluded from consideration in this action. "The rule is well settled that proceedings [under 28 U.S.C. § 2321] are not de novo, and ordinarily it is improper to allow the Commission's findings to be attacked or supported by evidence which the Commission had no opportunity of considering." Wycoff Co. v. United States, 240 F.Supp. 304, 308 (D.Utah 1965) (three-judge court), citing Louisville & N. R. R. v. United States, 282 U.S. 740, 51 S.Ct. 297, 75 L.Ed. 672 (1931); Mississippi Valley Barge Line Co. v. United States, 292 U.S. 282, 54 S.Ct. 692, 78 L.Ed. 1260 (1934); American Trucking Ass'ns, Inc. v. United States, 344 U.S. 298, 73 S.Ct. 307, 97 L.Ed. 337 (1953). See also Town of Inlet v. New York Cent. R. R., 7 F.Supp. 781, 784 (N.D.N.Y.1934) (three-judge court); Convoy Co. v. United States, 200 F.Supp. 10, 15-16 (D.Ore.1961) (three-judge court); Oklahoma Corporation Comm'n v. United States, 235 F.Supp. 803, 806-807 (W.D.Okl.1964) (three-judge court). The only exceptions to this rule are cases in which the jurisdictional facts doctrine of Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 52 S.Ct. 285, 76 L.Ed. 598 (1932), is raised or, at least in former days, in which a rate order is attacked as confiscatory. Interstate Investors, Inc. v. United States, 287 F. Supp. 374, 386 (S.D.N.Y.1968) (three-judge court), aff'd, 393 U.S. 479, 89 S.Ct. 707, 21 L.Ed.2d 687 (1969). Otherwise, the court's function in a proceeding such as this is only to review the decision of the Commission in light of the record before it. See Sakis v. United States, 103 F.Supp. 292, 313 (D.D.C.) (three-judge court), appeal dismissed by stipulation, 344 U.S. 801, 73 S.Ct. 4, 97 L.Ed. 625 (1952). It is consistent with Mr. Justice Jackson's views concerning petitions to reopen that parties be obligated to develop the record fully before the Commission and not seek continually to introduce additional evidence. This assures that the Commission will be able to perform meaningfully the decision-making functions residing initially with it and that there is some semblance of finality and orderliness in the administrative process. Indeed, this most recent surcharge offer is a classic instance of evidence which could and should have been introduced before the trial examiner.
But there is, in our opinion, more at stake here than the interests of the named parties. To be sure, the precise consequences for the City, its economy, and its people are not readily ascertainable; but the Railroad's demise will undoubtedly be followed by the relocation of at least some users with the attendant loss of jobs for employees, loss of business for the users' suppliers and customers, and ultimately both economic and physical deterioration in the local community. Against this background, we note the Users Association's contention that the additional $175,000 in revenue ensured by its most recent surcharge offer, when combined with a union offer to eliminate one train crew producing an estimated annual cost saving of $60,000, see note 6, would make the Railroad's continued operation economically feasible. Considered in the light of 1969 financial figures, the Users Association points out that approximately $175,000 in additional revenues plus a $60,000 cost saving would turn a $220,582 loss into a $14,418 profit. On the record before us we could only speculate on the correctness of the Users Association's position  although we do have certain fundamental doubts about its proffered calculations which the parties should seriously consider.[15] The necessity *163 of remand to the Commission for further consideration of the environmental issue allows us to avoid such unwarranted speculation and to give sway to the substantial element of public interest contained in this case by directing the Commission on remand to reopen the administrative record and reevaluate the propriety of abandonment in light of the additional evidence tendered to this court concerning the willingness of users to pay a $25 surcharge.[16] On remand, both sides should present the most recent financial and traffic figures available, thus permitting an accurate reappraisal of the Railroad's future economic prospects assuming a $25 surcharge were put into effect.[17] We consider our action here to be consonant with the general principle that there must be finality in the administrative process; we direct further consideration of the Railroad's financial prospects with the most recent surcharge offer only because we must remand for failure to comply with NEPA in any event.

IV.
In remanding this action to the Commission for further action we do not vacate its abandonment order of December 13, and thus we allow the Railroad to remain shut down pending further administrative action.[18] Although the Commission's failure to act in accordance with applicable law, specifically NEPA, would provide sufficient basis for vacating the Commission's order, see 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) (A), such action is not compelled. In reviewing the Commission's action, we sit as a court with equity powers, and as such
may adjust relief to the exigencies of the case in accordance with the equitable principles governing judicial action. The purpose of judicial review is consonant with that of the administrative proceeding itself,  to secure a just result with a minimum of technical requirements.
Ford Motor Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 364, 373, 59 S.Ct. 301, 307, 83 L.Ed. 221 (1939). See also Addison v. Holly Hill *164 Fruit Products, Inc., 322 U.S. 607, 619-622, 64 S.Ct. 1215, 88 L.Ed. 1488 (1944). The special circumstances here justify our remanding for further consideration without the vacating of the Commission's order that would normally attend upon this. NEPA is a new and unusual statute imposing substantive duties which overlie those imposed on an agency by the statute or statutes for which it has jurisdictional responsibility. Initially harmonizing and integrating the special duties imposed by NEPA with an agency's traditional regulatory functions is not an easy task. What is more, the plaintiffs who now seek to benefit from the Commission's failure completely to perform the tasks imposed on it by NEPA exacerbated the problem by waiting until after the hearings were completed to raise the environmental question. While none of this can ultimately insulate unlawful administrative conduct from judicial correction, in the exercise of our equity powers we deem this sufficient, considering the seriously deteriorated condition of the Railroad, both physically and economically, as established by the evidence before the Commission, to warrant allowing the December 13 order to remain standing at this juncture for a short period while the Commission supplements the record on the environmental issue and then assesses whether its order should be in any way revised. Cf. Coffey v. Jordan, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 113, 275 F.2d 1 (1959).
Even more clearly this is a wholly logical posture in which to have this action proceed insofar as the additional evidence with respect to the surcharge offer is concerned. We have already explored the evidence at length and found that there was substantial basis in the present record for the Commission's conclusions with respect to the Railroad's current financial condition and future economic prospects. Even assuming the most recent surcharge offer so substantially alters the Railroad's financial prospects as to make abandonment inappropriate, it is nonetheless merely additional evidence which could and should have been presented to the hearing examiner. Thus, we do not think that this evidence can impeach the present validity of the December 13 order on the record now before us. At most, under the special circumstances of this case, this additional evidence can and does warrant supplementary action by the Commission  albeit this action may ultimately impugn the continuing propriety of the December 13 order and warrant its revision. Cf. Fleming v. FCC, 96 U.S. App.D.C. 223, 225 F.2d 523 (1955); Massachusetts Bay Telecasters, Inc. v. FCC, supra, 261 F.2d at 65-67.
We will, then, give the Commission ninety days to conduct whatever further proceedings it may wish concerning the environmental and surcharge issues, to make additional determinations, and to serve, and file with us, a supplemental report consistent with this opinion and the record of any further proceedings. The parties shall serve and file any further briefs within fifteen days after service of the supplemental report; we will hear additional argument if requested. We emphasize the need for expeditious action and holding the Commission to a strict time schedule because we are permitting the December 13 order to stand and the Railroad to remain shut down.[19] In the meantime, we will retain *165 jurisdiction, cf. Addison v. Holly Hill Fruit Products, Inc., supra, 322 U.S. at 619, 64 S.Ct. 1215, and will withhold decision of the motion for a preliminary injunction. Upon the filing of the supplemental report and record we shall deal with this matter as on final hearing. F.R.Civ.P. 65(a) (2).
NOTES
[1]  We understand that arrangements were made whereby New York Dock Railway, apparently using some of the Railroad's equipment, handled distressed freight in the immediate vicinity of the City of New York.
[2]  The equipment used in the Railroad's operation is owned by the Terminal Company. Under the leasing arrangement, the Railroad is responsible only for maintenance expenses; capital expenditures with respect to the leased properties are the obligation of the Terminal Company. The cost of rehabilitating all the trackage used by the Railroad was estimated at $553,000. A marine consultant had testified that the operating machinery of the tug used by the Railroad was rattling, and that renewal of this plus other necessary tug repairs would cost $115,000. The short term cost of repairing the seven car floats used by the Railroad would be $280,000. These are all maintenance expenses which would have to be paid by the Railroad, leading to the $930,000 estimate.

Substantial capital expenditures on the part of the Terminal Company are also needed. The condition and age of the six locomotives  four are more than 39 years old; two are more than 25 years old  used by the Railroad are such that it would be more advisable to replace them than to repair them. The cost of the three replacements which would be needed was estimated at $379,700. Similarly, the car floats were 25 to 47 years old and all but one leaked. The marine consultant testified that it would be more practicable to buy six new car floats than to repair the seven old ones. New car floats would cost $300,000 each.
In arriving at the $930,000 estimate, the examiner included the $280,000 estimate with respect to short term repairs by the Railroad on the car floats while apparently assuming that the Terminal Company would also have to purchase six new car floats at $300,000 each. Review of the marine consultant's testimony suggests that he considered purchase of new car floats as a preferable alternative to repairing the old ones, obviating the need for the expenditure of $280,000 by the Railroad. But even after adjusting for this, the Railroad would still have to make a substantial expenditure of approximately $650,000 to rehabilitate its roadbed and marine equipment. Moreover, in the long run, capital expenditures by the Terminal Company are not a meaningful panacea for the Railroad's interrelated financial and maintenance woes, since under the rental terms the Terminal Company ultimately recoups capital expenditures from the Railroad, see infra.
[3]  The only property owned by the Railroad, the rails over 1.8 miles of City streets, is likely to have a negative salvage value in light of the City's demand that the Railroad not merely pave over the tracks but remove them and repave the streets. The salvage value of the leased equipment to the owner is nominal.
[4]  The latter figure includes accrued accounts payable of $1,718,426, of which $1,560,055 was due to the Terminal Company.
[5]  Furthermore, the Terminal Company has never charged the Railroad interest on its ever mounting debt.
[6]  Nor, taken alone, would the offer of the unions to eliminate one train crew have meaningfully alleviated the economic plight of the Railroad as established by the evidence before the hearing examiner. Even assuming the full annual cost of approximately $60,000 would be realized as savings, this would not be by any means sufficient to provide the Railroad with a reasonable possibility of bringing expenses into line with revenues, much less to ensure adequate funds for much needed maintenance. Whether, when combined with steps proposed to generate additional revenues, the cost saving produced by the elimination of one train crew would be enough to make the Railroad profitable once again is a separate question, see Part III infra.
[7]  Thus, while a problem of considerable interest would be raised if a parent used its power to prevent an operating subsidiary from exercising contractual rights against the parent, performance of which might have averted the conditions now requiring abandonment, cf. W. R. Grace & Co. v. CAB, 154 F.2d 271 (2 Cir.), cert. granted sub nom. Pan American Airways Corp. v. W. R. Grace & Co., 328 U.S. 832, 66 S.Ct. 1378, 90 L.Ed. 1608 (1946), dismissed as moot, 332 U.S. 827, 68 S.Ct. 203, 92 L.Ed. 401 (1947), that question is not presented here.
[8]  We do not at this time decide whether the Commission was correct in concluding that the order of abandonment should not have been conditioned upon resumption of operations by the Terminal Company, or in refusing to impose labor protective conditions, since the further action by the Commission which we direct infra could make review of these questions unnecessary.
[9]  While § 102 contains the qualification "to the fullest extent possible," this does not appear to have been intended to relax the obligation of administrative authorities to perform the duties set forth in the section. To the contrary, the conference committee which added this language stated that its purpose

is to make it clear that each agency of the Federal Government shall comply with the directives set out in [ § 102(2) ] unless the existing law applicable to such agency's operations expressly prohibits or makes full compliance with one of the directives impossible .... Thus, it is the intent of the conferees that the provision "to the fullest extent possible" shall not be used by any Federal agency as a means of avoiding compliance with the directives set out in section 102. Rather, the language in section 102 is intended to assure that all agencies of the Federal Government shall comply with the directives set out in said section "to the fullest extent possible" under their statutory authorizations and that no agency shall utilize an excessively narrow construction of its existing statutory authorizations to avoid compliance.

[11]  This, in full text, is

It appearing, That, although a substantial question of possible damage to the environment has been raised, denial of the application herein will almost certainly result in the financial collapse of the applicant, which would, in effect, substitute economic waste for brief postponement of the envisoned environmental damage; and that under the balancing test prescribed by the court in Calvert Cliffs' Coordinating Committee, Inc., et al. v. Atomic Energy Commission, No. 24,839 (U.S.Ct. App., D.C.1971) [449 F.2d 1109], as in accordance with Section 102 of the National Environmental Protection Act, any damage that may occur to environmental amenities by our approval of this application is to be outweighed by the proven economic harm that would result from its denial . . . .
[12]  The Association used for its calculation an estimated traffic figure of 13,000 cars per year which was apparently derived from data available at that time for the years 1967, 1968, and 1969. More recent experience indicates that annual usage has since decreased by more than one-third, see note 15, infra.
[13]  No evidence was submitted in the record with respect to this proposal. The 12 protesting shippers, who are members of the Users Association, were not interrogated, and consequently were not cross-examined, concerning their willingness to pay an additional charge. The $130,000 figure was obviously based on all of applicant's traffic, and the Users Association, which has 32 members, was not authorized to speak for the over 300 other users of applicant's line, whether they are agreeable to the additional charge. Even if all shippers were willing to pay the additional $10 per car, the additional $130,000 in revenue would not convert the deficit operation to a profitable one, and would not provide funds for necessary rehabilitation. Also, there is no assurance that shippers would continue to tender the present amount of traffic at the increased rate. In fact, the contrary may be expected, in view of the history of declining traffic.
[14]  First, Division 3's reversal of a review board in the Wellsville case rested on a number of factors, of which Erie-Lackawanna's offer of increased divisions of revenue with the applicant, 338 I.C.C. at 608, was only one. Also, an offer of increased divisions between two carriers, which can be made immediately effective and will not adversely affect interline traffic, differs substantially from the offer of some shippers to submit to a surcharge on shipments they choose to make by rail, which might or might not be acceptable to others. Finally, the offer of increased divisions in Wellsville was fully developed in the original record, not a belated proffer four months after an examiner's adverse report and when decision was near.
[15]  In 1969 the Railroad handled approximately 13,000 carloads, whereas the very affidavit submitted by the Users Association to this court indicates that in 1971 the Railroad handled only some 8,000 carloads. If the amount of traffic handled by the Railroad has in fact declined so sharply, gross railway operating revenues today must be substantially less than in 1969 unless rate increases have occurred. Exactly what has happened to costs in the meantime is unclear. And even if the union's offer and the surcharge would cause the Railroad's operations to approach the break-even point, there must be some consideration of its immediate need to make large expenditures in order to repair its seriously deteriorated equipment.
[16]  Such a direction to reopen the administrative record to take in additional evidence where remand to the Commission is unavoidable on other grounds is not unprecedented, cf. Jarman v. United States, 219 F.Supp. 108, 119 (D.Md. 1963) (three-judge court).
[17]  Defendants have raised the question of the need for Commission action to make the surcharge binding on all users of the Railroad. Under 49 U.S.C. § 15(1), the Commission may act on its own motion to hold hearings and determine the reasonableness of a proposed rate. In its brief, the Commission argues essentially that the necessary rate-making hearing would be lengthy and complex; the Users Association seems to think not. In any case, we see no inherent obstacle to the Commission making a rate determination in the context of this proceeding. And certainly if the Railroad's traffic is now in fact only 8,000 carloads annually, see note 15, supra, the Users Association's affidavit purporting to establish the willingness of users representing some 7,000 carloads annually provides the Commission with substantial and crucial evidence that the rate increase would not make motor carrier service preferable to rail service. In short, it is possible that the surcharge will be shown to provide economic hope for the Railroad and that the rate increase produced by the surcharge will be shown to be reasonable, and thus we think justified, whatever administrative effort is necessary to investigate these matters.
[18]  In its brief in this action, the Railroad has argued that even if we were to vacate the Commission's order, our actions would neither remove nor be determinative of the legality of its self-imposed embargo. We find it unnecessary to pass upon this.
[19]  That this action to review the Commission's abandonment order has had to proceed with the Railroad already shut down and that we have now found it necessary to seek further agency consideration highlights the preferability of the Commission's usual practice of not making its orders of abandonment effective until 30 or 35 days after service. Indeed, the plaintiffs contend that on this ground alone the order was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) (A). On the basis of the evidence before the Commission concerning the serious economic and physical condition of the Railroad we are not inclined so to conclude. Without doubt, immediate abandonment had a drastic effect on the users and employees of the Railroad. But all concerned had been on notice of the likelihood of abandonment for two and a half years. The Railroad had even offered the users the services of a transportation consultant to help them devise other means of transportation. Delay in the effectiveness of the order would have been of little significance here were it not now necessary to remand to the Commission for further action, and the matters which have delayed a speedy, final determination of the Railroad's future are ones which the plaintiffs could and should have presented to the hearing examiner long ago.

      UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a

Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) decision, it is hereby

ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is

DENIED.

      Zhu     La    Liang,    a    native       and   citizen   of    the   People’s

Republic of China, seeks review of a November 8, 2011, order

of the BIA, affirming the November 17, 2005, decision of

Immigration Judge (“IJ”) M. Christopher Grant, which denied

her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief

under the Convention Against Torture (“CAT”).                         In re Zhu La

Liang, No. A079 399 984 (B.I.A. Nov. 08, 2011), aff’g No. A079

399 984 (Immig. Ct. Arlington, Nov. 17, 2005).                        We assume the

parties’ familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural

history in this case.1

I.    Adverse Credibility Determination

      Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed

both the IJ’s and the BIA’s decisions.                     See Yun-Zui Guan v.

Gonzales, 432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir. 2005).                          The applicable

standards      of    review       are   well-established.            See    8   U.S.C.

§ 1252(b)(4)(B); Yanqin Weng v. Holder, 562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d


          1
            Liang did not challenge the IJ’s denial of CAT
     relief before the BIA and does not meaningfully challenge
     it in this Court. Thus, the claim is forfeited.
                                            2
Cir. 2009).      In pre-REAL ID Act cases, such as this one,

inconsistencies and other discrepancies may form the basis of

an   adverse    credibility     determination   but    must   “bear    a

legitimate nexus” to the applicant’s claim of persecution and

be “substantial” when measured against the record as a whole.

Secaida-Rosales v. INS, 331 F.3d 297, 307-08 (2d Cir. 2003).

The agency, however, may rely on the cumulative effect of even

minor inconsistencies.        See Tu Lin v. Gonzales, 446 F.3d 395,

402 (2d Cir. 2006).

     We   conclude     that   substantial   evidence    supports      the

agency’s adverse credibility determination.           In finding Liang

not credible, the IJ reasonably relied in part on Liang’s

demeanor, noting that she appeared very nervous when asked to

explain inconsistencies in her testimony.              See Majidi v.

Gonzales, 430 F.3d 77, 81 n.1 (2d Cir. 2005).             We defer to

this finding.    Id.

     Further, the agency reasonably relied on inconsistencies

and omissions in Liang’s various statements in concluding she

was not credible.      See Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d 162,

166-67 n.3 (2d Cir. 2008) (holding that for purposes of

analyzing a credibility determination, “[a]n inconsistency and

an omission are functionally equivalent”); see also Secaida-


                                   3
Rosales, 331 F.3d at 308.       Contrary to Liang’s argument, the

fact    of   her   forced   abortion   was   material,   and   bore   a

“legitimate nexus,” to her claim that she had suffered past

persecution, and, therefore, the omission of that fact during

her credible fear interview formed a legitimate basis for the

IJ’s adverse credibility determination.        See Secaida-Rosales,

331 F.3d at 307-08; see also Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 166-67

n.3.    The IJ also reasonably relied on discrepancies between:

(1) Liang’s original and amended asylum applications with

respect to the year in which the abortion occurred; (2)

Liang’s and her husband’s testimony as to whether they had

cohabited in China; and (3) Liang’s testimony and abortion

certificate with regard to the date of the abortion procedure.

Liang failed to provide compelling explanations for these

discrepancies.      See Majidi, 430 F.3d at 80-81.

       Furthermore, the IJ reasonably found implausible Liang’s

assertion that she chose to delay marrying after discovering

that she was pregnant despite her awareness of the significant

risks associated with conceiving a child out of wedlock.          See

Wensheng Yan v. Mukasey, 509 F.3d 63, 67 (2d Cir. 2009)

(holding that where the IJ’s findings are “tethered to record

evidence, and there is nothing else in the record from which


                                  4
a firm conviction of error could properly be derived,” we will

not disturb the inherent implausibility finding).               Finally,

because Liang does not challenge the IJ’s finding that she

failed adequately to corroborate her claim, it stands as valid

basis for the agency’s adverse credibility determination. See

Shunfu Li v. Mukasey, 529 F.3d 141, 146 (2d Cir. 2008).

      Thus, given the absence of corroborating evidence, as well

as the aforementioned omissions and discrepancies in Liang’s

testimony, we identify no error in the agency’s denial of

asylum and withholding of removal on credibility grounds.            See

Paul v. Gonzales, 444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir. 2006).

II. Due Process

      Despite the IJ’s failure to conduct a de novo hearing on

remand as ordered by the BIA, Liang has not demonstrated that

she was deprived of due process during her proceedings. See Li

Hua Lin v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 453 F.3d 99, 104-05 (2d Cir.

2006).   Indeed, nothing in the record suggests that Liang was

prohibited from fully developing her testimony, that any of

her   evidence   had   been   ignored,   or   that   the   IJ    made   a

determination on issues about which she had no notice or

opportunity to be heard.      See id.    Furthermore, Liang has not

identified anything to suggest that the manner in which the IJ

conducted her proceedings undermined their fairness.             See id.
                                  5
Finally, contrary to Liang’s contention, the IJ who certified

the record and returned it to the BIA for adjudication of

Liang’s appeal expressly declined to address the merits of the

prior IJ’s decision, noting that such review was solely within

the purview of the BIA.

    For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is

DENIED.    As we have completed our review, any stay of removal

that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED,

and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition

is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in

this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of

Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule

34.1(b).

                              )  Richard E. DeMoss,

_________________________________________________________________



     JUSTICE HUTCHINSON delivered the opinion of the court:

     The State appeals from the order of the circuit court of

Stephenson County granting the motion of the defendant, John A.

Goebel, to dismiss an amended information filed against him on

January 9, 1995.  The State's motion to reconsider was denied, and

this timely appeal was filed.  We reverse and remand.  

     The State petitioned this court for leave to supply us with

additional authority; we granted the State's petition.  On appeal

to this court, the State raises one issue:  whether reversal of the

trial court's dismissal order is required, based on the authority

of People v. DiLorenzo, 169 Ill. 2d 318 (1996).  The State contends

that the allegations in the amended information were sufficient to

state the offense of aggravated criminal sexual abuse.  We agree

with the State. 

     Defendant was charged by information with the offense of

criminal sexual assault.  The information was later amended to

charge defendant with committing the offense of aggravated criminal

sexual abuse.  The amended information alleged:

          "[Defendant], on or about the 10th day of November 1992

     at and within Stephenson County, Illinois did commit the

     offense of AGGRAVATED CRIMINAL SEXUAL ABUSE in violation of

     Chapter 38, Illinois Revised Statutes *** Section 12--16(b) in

     that said defendant, [a family member] of [D.R.], knowingly

     committed an act of sexual conduct with [D.R.], who was under

     18 years of age when the act was committed, in that said

     defendant rubbed his penis against the buttocks of [D.R.]." 

     (Emphasis in original.)

     Section 12--16(b) of the Criminal Code of 1961 reads in

pertinent part:

          "The accused commits aggravated criminal sexual abuse if

     he or she commits an act of sexual conduct with a victim who

     was under 18 years of age when the act was committed and the

     accused was a family member."  720 ILCS Ann. 5/12--16(b)

     (Smith-Hurd Supp. 1996).  

     The Criminal Code of 1961 defines "sexual conduct" in

pertinent part as "any intentional or knowing touching or fondling

by *** the accused *** of the sex organs *** of the victim *** for

the purpose of sexual gratification or arousal of the victim or the

accused."  720 ILCS Ann. 5/12--12(e) (Smith-Hurd Supp. 1996).

     Defendant was tried before a jury on January 10-12, 1995.  The

State's first witness was the victim, D.R.  D.R. testified to the

events occurring on or about November 8 and 9, 1992, in which she,

defendant, and her sister, Tonya, were at the residence of

defendant and his wife, Darcy.  D.R. testified that the three of

them, D.R., Tonya, and defendant, were painting the kitchen, and,

by the end of the evening, D.R. had paint in her hair and clothes. 

She testified that she went upstairs to take a bath, but, because

the paint was still in her hair, she called to her sister for

assistance.  Defendant, instead, went upstairs into the bathroom

and suggested she go to the basement and shower the paint out of

her hair.  D.R. testified that, upon exiting from the shower in the

basement, defendant had come down the stairs, led her towards a

workout bench, and, with her back facing him, exposed his penis to

her.  He then "started rubbing his penis up and down on [her]

butt."  D.R. also testified that defendant told her that she was

too beautiful for her own good.  

     D.R. testified that another incident occurred at defendant's

residence after a funeral sometime at the end of June 1992.   She

testified that she and defendant went downstairs to talk, but that

defendant started rubbing her back and put his hand down her pants. 

She testified that defendant took off D.R.'s pants, kissed her

breasts, put his finger in her vagina, and then put his mouth on

her vagina.  Defendant then exposed his penis to her, ejaculated,

and instructed D.R. to taste the semen.  

     According to D.R.'s testimony, another incident took place at

defendant's residence around October 1992.  D.R. testified that she

and defendant were in the living room and she had been getting him

beers from the refrigerator when he told her to go upstairs "so

Darcy won't get suspicious."  She testified that they went upstairs

and defendant turned on the television.  Defendant then proceeded

to pull down D.R.'s pants, kiss her breasts and vagina, and put his

finger in her vagina.  

     D.R. next testified to an incident occurring in mid to late

June 1993 at defendant's newly purchased residence.  D.R., among

others, was helping defendant renovate the residence prior to

defendant and his family moving in.  D.R. testified that, on this

occasion, she had just finished going to the bathroom, but, before

she could pull up her underwear and pants, defendant came in and

put his fingers on her vagina and talked about his sex drive.  D.R.

testified that defendant then stopped, apologized, and said he

could not help himself.  She testified they then took a tour of the

house, and, while they were upstairs, defendant laid D.R. down,

took her pants down, and lifted her shirt and bra, exposing her

breasts.  D.R. testified that defendant then put his fingers in her

vagina, kissed her breasts and vagina, and then attempted, but

failed, to put his penis in her vagina.  Defendant then instructed

her to put her mouth on his penis, but then stopped and told her to

get a cup.  D.R. testified she went downstairs, got the cup, went

back upstairs, and defendant again told her to put her mouth on his

penis.  D.R. said defendant then ejaculated in her mouth. 

Defendant then performed oral sex on D.R.  D.R. testified that,

during the ensuing conversation, defendant stated that "he didn't

know if most [family members] did this but he thought they should

because he was trying to teach [her]" about sex.  

     On cross-examination, counsel for defendant attempted to

elicit from D.R. specific dates, times, and places of the

incidents, and whether any witnesses were present.  

     Tonya, sister of D.R., testified next, and she recalled the

events surrounding the November 8 and 9, 1992, incident.  Tonya 

testified that D.R. had taken a bath upstairs after painting that

evening and had called for Tonya, but that defendant went upstairs

instead.  She then testified that D.R. went to the basement to take

a shower, and minutes later, while D.R. was still in the basement,

defendant went downstairs.  On cross-examination, Tonya  testified

as to her employment history, her knowledge of the June 1992

funeral, her recollection that defendant was in the basement with

D.R. in November 1992, and the terms of her visitation with

defendant.  

     The State's last witness was Officer Richard Roodhouse.  He

testified about the investigation of the allegations against

defendant.  Roodhouse testified that defendant acknowledged his

hand "fell against her breast" on one occasion and, on another

occasion, D.R. was getting up from a couch and she put her hand on

defendant's groin or penis.  Roodhouse testified that defendant

said he "didn't remove [either his hand from her breast or her hand

from his groin or penis] right away because he had taken some

psychology courses, and the *** courses had taught him not to do so

because it would make that gesture appear dirty."  He also

testified that defendant acknowledged taking the girls for rides in

the country and talking about sex "because he didn't want [them] to

be naive about sex."  Defendant also told Roodhouse that D.R. had

the dates all wrong.  

     Defendant's brother, James, testified for the defendant. 

James  testified about the events surrounding the June 1992 funeral

and his work schedule.  

     Defendant's brother, Bill, testified next about the events of

the June 1992 funeral.

     Six other witnesses testified that they helped remodel or

observed the remodeling of defendant's new home.  

     Darcy, defendant's wife, testified next.  She testified as to

the events surrounding the June 1992 funeral, the routine she

typically followed, and observations she made during the remodeling

of her and defendant's new home.  

     Defendant testified next.  Defendant categorically denied all

incidents of sexual abuse.  Regarding the November 8 and 9, 1992,

incident, defendant testified that both Tonya and D.R. were in the

bathroom upstairs trying to get paint out of D.R.'s hair. 

Defendant testified that he told D.R., through the bathroom door,

to go to the basement and let the shower water "beat [the paint]

out" of her hair.  Defendant testified that Tonya stayed in the

bathroom upstairs while D.R. went down to the basement and took a

shower.  He testified that he stayed in the kitchen and did not go

into the basement until D.R. had already gone back upstairs into

the bathroom where Tonya was.  After that, he testified, he went to

the basement and stoked the wood-burning furnace and was only in

the basement for approximately five minutes.

     Defendant acknowledged his conversations with Roodhouse

regarding defendant touching D.R.'s breast and her touching his

groin.  On cross-examination, defendant also testified to only two

occasions, occurring years apart, when he was driving in the

country that he talked with his daughters about sex.  Defendant

testified regarding the psychology course that he took, but never

finished, where he learned not to take his hand away from D.R.'s

breast too quickly or remove D.R.'s hand from his groin or penis

because it would make the gesture appear dirty.  Defendant also

testified that on November 9, 1992, the only people painting and

remodeling in his new house were himself, Tonya, and D.R.

     Before the case was given to the jury for decision, defendant

moved to have the charge dismissed.  Defendant argued that the

charge did not state an offense and asserted that the evidence did

not support a conviction.

     After hearing the arguments of counsel, the trial court first

denied the motion for a directed finding, stating that "the

evidence is sufficient that a jury can reasonably find the

defendant guilty of the charge."  The trial court then discussed

defendant's motion to dismiss and determined that dismissal should

be granted because the charge failed to state an offense.

     In granting the motion, the trial court explained that an

allegation regarding the child victim's buttocks did not charge the

offense of aggravated criminal sexual abuse, relying on People v.

Nibbio, 180 Ill. App. 3d 513 (1989).  However, after the parties

filed post-judgment motions, the trial court reconsidered its

reasoning.  On reconsideration, the trial court agreed with the

State that sexual conduct includes the knowing touching of the

victim's body by the penis of the accused.  However, to prosecute

such a charge, the State must allege and prove that the touching

was done "for the purpose of sexual gratification or arousal of the

victim or of the accused."  720 ILCS Ann. 5/12--12(e) (Smith-Hurd

Supp. 1996).  Relying on People v. Edwards, 195 Ill. App. 3d 454

(1990), the trial court,  stated that that element was not alleged

in the amended information and the order dismissing the charge

would stand.

     Before addressing the State's argument, we note that defendant

failed to file a brief in this appeal.  However, because we find 

the issue presented relatively straightforward, we may decide this

case without an appellee's brief in accordance with First Capitol

Mortgage Corp. v. Talandis Construction Corp., 63 Ill. 2d 128, 133

(1976) (holding that a reviewing court should decide the merits of

an appeal where the record is simple and the claimed error is such

that a decision can be made easily without the aid of an appellee's

brief); see also Exline v. Exline, 277 Ill. App. 3d 10, 13 (1995).

     The State argues that reversal of the trial court's dismissal

order is required, relying on the authority of People v. DiLorenzo,

169 Ill. 2d 318 (1996).  The State contends that, based on

DiLorenzo, the allegations in the amended information were

sufficient to state the offense of aggravated criminal sexual

abuse.  

     We are obliged to follow the precedents of our supreme court. 

A settled rule of law that contravenes no statute or constitutional

principles should be followed under the doctrine of stare decisis

unless it can be shown that serious detriment prejudicial to the

public interest is likely to result.  Pasquale v. Speed Products

Engineering, 166 Ill. 2d 337, 349 (1995).  Stare decisis is a

policy of the courts to stand by precedent and leave settled points

of law undisturbed.  Charles v. Seigfried, 165 Ill. 2d 482, 492

(1995).  Additionally, our appellate court lacks the authority to

overrule or modify decisions of our supreme court.  People v.

Woodard, 276 Ill. App. 3d 242, 245 (1995); Vonholdt v. Barba &

Barba Construction, Inc., 276 Ill. App. 3d 325, 329 (1995).  Thus,

it is our duty to examine the DiLorenzo decision and determine

whether the material facts found by the Illinois Supreme Court in

DiLorenzo are similar to or different from those facts in the

present case.    

     In DiLorenzo, the defendant was charged with, inter alia,

aggravated criminal sexual abuse (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 38,

par. 12--16(c)(1)(i) (now 720 ILCS Ann. 5/12--16(c)(1)(i) (Smith-

Hurd Supp. 1996))).  The indictment was in writing, specifically

named the alleged committed offenses, and provided citation to the

relevant statutory provisions, date of the offense, county of its

occurrence, and the defendant's name.  Further, the indictment, in

the words of the statute, stated that the defendant committed the

offense of aggravated criminal sexual abuse in that

     "he, who was 17 years of age or older, knowingly committed an

     act of sexual conduct with [C.R.] who was under 13 years of

     age when the act was committed."

     Following a bench trial, the defendant was found guilty of

aggravated criminal sexual abuse and was sentenced; the appellate

court affirmed.  The defendant appealed, asserting that the

indictment was fatally defective in that the aggravated criminal

sexual abuse charge failed to explicitly state that the alleged

"sexual conduct" with C.R. was "for the purpose of sexual

gratification or arousal of the victim or the accused" and also

that the indictment failed to set forth with particularity the

allegedly wrongful acts that constituted "sexual conduct."

     The DiLorenzo defendant, like defendant in the present case,

failed to challenge the sufficiency of the charging instrument in

a pretrial motion.  Therefore, the supreme court declined to

discuss the sufficiency of the charging instrument when attacked in

a pretrial motion.    Because defendant in the present case also

waited until the conclusion of the trial to attack the

information's sufficiency, we too decline to address the issue of

a pretrial attack of the charging instrument.  

     Instead, the DiLorenzo court stated that, when the sufficiency

of a charging instrument is attacked for the first time on appeal,

the standard of review is whether the charging instrument apprised

the defendant of the precise offense charged with enough

specificity to (1) allow preparation of her or his defense and (2)

allow pleading a resulting conviction as a bar to future

prosecution arising out of the same conduct.  DiLorenzo, 169 Ill.

2d  at 321-22, citing People v. Thingvold, 145 Ill. 2d 441, 448

(1991).  

     The DiLorenzo court determined that the phrase "for the

purpose of sexual gratification" or the definition of "sexual

conduct" were unnecessary to its disposition and declined to

distinguish our rationale in People v. Edwards, 195 Ill. App. 3d

454 (1990).  In Edwards, the defendant appealed two of his

convictions of aggravated criminal sexual abuse on the grounds that

the convictions were improperly charged.  The defendant argued

that, because the charges were based upon the defendant's "sexual

conduct" with the victim, the charging instrument should have

included the relevant provision of the statute, "for the purpose of

sexual gratification or arousal of the victim or the accused."  720

ILCS Ann. 5/12--12(e) (Smith-Hurd Supp. 1996). 

     This court reversed those convictions, stating that reference

to the definition of "sexual conduct" was essential to the offense

of aggravated criminal sexual abuse.  Edwards, 195 Ill. App. 3d at

457.  In interpreting clauses and definitions in statutes, courts

should construe those words in accordance with the statutory

definition.  DeBois v. Department of Employment Security, 274 Ill.

App. 3d 660, 664 (1995).  Because the charges in Edwards were, for

the most part, expressed in the language of the "sexual conduct"

definition and because the charges omitted the element that the

relevant conduct was committed "for the purpose of sexual arousal

or gratification," we held that the charges failed both to set

forth fully the nature and elements of the offense and to be as

fully descriptive as the language of the statute.  Edwards, 195

Ill. App. 3d at 457.

     In disregarding the Edwards rationale, the DiLorenzo court

theorized that, should the defendant have needed to know "some of

the details" of the charge, the defendant could have filed a

request for a bill of particulars.  Our supreme court concluded

that the defendant was aware of the nature of the charges against

him and that no impediment existed in the preparation of his

defense as a result of the manner in which the indictment charged

the offenses.  DiLorenzo, 169 Ill. 2d at 324-25.

     We determine that the material facts in the case at bar are

sufficiently analogous to the material facts of the DiLorenzo case. 

The amended information apprised defendant of the precise offense

charged with enough specificity to allow preparation of his defense

and to allow pleading a resulting conviction as a bar to future

prosecution arising out of the same conduct.  Our own review of the

record indicates that defendant was fully cognizant of the nature

of the charges against him, that he was being tried for "an act of

sexual conduct with [D.R.]."  Defendant called 10 witnesses,

including himself, to refute the specifically charged offense

occurring on or about November 10, 1992, as well as the allegations

surrounding the June 1992 incident taking place after the

relative's funeral.  Though defendant did not specifically defend

against each of the incidents to which D.R. testified, on at least

two occasions in the report of proceedings defendant did offer a

blanket denial of all allegations concerning sexual abuse of D.R. 

Counsel for defendant cross-examined D.R. in depth, attempting to

elicit specific dates, places, times, and witnesses present. 

Furthermore, defendant even secured broadcast schedules from an

area television station to defend against the alleged October 1992

incident. 

     Pursuant to the doctrine of stare decisis, we adhere to the

decision of our supreme court in DiLorenzo and reverse the trial

court's order dismissing the amended information charge against

defendant.  To the extent our holding in Edwards is inconsistent

with this result, Edwards is overruled.

     Finally, we compare the date of the disposition of DiLorenzo

with the pendency of the present case.  DiLorenzo was disposed of

on February 15, 1996, while the instant case was dismissed by the

trial court on May 3, 1995.  The State timely filed its appeal,

thus effecting a continuation in the proceedings.  See 134 Ill. 2d

R. 606.  In reversing the trial court's dismissal of the charging

instrument, we recognize that our supreme court has the inherent

power to give its decisions prospective or retrospective

application.  See Berryman Equipment v. Industrial Comm'n, 276 Ill.

App. 3d 76, 79 (1995).  Generally, a supreme court decision applies

retroactively to cases pending at the time the decision is

announced.  People v. Granados, 172 Ill. 2d 358, 365 (1996).  A

decision will be applied retroactively unless the court expressly

declares that its decision is a clear break with the past, such as

when it explicitly overrules its own past precedent, disapproves a

previously approved practice, or overturns a well-established body

of lower court authority.  People v. Phillips, 219 Ill. App. 3d

877, 879 (1991).  Because the DiLorenzo decision offers no such

declarations warranting only prospective application, its holding

will be applied retroactively, and, thus, DiLorenzo is controlling

in the appeal before us.

     For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the circuit court

of Stephenson County is reversed, and the cause is remanded for

further proceedings.

     Reversed and remanded.

223 F.Supp.2d 286 (2002)
Jeffrey E. SIMPSON, Plaintiff
v.
Cheryl GALLANT, et al., Defendants
No. CIV. 02-15-B-K.
United States District Court, D. Maine.
September 25, 2002.
Jeffrey E. Simpson, South Windham, ME, Pro se.
Michael J. Schmidt, Esq., Wheeler & Arey, P.A., Waterville, ME, for Defendants.

MEMORANDUM OF DECISION
KRAVCHUK, United States Magistrate Judge.
Jeffrey Simpson is seeking remedies for alleged violations of his constitutional right to have access to the telephone and mail services when he was a pretrial detainee at the Penobscot County Jail. (Docket Nos. 1, 7, 8, & 15.) A motion to dismiss filed by the defendants, Cheryl Gallant, Richard Clukey, and Edward Reynolds[1] was denied. *287 (Docket Nos. 26 & 31.) The parties have now consented to proceed before the magistrate judge.[2]
Simpson has filed a motion for summary judgment (Docket No. 38) which he has since clarified to be a motion for partial summary judgment vis-à-vis a claim that he was unable to orchestrate bail in the period between October 20, 2001, through January 21, 2002, because he was denied access to a phone despite his express request to use the phone to arrange bail (Docket No. 52). The defendants have responded to this motion and have filed a cross motion for summary judgment as to all of Simpson's claims. (Docket No. 44.)
I DENY Simpson's motion for summary judgment and GRANT summary judgment to the defendants on Simpson's claim that his constitutional rights were violated when his request to make a collect call to arrange bail was denied. As to the remainder of Simpson's claims relating to phone and mail access I conclude that Simpson has not exhausted his administrative remedies as required by 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a) and, because the defendants press for disposition on this ground, these claims are DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

Background
Broadly put, Simpson claims that while he was a pretrial detainee at the Penobscot County Jail he was placed in disciplinary segregation for violations of jail rules. During the period he spent in segregation he was completely denied access to the phones and he was allowed to mail only three personal letters a week, with postage paid by the jail pursuant to a jail policy. He was not allowed to send additional mail using his own postage.
On January 21, 2002, Simpson was released from custody on bail that was posted by an associate. On February 21, 2002, Simpson was found not guilty on one charge after a jury trial. On February 14, 2002, all additional counts against Simpson triggering his detention from October 10, 2001, through January 21, 2002, had been dismissed.
Simpson's theory of the case is that Penobscot County Jail policies pertaining to outgoing mail and its policy prohibiting the use of a phone for any reason by inmates not in good standing violated his right to prepare his defense and make bail. At the motion to amend/motion to dismiss juncture it was clarified that Simpson pursues these three defendants in their official capacities challenging the constitutionality of the Jail's policy or custom. See Monell v. Dep't of Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978) (observing that a § 1983 suit may be brought "when execution of a government's policy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy, inflicts the injury that the government as an entity is responsible for under § 1983").[3]

Discussion

A. Summary Judgment Standard
Typically the summary judgment standard is phrased in terms of moving and nonmoving parties but in this instance the plaintiff and the defendants are cross-movants. *288 My determination below turns on the question of exhaustion of administrative remedies (with respect to which the defendants carry the burden) and whether or not there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to Simpson's single exhausted claim involving the denial of his December 1, 2001, request to make a phone call to arrange bail. As I conclude that the summary judgment record on both motions supports judgment for the defendants and does not support judgment for Simpson on his motion, I have analyzed the record treating the defendants as the movants and Simpson as the nonmovant, an approach that favors Simpson.
Summary judgment is appropriate if there are no genuine and disputed issues of material fact and if, viewing the evidence most favorably to Simpson, the defendants are entitled to prevail as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56; Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); Nicolo v. Philip Morris, Inc., 201 F.3d 29, 33 (1st Cir.2000). The defendants bear the burden of showing that there is no material factual dispute. A disputed fact is material if it "has the potential to change the outcome of the suit under the governing law if the dispute over it is resolved favorably to the nonmovant." Navarro v. Pfizer Corp., 261 F.3d 90, 93-94 (1st Cir.2001) (quoting McCarthy v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 56 F.3d 313, 315 (1st Cir.1995)).
I must take Simpson's evidence as true, but only evidence that is supported by the affidavits or other evidentiary material. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548. Simpson's pro se status does not excuse him from meeting the summary judgment requirements. Parkinson v. Goord, 116 F.Supp.2d 390, 393 (W.D.N.Y.2000) ("[P]roceeding pro se does not otherwise relieve a litigant of the usual requirements of summary judgment, and a pro se party's bald assertions, unsupported by evidence, are insufficient to overcome a motion for summary judgment."). With respect to material facts (as opposed to legal argument[4]) I have drawn all reasonable inferences in favor of Simpson. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986).
In undertaking the exhaustion inquiry, the defendants bear the burden of proof on this affirmative defense, see Casanova v. Dubois, 304 F.3d 75, 77-78 (1st Cir.2002), and may discharge their burden by demonstrating that their is no record evidence to support Simpson's case on this question, Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548. Vis-à-vis Simpson's constitutional claims Simpson would bear the burden at trial, and, as to any essential factual element of his claim on which he would bear the burden of proof at trial, Simpson's failure to come forward with sufficient evidence to generate a trialworthy issue would warrant summary judgment for the defendants. In re Spigel, 260 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir.2001).

B. Exhaustion pursuant to § 1997e(a)
As they did in their motion to dismiss the defendants press for dismissal of this entire action on the grounds that Simpson failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as required by 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). In § 1997e(a) Congress provided:
No action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal *289 law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.
42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).
In my recommended decision on the motion to dismiss I concluded that Simpson had adequately plead exhaustion for purposes of surviving the motion to dismiss.[5] As anticipated, the record on these cross-motions for summary judgment provides a better basis for making the exhaustion determination. The facts that are material to the exhaustion concern are as follows.
The inmate grievance procedure for the Penobscot County Jail is not disputed by the parties. It is contained in the inmate handbook and provides:
An inmate may file a grievance of an alleged violation of civil, Constitutional, or statutory rights ... or to appeal a previous grievance decision. Jail personnel will provide inmates who wish to report a grievance (consistent with the definition) with a copy of the Grievance form used by the Penobscot County Jail. Completed grievances may be submitted directly to the Corrections Officer, Asst. Shift Supervisor or Shift Supervisor who will sign the grievance indicating receipt of the grievance, to include date and time. Once signed by the Receiving Officer, the inmate will be given a copy of *290 the submitted grievance. When a grievance is resolved, a copy of the written response/finding will be provided to the inmate within twenty-four (24) hours. An inmate may appeal a grievance decision to the next level of command for review, stating the reason for the appeal.
Grievances that appear frivolous in nature or include obscenities or are unrelated to jail operations and activities will not be considered.
Once the inmate has exhausted the internal grievance system, he/she may submit their grievance to the Maine Department of Correction or other review agency for external review. Upon request, jail personnel will provide inmates who wish to report a grievance with adequate writing supplies. Inmate grievances addressed to the Maine Department of Corrections, State House Station # 111, Augusta, Maine 04333 or other review agency are considered legal/privileged correspondence.
(DSMF Ex. 8 at 14.) Though the defendants contend that each inmate is given a copy of this policy upon arrival, Simpson states that he had to make a specific request for one and first had his copy on December 1, 2001.
It is not disputed that Simpson arrived at the Penobscot County Jail on September 26, 2001, and was placed in the maximum security population. Either on October 20 or October 31[6] Simpson was placed in disciplinary segregation where he stayed until his release on bail on January 21, 2002. The only requests that Simpson submitted for telephone access, postage, or attorney visits were dated December 1, 2001, December 14, 2001, and January 6, 2002.
On December 1, 2001, Simpson submitted a request form on which Simpson had written: "I need to make a collect call for bail pu[r]poses. I can not get through on this phone. Could I please make a 5 minute call." This request form was denied on the same date, the officer indicating: "As I already explained to you, you['re] not authorized use of the phone while in disciplinary lockup." On December 1 Simpson filed an inmate grievance stating: "I asked S[e]rge[a]nt Basso if I could use a phone to arrange bail. He said no, I was in lockup. I told him I have a constitutional right to make a call to arrange bail, talk to attorney, etc.[...] I am an unsentenced inmate. I need to arrange bail." This form indicates that an investigation was initiated on the same date and Sergeant Basso responded: "Inmate is in the [Lockup]. Policy F-140 states inmates not in good standing will NOT be allowed access to the collect call phones located in the dayroom areas. Therefore this does not meet the criteria of a defined grievance." In the section of the form that provides for "Action Taken," Basso checked, "No Action Warranted  Not a Defined Grievance." This notation is dated December 1, 2001. On December 6, 2001, Clukey, without further explanation, checked "Grievance Unfounded" in the section of the form dedicated to recording any administrative review and action.
With respect to the defendants' assertion that Simpson did not appeal the denial of this December 1, 2001, grievance, Simpson argues that the defendants have not proven the negative: that the Department of Corrections did not receive or answer or defer an answer vis-à-vis Simpson's grievance. He cites to paragraphs in his affidavit that state that he *291 could not appeal the determination because Clukey had checked the box indicating that the grievance was unfounded. In order to appeal Simpson would have had to ask permission to submit a grievance to a shift leader and because of the characterization of the grievance as nongrievable, unfounded, and frivolous Simpson was denied grievance forms by Basso and two other jail officers. Simpson states that on December 19, 2001, he wrote a letter to the Commissioner of Corrections at the 111 Augusta State House address informing him that he wanted intervention on his behalf. He did not receive a response. Simpson avers that he sent a notarized letter in July 2002 asking for a resolution of this grievance and he has not received a reply. Simpson does not provide any documentation of these appeal efforts beyond a May 26, 2002, grievance form on which Simpson states that from April 30, 2002, onwards he had requested grievance forms three times and been denied the forms and permission to file a grievance. (Pl.'s Reply Mem. Ex 1.) On this form the failure is acknowledged by the jail personnel and the action taken is that Simpson was to be informed that he would be getting the forms. (Id.)
As noted above, Simpson submitted two more requests to jail staff. On December 14, 2001, Simpson submitted an inmate request form stating: "I need to buy some cosmetics off the store cart also stamps. I am in lock up and was told to write shift leader." (DMSJ Ex. 3.) The response on the form is: "Stamp request denied  we will provide you with 3 stamps/week while you are in lock-up  hygiene pack request can be made out and submitted by Thursday of each week. You will have $1 deducted from your account for the hygiene pack if you want a shave card that will be an additional $1. You do not have any access to the store cart for anything while in lock-up. This request is to[o] late for this week." (Id.) Simpson did not file a grievance with respect to this request.
On January 6, 2002, Simpson filled out an inmate request form indicating: "I need to use an unmonitored, non-recorded phone line to contact my attorney. My trial starts in approximately 1 week. It is extremely important." (Id. Ex. 4.) On the same date Simpson met with his attorney for approximately forty minutes. As a consequence of this person-to-person meeting the jail officers took no further action on the request and the form bears this notation: "Inmate's attorney came and visited him on this date (1-6-02) from 14:30 to 15:10  non-contact." There is a check beside "Reviewed and no action warranted at this time." Simpson did not file a grievance with respect to the January 6, 2002, request.[7]
I conclude that the only claim that Simpson has exhausted is his claim concerning the denial of access to the phone to attempt to make bail, an attempt that commenced on December 1, 2001. Though Simpson has no proof-positive of his efforts to appeal this determination to the Department of Corrections, he does have some proof that his efforts to file grievances (efforts some of which post-date the filing of this action perhaps) were not facilitated by the Jail as required by the policy. After all, exhaustion is an affirmative defense *292 and this court has no way of knowing without some presentation by the burden bearer as to the Department of Corrections' record on this matter, whether Simpson has submitted a grievance to the Department. Furthermore, the fact that jail personnel responded that this was not grievable  and they do not back-away from this position in these pleadings  suggests that it is not inequitable to estop them from arguing that Simpson has failed to exhaust. So while I conclude that Simpson has a right to a review of the merits of this claim, the other facets of this action have not been exhausted as required by § 1997e(a). See Nelson v. Rodas, 2002 WL 31075804, *4-6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 17, 2002) (examining status of the case law as to whether § 1997e(a) requires dismissal of the entire action if there are exhausted and nonexhausted claims, concluding that dismissing the nonexhausted claims without prejudice and proceeding on the exhausted claim was appropriate given that the parties and the court had already expended considerable resources on the action). With the defendants pressing this defense, these nonexhausted claims cannot be addressed by this court unless I determined that § 1997e(a) did not apply to this action. Casanova v. Dubois, 289 F.3d 142, 147 (1st Cir.2002) (remanding case for determination of whether remedies have been exhausted, noting: "Although not jurisdictional the exhaustion requirement is nonetheless mandatory").

1. Simpson's § 1997e(a) Status When He Brought this Action and the Unexhausted Claims
The facts material to Simpson's status as a "prisoner" within the meaning of § 1997e(a) are undisputed. Simpson was released from the Penobscot County Jail on January 21, 2002, when he posted bail, only to return on January 26, 2002. He has been in State custody since January 26, 2002, and was housed for sometime at the Maine Correctional Center in South Windham, Maine. Simpson's original complaint and motion to proceed in forma pauperis were signed by Simpson on January 16, 2002, and a jail officer signed the certificate on the in forma pauperis form on the same date. Simpson represented in these pleadings that he was incarcerated at the Penobscot County Jail. These pleadings were docketed by the court's clerk on January 23, 2002, a date on which Simpson was on bail and thus not incarcerated at the Penobscot County Jail.
As indicated in the recommended decision on the motion to dismiss, one judge in this District has concluded that the § 1997e(a) exhaustion requirement is not applicable to individuals who have been released from custody during the pendency of the federal action. See Murphy v. Magnusson, 1999 WL 615895 (D.Me. 1999) (not requiring § 1997e(a) exhaustion by a former-prisoner plaintiff who had been released from the defendant's custody after the filing of the complaint). Other Circuit Courts of Appeal have reached similar conclusions in addressing former-prisoner status and the exhaustion requirement, see Ahmed v. Dragovich, 297 F.3d 201, 210 (3d Cir.2002); Greig v. Goord, 169 F.3d 165, 167 (2d Cir.1999), and other limitations placed on prisoner suits by the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), Janes v. Hernandez, 215 F.3d 541, 543 (5th Cir.2000) (attorney fee limitation of § 1997e(d)); Kerr v. Puckett, 138 F.3d 321, 323 (7th Cir.1998) (mental and emotional injury damages limitation of § 1997e(e)).
Simpson's case is one that requires the court to look again at the question of how changes in the plaintiff's status from prisoner to non-prisoner and back to prisoner impact the exhaustion question. In Medina-Claudio v. Rodriguez-Mateo, 292 F.3d 31 (1st Cir.2002) the First Circuit made it clear that the exhaustion requirement *293 applied if exhaustion was logistically possible for the plaintiff, even if he was no longer a prisoner at the facility involved in the underlying allegations. Id. at 35. Thus, the exhaustion requirement perseveres even when the future plaintiff is removed from the location where the alleged rights violations occurred, but remains within the correctional system. Therefore Simpson, who is once again a prisoner in the state penal system, cannot raise continuing violations in the context of this lawsuit without exhausting his administrative grievances.[8]
In terms of timing, section 1997e(a) clearly anticipates exhaustion prior to the bringing of a federal suit, starting as is does with the phrase, "No action shall be brought...." Thus, pragmatically speaking, the appropriate window for Simpson in terms of the exhaustion of his remedies would have been prior to January 16, 2002, when he completed and signed his paperwork for this suit. I conclude that what Simpson could have done to exhaust his administrative remedies after he filed this suit does not seem to be the appropriate point of reference; rather it is his ability to exhaust remedies prior to the commencement of the action that must be determined.[9]
From the record in front of me it appears likely that Simpson mailed his complaint on or soon after January 16, 2002, from the Penobscot County Jail. Clearly he prepared and signed the filings by January 16, and the record indicates that he sent one legal letter on January 17, 2002. (DMSJ Ex. 6.) The First Circuit Court of Appeals has recently definitively adopted the "prisoner mail box" rule for purposes of determining when a prisoner's § 1983 pleading is "filed" for statute of limitations purposes. Casanova, at 79 ("[We] hold that the mailbox rule shall govern the determination of when a prisoner's § 1983 filing has been completed. So long as the prisoner complies with the prison's procedures for sending legal mail, the filing date for purposes of assessing compliance with the statute of limitations will be the date on which the prisoner commits the mail to the custody of prison authorities.")[10] Whether this action was "brought" within the meaning of § 1997e(a) when it was "filed" on January 17, 2002, or when it was docketed in this court on January 23, 2002, is not determinative *294 because the record now definitively establishes that although Simpson posted bail on January 21, 2002, he was reincarcerated on January 26, 2002, and remains in custody. Thus, unlike a former-prisoner plaintiff, Simpson would be subject to the strictures of § 1997e(a) if the court dismissed the action without prejudice; he would need to administratively exhaust each claim before bringing it to this forum.
For a provision that is meant to lift some of the burden of prisoner litigation from the shoulders of the federal trial courts, section 1997e(a) has proven to be a prickly piece of legislation to apply given the variegations in the status of plaintiffs. See Rodriguez v. Ghoslaw, 2002 WL 1424586, *1 (S.D.N.Y.2002) ("Legislative and judicial efforts to reduce the burden of prison litigation on the district courts by creating procedural obstacles to prisoners' suits can sometimes have perverse effects."). In the present case Simpson has brought not only a claim that he was denied access to a phone to make bail arrangements, but he has also alleged that the jail's policy and procedures have limited his access to the courts by denying him the opportunity to consult with his attorney and the witnesses necessary for his trial. Those claims have not been the subject of any administrative grievances that I can discern. Though the wisdom of the strategy might be questioned in light of the summary judgment record before me, defendants continue to press for dismissal on that basis. Id. at *3 ("Defendant could have chosen to expressly waive the non-exhaustion issue and move instead for restoration of the summary judgment in his favor on the merits. Instead, he seeks a dismissal without prejudice. Under the PLRA, he is entitled to that remedy. Accordingly, the plaintiff's claim against defendant ... is dismissed without prejudice to future litigation on the same cause of action after exhaustion of any available administrative remedies."). They are entitled to that result under the PLRA.

2. The Exhausted Constitutional Claim
The facts material to the denial of Simpson's request to make a collect call while in disciplinary segregation are as follows. Simpson was booked into the Penobscot County Jail on September 26, 2001, on charges of robbery and terrorizing. All inmates who are booked into the Jail are allowed two unmonitored telephone calls after the booking process has been completed. Simpson was in the maximum security population from September 26, 2001, through, at least, October 20, 2001. During this period Simpson had access to collect call phones located in the day room of his cell block.
Simpson was placed in disciplinary segregation initially because he refused to obey an order issued by a correctional officer. Subsequently the Jail extended his disciplinary segregation (running until his release on bail on January 21, 2002) based on a series of subsequent disciplinary charges including: tampering or blocking a locking device; refusing to comply with an order; destroying, altering, or damaging jail property; lock tampering and leaving his cell during lock-down; placing a trash can full of water and feces on a TV stand; refusing to obey an order from a correctional officer; defecating on a piece of paper in front of his door; threatening a corrections officer; possession of contraband; and interference with an officer in the performance of his duties. (Gallant Aff. ¶ 9; Defs.' Reply to PMSJ Ex. A.)[11]
*295 An inmate who violates the jail rules and is placed in disciplinary segregation is an inmate not in good standing. Inmates not in good standing are placed in disciplinary segregation and are subjected to restrictions including limitation on their telephone access. Pursuant to Penobscot County Jail Policy F-140, which covers inmate use of telephones, an inmate not in good standing will not be allowed access to collect call phones except as authorized by the shift supervisor or designee for a bona fide reason. Routine lawyer calls do not constitute a bona fide reason.
With respect to alternative means of communication, inmates in disciplinary segregation are allowed postage for three personal one-ounce first-class letters each week and they have unlimited writing supplies and postage for the purposes of corresponding with attorneys, courts, or grievance review representatives. They can meet with their attorneys at any time subject to reasonable hour restrictions; these are restrictions that primarily require that the attorney not seek to meet with their client at the time when the inmates are sleeping, eating, or during a formal headcount. The intake log kept by the Jail staff shows that Simpson was allowed to meet with his attorney on October 22, 2001; October 28, 2001; November 2, 2001; January 6; 2002; January 8, 2002; January 15, 2002; and January 21, 2002.
Simpson made one request to make a call to arrange bail on December 1, 2001. This request was denied, as described above in the discussion of exhaustion. Simpson asked the jail administrators to provide his associate's address for Simpson and they refused. The defendants assert that Simpson could have met with his attorney on any date that he was incarcerated in the Jail between September 26, 2001, and January 21, 2002. Simpson retorts that he could not arrange visits with his attorney on any day because he was denied phone calls to his attorney.
Simpson's claim concerning interference with his ability to post bail falls under the Fourteenth Amendment umbrella that protects Simpson's right to "post-arrest procedural guarantees" such as bail. See Brady v. Dill, 187 F.3d 104, 108 (1st Cir.1999). Simpson's plaint concerning the Jail's policy of denying access to the collect phone can also be characterized as a condition of pretrial detention claim under Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). Therein the Supreme Court stated:
[I]f a particular condition or restriction of pretrial detention is reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective, it does not, without more, amount to "punishment." Conversely, if a restriction or condition is not reasonably related to a legitimate goal  if it is arbitrary or purposeless  a court permissibly *296 may infer that the purpose of the governmental action is punishment that may not constitutionally be inflicted upon detainees qua detainees. Courts must be mindful that these inquiries spring from constitutional requirements and that judicial answers to them must reflect that fact rather than a court's idea of how best to operate a detention facility.
441 U.S. at 539, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (footnotes and citations omitted). The concern underlying Bell is that the challenged conditions are not "imposed to sanction prior unproven criminal conduct," but are "imposed to enforce reasonable prison disciplinary requirements." Collazo-Leon v. United States Bureau of Prisons, 51 F.3d 315, 318 (1st Cir.1995).
It is undisputed that Simpson was given access to two unmonitored calls when he first arrived at the jail in September 2001. It is also undisputed that he had ample access to the phone prior to his October disciplinary segregation. Even after his disciplinary segregation he had the ability to use the mail to reach individuals to help him arrange bail. He also had unlimited ability to send legal mail. Though Simpson argues that the jail officials were unwilling to help him find an address for his associate (making the phone his only recourse to his associate) this refusal to track down an address is not of Constitutional magnitude on its own. The extra delay of relying on the mail to contact his attorney or someone who could do some leg work for him, after Simpson had at least a month prior to his segregation where his phone access was not restricted, does not make this an unreasonable alternative to the phone and is an adequate safeguard of Simpson's right to arrange bail. See cf. Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 88, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987) (observing, in a First Amendment context, that the availability of alternative method of communication was relevant to determining the scope of the burden imposed by the challenged regulation).
I also note that Simpson filed one grievance with respect to his need to use the phone to arrange bail. Though the rebuff he received could give an inmate pause about the utility of pressing the matter, the record indicates that Simpson attempted no other avenues of either getting the Jail to allow him access to the phone by providing it with concrete information of how the call was going to allow him to make bail or attempting an alternative method of making the necessary contact beyond the request for his associate's address.[12] The record demonstrates that Simpson was able to meet with his attorney and send mail to him and others; surely others were as capable of helping Simpson locate the address as were the jail administrators. I do not mean to suggest by this analysis that the jail staff had no obligation to respond to Simpson's bail request because he had been unable to make bail initially or because he was in disciplinary segregation. A pretrial detainee's status vis-à-vis ability to post bail can change as a case unfolds and the Jail, given the right set of facts, could find itself confronting a deprivation of constitutional significance if its staff failed to take care to recognize the bona fide nature of bail requests, separate and distinct from routine contact with counsel. These facts do not present that circumstance.
*297 With respect to Bell I must gauge whether the restriction or condition was "reasonably related to a legitimate goal" or, conversely, whether it was "arbitrary or purposeless." Bell, 441 U.S. at 539, 99 S.Ct. 1861. First I examine whether the denial of Simpson's request for a call on December 1, 2001, was done with an express intent to punish Simpson. See id.; see also Valdez v. Rosenbaum, 302 F.3d 1039, 1045-46 (9th Cir.2002). The defendants' initiated no action towards Simpson; rather they were reacting to his request. The denial of Simpson's request was pursuant to a policy that prohibited access to the phone for inmates not in good standing. The determination that Simpson's was not a bona fide reason to depart from this prohibition does not support a conclusion that the denial of Simpson's request for a call on December 1, 2001, was done with an express intent to punish Simpson. See Bell, 441 U.S. at 539, 99 S.Ct. 1861; see also Valdez v. Rosenbaum, 302 F.3d 1039, 1045-46 (9th Cir.2002).
I must also consider whether a punitive intent can be inferred from the denial. Bell, 441 U.S. at 538-39, 99 S.Ct. 1861. Here I ask "`whether an alternative purpose to which [the restriction] may rationally be connected is assignable for it, and whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned [to it].'" Id. at 538, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (quoting Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144, 168-69, 83 S.Ct. 554, 9 L.Ed.2d 644 (1963)). The purposes assigned to the denial of the request is that Simpson was in disciplinary segregation because of disorderly conduct including more than one incident of tampering with his door so as to release himself from lock-up (with one of these door tampering incidents occurring on December 1, 2001, the day of Simpson's phone call request.) He was also alleged to have been disobeying orders, threatening, and obstructing jail personnel. Simpson was considered a security risk. Not giving Simpson the special permission he needed under the jail policies to make the phone call is rationally related to minimizing the risk to Jail security. The single denial, particularly in light of the other avenues of communication left open to Simpson, was not excessive in relation to the defendants' justification.
Simpson also stresses that the defendants have admitted that the phone policy/denial of request was partially punitive, aimed at sanctioning Simpson (and presumably other inmates not in good standing) for disorderly behavior. Simpson confuses the notion of punishment of a pretrial detainee for the unproven criminal conduct which is the basis for the detention with the notion of punishment for misconduct in the facility. The former is constitutionally impermissible; the latter is not, so long as the "particular condition or restriction of pretrial detention is reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective." Bell, 441 U.S. at 539, 99 S.Ct. 1861; see also Turner, 482 U.S. at 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254 ("[W]hen a prison regulation impinges on inmates' constitutional rights, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.... Subjecting the day-to-day judgments of prison officials to an inflexible strict scrutiny analysis would seriously hamper their ability to anticipate security problems and to adopt innovative solutions to the intractable problems of prison administration."). As indicated above I conclude that Simpson has failed to come forward with sufficient evidence to generate a trialworthy issue on this claim and summary judgment for the defendants is warranted. In re Spigel, 260 F.3d at 31.

Conclusion
For the reasons set forth above, I hereby GRANT the defendants summary judgment on Simpson's denial of access to the telephone to make bail claim and DENY *298 Simpson summary judgment on that same claim. Simpson's remaining claims are DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
So ordered.
NOTES
[1]  Edward Reynolds is now deceased. The parties have not yet moved to substitute the current sheriff.
[2]  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c), the parties have consented to have United States Magistrate Judge Margaret J. Kravchuk conduct all proceedings in this case, including trial, and to order entry of judgment.
[3]  The parties have provided factual statements pertaining to the issue of final decision-making authority and polices and procedures. There is no meaningful dispute on this score for purposes of making the municipal liability determination and my conclusions below make it unnecessary for me to set forth these facts in any detail.
[4]  Simpson's statement of material facts and his reply to the defendants' statement of facts are peppered with legal argument, including discussion of cases and argument on how I should construe the defendants' answers to his complaint; I have culled the material, properly-supported facts from these pleadings.
[5]  I wrote:

Simpson alleges that he submitted a slip on December 1, 2001, requesting a phone call so that he could arrange bail and/or call a lawyer. When this request was denied Simpson submitted on the same day a Penobscot County Sheriff's grievance form indicating that he was a pretrial detainee and that he had a right to use the phone to arrange bail or call an attorney which was denied by Assistant Jail Administrator, Richard Clukey, who stated that it did not meet the criteria of a defined grievance and it did not present a grievable issue. On an unspecified date Simpson submitted a request form asking the jail administration to provide the address for his associate, providing them with his phone number and this request was denied. Regarding his mail privileges, Simpson submitted request forms on December 14, 2001, and January 11, 2002, concerning his mail privileges seeking permission to use his own funds to send additional letters and these requests were denied.
Simpson has adequately plead exhaustion for purposes of this motion to dismiss. The defendants' argument that he could have done more does not sufficiently controvert Simpson's claims concerning his efforts to seek redress within the Jail. Compare Ray v. Kertes, 285 F.3d 287, 293, 295 (3d Cir.2002) (holding that the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) exhaustion requirement is an affirmative defense and that a prisoner need neither plead nor prove exhaustion to proceed under the PLRA, noting that the Second, Seventh, Ninth, and D.C. Circuits have so held) with Knuckles El v. Toombs, 215 F.3d 640, 642 (6th Cir.2000) (holding that a prisoner was required to "plead his claims with specificity and show that they have been exhausted by attaching a copy of the applicable administrative dispositions to the complaint, or, in the absence of written documentation, describe with specificity the administrative proceeding and its outcome").
(Docket No. 26.)
Notably, since that decision the First Circuit has joined the Third Circuit (as well as the Second, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and D.C.) in concluding that exhaustion is an affirmative defense. Casanova, at 1042 n. 3. A Ninth Circuit panel has just reworked its Wyatt v. Terhune, 280 F.3d 1238 (9th Cir.2002) conclusion vis-à-vis exhaustion as an affirmative defense, adding, among other things, a discussion of the Swierkiewicz v. Sorema, 534 U.S. 506, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002) pleading standard and providing that the defense should be treated as a matter of abatement pursued through Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b) instead of a motion for summary judgment. Wyatt v. Terhune, 305 F.3d 1033, 2002 WL 31103012, *5-9 (9th Cir. 2002); Wyatt v. Terhune, 305 F.3d at 1033 (9th Cir.2002) (denying petition for rehearing en banc and withdrawing opinion published at 280 F.3d 1238).
[6]  The parties contest this date but the exact date is neither material to the exhaustion question nor the constitutional inquiry.
[7]  The defendants also state that Simpson's attorney sent Gallant a letter dated December 12, 2001, indicating that Simpson needed access to writing material and the mail for purposes of contacting his attorney and defense witnesses, and also requesting that Simpson be allowed phone access for these purposes. Gallant called the attorney on January 2, 2002, and left a message indicating that Simpson was in disciplinary segregation for three or four months and would not have access to the telephone but that he would have access to writing materials and the mail. She also said that the attorney could visit Simpson during reasonable hours.
[8]  This is not a situation such as I confronted in Dennison v. Prison Health Services, 2001 WL 761218, *2-3 (D.Me.2001). That plaintiff was a prisoner at the time of filing but was released entirely from custody during the pendency of her suit. I concluded that the § 1997e(a) concern was mooted by her release. Because Dennison raised an acute concern about the judicial efficiency of dismissing the complaint merely to see it re-filed shed of the § 1997e(a) requirement, I found the pragmatic approach advocated in a concurrence and dissenting opinion in an Eleventh Circuit case to be persuasive. See Harris v. Gamer, 216 F.3d 970, 985-86 (11th Cir. 2000) (Anderson, J., concurring; Tjoflat, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Nothing that has happened since my opinion in Dennison has changed my view that the problem of exhaustion under § 1997e(a) has to be approached with common sense.
[9]  I reject the defendants' argument that the date on which Simpson accomplished service on the defendants, April 5, 2002, should be determinative.
[10]  It is not clear whether the First Circuit would conclude that what is good for the common goose (a prisoner-favorable statute of limitations calculation) is good for the rare gander (a prisoner-adverse "filing" date for a § 1997e(a) determination). See also Morales-Rivera v. United States, 184 F.3d 109, 109 (1st Cir.1999) ("We hold that a pro se prisoner's motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 or § 2254 is filed on the date that it is deposited in the prison's internal mail-system for forwarding to the district court, provided that the prisoner utilizes, if available, the prison's system for recording legal mail.").
[11]  Simpson objected and moved to strike the statement of material fact containing the chronological sequence of these disciplinary infractions. (DFSM ¶ 7; Pl.'s Reply SMF ¶ 7.) In their reply to Simpson's response the defendants have provided a sheath of reports. (Def's Reply Ex. A.)

Simpson's rumblings about the disciplinary proceedings and his contention that the Gallant affidavit does not support the statement because she had no personal knowledge of the hearings does not, by any stretch, generate a due process challenge to these charges. Though Simpson argues with the defendants' characterization of the disciplinary process, including whether or not he received a copy of his denied grievance in a timely fashion, Simpson clearly has not and cannot contest the validity of these determinations on due process grounds in this action. See Edwards v. Balisok, 520 U.S. 641, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997); Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). The relevance is limited to the fact that Simpson was in disciplinary segregation for what the jail perceived to be a series of disciplinary infractions and, as framed in this case, a determination that the denial of access to bail claim was valid would not imply the invalidity of those disciplinary determinations.
[12]  Though the allegations of Simpson's complaint concerning access to the phone, mails, and his attorney, taken together supported a claim that the defendant's conduct interfered with his access to courts, this single episode does not support an access to court claim distinct from the analysis conferred here. His other generalized allegations have fallen by the wayside because he failed to exhaust the administrative procedure.

MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
EARL E. O'CONNOR, District Judge.
This matter is before the court on the motion for summary judgment of defendant Mercury Marine ("Mercury") on plaintiff's complaint (Doc. # 73), and defendant Mercury's motion for summary judgment on defendant Holiday Mansion's cross-claim (Doc. # 124). After careful consideration of the parties' briefs and evidentiary materials, the court is prepared to rule. For the reasons stated below, Mercury's motion on plaintiff's complaint is granted as to counts I, II, V, VIII, and IX, granted in part and denied in part as to counts IV and VII, and denied as to counts III and VI. Mercury's motion is granted as to all counts on defendant Holiday Mansion's cross-claim.

Summary Judgment Standards
Summary judgment is appropriate "if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); accord Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); Vitkus v. Beatrice Co., 11 F.3d 1535, 1538-39 (10th Cir.1993). A factual dispute is "material" only if it "might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. at 2510.
The moving party bears the initial burden of showing that there is an absence of any genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552-53, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); Hicks v. City of Watonga, 942 F.2d 737, 743 (10th Cir.1991). Essentially, the inquiry as to whether an issue is genuine is "whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to the jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 251-52, 106 S.Ct. at 2511. An issue of fact is genuine if the evidence is sufficient for a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party. Id. at 248, 106 S.Ct. at 2510. This inquiry necessarily implicates the substantive evidentiary standard of proof that would apply at trial. Id. at 252, 106 S.Ct. at 2511-12.
Once the moving party meets its burden, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to demonstrate that genuine issues remain for trial "as to those dispositive matters for which it carries the burden of proof." Applied Genetics Int'l, Inc. v. First Affiliated Sec., Inc., 912 F.2d 1238, 1241 (10th Cir. 1990); see also Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 1355-56, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986); Bacchus Indus., Inc. v. Arvin Indus., Inc., 939 F.2d 887, 891 (10th Cir.1991). The nonmoving party may not rest on his pleadings but must set forth specific facts. Applied Genetics, 912 F.2d at 1241.
"[W]e must view the record in the light most favorable to the parties opposing the motion for summary judgment." Deepwater Invs., Ltd. v. Jackson Hole Ski Corp., 938 F.2d 1105, 1110 (10th Cir.1991). "In a response to a motion for summary judgment, a party cannot rely on ignorance of facts, on speculation, or on suspicion, and may not escape summary judgment in the mere hope that something will turn up at trial." Conaway v. Smith, 853 F.2d 789, 793 (10th Cir. 1988). The mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256, 106 S.Ct. at 2514. Where the nonmoving party fails to properly respond to the motion for summary judgment, the facts *982 as set forth by the moving party are deemed admitted for purposes of the summary judgment motion. D.Kan.Rule 56.1.
In this diversity case, we ascertain and apply Kansas law with the objective that the result obtained in federal court should be the same result as in a Kansas court. See Adams-Arapahoe School Dist. No.28-J v. GAF Corp., 959 F.2d 868, 870 (10th Cir.1992).
With respect to plaintiff's fraud claims under Kansas law, federal law standards for granting summary judgment apply. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. In Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 252, 255, 106 S.Ct. at 2512, 2513-14, the United States Supreme Court held:
we are convinced that the inquiry involved in a ruling on a motion for summary judgment or for a directed verdict necessarily implicates the substantive evidentiary standard of proof that would apply at the trial on the merits.... Consequently, where the ... "clear and convincing" evidence requirement applies, the trial judge's summary judgment inquiry as to whether a genuine issue exists will be whether the evidence presented is such that the jury applying that evidentiary standard could reasonably find for either the plaintiff or the defendant.
Allegations of fraud must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. See Rajala v. Allied Corp., 919 F.2d 610, 626 (10th Cir.1990), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 905, 111 S.Ct. 1685, 114 L.Ed.2d 80 (1991); Sipes v. Crum, 204 Kan. 591, 464 P.2d 1, 6 (1970). Thus, plaintiff as the nonmoving party carrying the burden of proof at trial must present sufficient evidence of a clear and convincing nature to withstand summary judgment on its fraud claims. See Ramirez v. IBP, Inc., 913 F.Supp. 1421, 1430 (D.Kan.1995); Sprague v. Peoples State Bank, Colby, Kan., 844 F.Supp. 662, 667 (D.Kan.1994); All West Pet Supply Co. v. Hill's Pet Prods. Div., Colgate-Palmolive Co., 840 F.Supp. 1426, 1431 (D.Kan.1993).

Analysis

I. Mercury's Motion For Summary Judgment On Plaintiff's Complaint.

A. Factual Background.

For purposes of defendant's motion, the following is a brief summary of the material facts that are uncontroverted, deemed admitted, or where controverted viewed in the light most favorable to the non-movant, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 and District of Kansas Rule 56.1.
Plaintiff Sithon Maritime Company ("Sithon") was organized in December 1994 for the purpose of obtaining exclusive government issued permits to operate a high speed ferry boat service to shuttle passengers between two of three peninsulas in Northern Greece. In late 1994, Mr. Vagianos, who later became president of Sithon, began negotiating with defendant Holiday Mansion for the possible purchase of four 50-passenger ferry boats. Mr. Vagianos advised Holiday Mansion that the boats needed to achieve a cruising speed of at least 24 knots for the anticipated ferry service and that the ferry boats would run 24 hours a day.
Holiday Mansion advised Mr. Vagianos that the ferries could be powered by either two Mercury 7.3L diesel engines and Bravo III stern drives or by two Volvo diesel engines and stern drives. Mr. Byquist of Holiday Mansion advised Mr. Vagianos that the Mercury engines had more horsepower and would allow the boats to go faster than boats equipped with the Volvo engines. Mr. Byquist told Mr. Vagianos that he would contact Mercury to confirm that Mercury's engines would meet Mr. Vagianos' speed requirements. Mr. Vagianos testified that Mr. Byquist told Mr. Vagianos that he received assurances from Mercury personnel that its propulsion system would enable the Holiday Mansion ferry boats to attain a cruising speed of 24 knots and a maximum speed of 28 knots. Mr. Byquist denies making this statement to Mr. Vagianos. Mr. Byquist testified that (1) no one at Mercury told anyone at Holiday Mansion that the boats sold to Sithon would travel 24 knots cruising speed or 28 knots maximum speed when equipped with the Mercury stern drive engines; (2) no one at Mercury endorsed using the Mercury stern drive engines with the boats sold to Sithon; and (3) no one at Mercury told Holiday Mansion that the boats sold to Sithon would be a proper application for the Mercury stern drive engines.
*983 Before purchasing the boats, Sithon requested and received from Mr. Brown of Holiday Mansion a letter representing that the boats equipped with Mercury engines would have a cruising speed of 24 knots and a maximum speed of 28 knots. Mr. Brown testified that he had no factual basis for making the representation and that he did not consult with anyone at Holiday Mansion or Mercury before making the representation.
Holiday Mansion asked Alan Fila of Mercury for the proper gear drive ratio and propeller pitch for the boats. After consulting with various Mercury employees, Mr. Fila recommended to Holiday Mansion a gear drive ratio of 1.65 to 1 with 20-pitch propellers. On or about January 5, 1995, Sithon agreed to purchase the four passenger ferry boats from Holiday Mansion. In manufacturing the boats, Holiday Mansion set the gear ratios and purchased propellers in accordance with Mr. Fila's recommendations. A Mercury field engineer visited the Holiday Mansion factory and inspected the installation of the Mercury engines and stern drives into one of the four boats.
In February 1995, Mr. Vagianos of Sithon received a copy of a Mercruiser/Mercury operation and service manual from Holiday Mansion. Warranty information is contained in the manual starting at the top of page 84. The actual "Warranty Policy" is on pages 86 and 87 and contains eleven numbered paragraphs. Paragraph 10 of the warranty policy provides:
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS WARRANTY. IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED TO THE LIFE OF THIS WARRANTY. SOME STATES OR COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
Sithon received the four ferry boats from Holiday Mansion in April. On May 19, 1995, Sithon commenced its ferry boat operations in Northern Greece. Within days, the propulsion systems of all four boats began to experience various mechanical problems during operation. The four boats could reach speeds of only 16 knots when empty and approximately 12 to 13 knots when full.
On June 1, Holiday Mansion advised Mercury that the Mercury propulsion systems installed on Sithon's boats were not working properly. On June 5, Jim Puddy of Mercury's International Service Department concluded that the boats required a 2 to 1 gear drive ratio and that the Bravo III stern drives should be replaced with Bravo II stern drives. Mercury implemented these changes on the boats in June 1995.
On or about July 6, the propulsion systems on the Sithon ferries continued to malfunction. In particular, the hard rubber hubs of the new propellers on the Bravo II stern drives melted during operation. As a result of the propeller and other mechanical problems, Sithon was forced to take three of its four boats out of service. On July 10, another Mercury representative advised Holiday Mansion that the 2 to 1 gear drive ratio would over-torque the engines and cause propeller hubs to be more susceptible to failing. In mid-July, Mercury concluded that the passenger boats were too heavy for the Mercury engines.
On at least two occasions in July 1995, a Sithon boat lost all propulsion power. On one occasion, a Sithon boat filled with passengers broke down at sea in the middle of the night. The passengers were stranded until another boat could be located to pick up the passengers.
In early August 1995, Mercury replaced two of the 7.3L diesel engines in one of Sithon's boats with two new engines. The two new engines had lower horsepower than the original engines in an attempt to address the problems of overheating and wear. A Mercury representative observed the installation of these two new engines and conducted various tests on the boat. Mercury subsequently sent six additional engines for installation into Sithon's boats. Four of the six engines were installed. Sithon's boats *984 continued to experience many of the same mechanical problems in 1996.

B. Breach Of Contract (Count VIII).

Sithon alleges that Mercury breached its contract with Sithon for the sale of the four ferry boats. Sithon claims that the following evidence establishes that a contract existed between Mercury and Sithon: (1) Mercury provided Holiday Mansion with information regarding the speed performance of the boats, (2) Mercury recommended to Holiday Mansion the gear ratio and propeller pitch size for the propulsion systems to be used on the boats, and (3) a Mercury field engineer inspected and approved the installation of the Mercury propulsion systems in Sithon's passenger boats. Sithon has failed to present sufficient evidence to raise an issue of material fact as to whether a contract for sale of the boats existed between Sithon and Mercury.
The Kansas Supreme Court has held repeatedly that "[i]n order to form a binding contract, there must be a meeting of the minds on all essential terms." Albers v. Nelson, 248 Kan. 575, 580, 809 P.2d 1194, 1198 (1991); see Sidwell Oil & Gas Co., Inc. v. Loyd, 230 Kan. 77, 79, 630 P.2d 1107, 1110 (1981). "To constitute a meeting of the minds there must be a fair understanding between the parties which normally accompanies mutual consent and the evidence must show with reasonable definiteness that the minds of the parties met upon the same matter and agreed upon the terms of the contract." Sidwell, 230 Kan. at 84, 630 P.2d at 1113 (quoting Steele v. Harrison, 220 Kan. 422, 428, 552 P.2d 957, 962 (1976)). Sithon has not offered any evidence which tends to establish a meeting of the minds between Mercury and Sithon regarding the terms for sale of the four ferry boats. Although Sithon contracted with Holiday Mansion, Mercury was not a party to the contract. Sithon also has failed to come forward with any evidence of the alleged terms of the sales contract between Mercury and Sithon. Mercury is not liable on the contract between Holiday Mansion and Sithon by supplying Holiday Mansion with various parts or even by recommending specific actions to be taken on Sithon's boats. Accordingly, the court will grant summary judgment in favor of defendant Mercury on count VIII of Sithon's complaint.

C. Express Warranty Regarding Speed (Count I).

Sithon alleges that Mercury breached its express warranty that the passenger boats, if equipped with the Mercury propulsion systems, would attain a cruising speed of at least 24 knots. Sithon's claim is based on section 2-313 of the Kansas Uniform Commercial Code ("UCC"). See Kan.Stat.Ann. § 84-2-313(1)(a) ("[a]ny affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the affirmation or promise."). "Express warranties are those for which the buyer bargained; they go to the essence of the bargain, being a part of its basis, and are contractual, having been created during the bargaining process." Corral v. Rollins Protective Services Co., 240 Kan. 678, 685, 732 P.2d 1260, 1266 (1987) (quoting 67A Am.Jur.2d, Sales § 690). "It is clear that for there to be an express warranty there must be an explicit statement, written or oral, by the party to be bound prior to or contemporaneous with the execution of the contract." Id. To prevail on its claim, Sithon must prove that Mercury made an express warranty to Sithon regarding what speed the boats could achieve if equipped with the Mercury engines and that Sithon relied upon the warranty. See Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v. Sonic Development Corp., 546 F.Supp. 533, 541 (D.Kan.1982).
Mercury contends that it never made any express warranty to Sithon regarding the speed of the ferry boats. Sithon's only evidence on this point consists of the testimony of Mr. Vagianos of Sithon. Mr. Vagianos testified that Mr. Byquist of Holiday Mansion told him that an unnamed Mercury representative told Mr. Byquist that the boats equipped with Mercury engines could attain a cruising speed of 24 knots and a maximum speed of 28 knots. Mr. Byquist specifically denies making this statement to Mr. Vagianos. Mr. Vagianos' testimony regarding *985 what Mercury represented to Mr. Byquist constitutes inadmissible hearsay. Mr. Vagianos was not present when the Mercury representative allegedly made the statement to Mr. Byquist. Sithon offers the statement of the unnamed Mercury representative for the truth of the matter asserted. The statement, however, does not fall within any of the exceptions to the hearsay rule.
Even if the court considers Mr. Vagianos' testimony, Sithon has not produced sufficient evidence to show that Mercury ever made any explicit statements to Sithon regarding the speed of the boats as required for an express warranty claim. In this case, the absence of a direct relationship between Mercury and Sithon is fatal to Sithon's express warranty claim regarding speed of the boats. See Wight v. Agristor Leasing, 652 F.Supp. 1000, 1011 (D.Kan.1987); AgriStor Leasing v. Meuli, 634 F.Supp. 1208, 1219 (D.Kan.1986). Although an express warranty claim can be premised on an indirect relationship between the buyer and manufacturer, as when the buyer relies on a manufacturer's advertisement before purchasing the product from a third party, no such facts are present in this case. See, e.g., Cricket Alley Corp. v. Data Terminal Sys., Inc., 240 Kan. 661, 665, 732 P.2d 719, 723 (1987) (citing comment to Kan.Stat.Ann. § 84-2-313). Moreover, Sithon has not alleged or presented any evidence to establish that Holiday Mansion was in any way acting as Mercury's agent with respect to the alleged representations of boat speeds made by Holiday Mansion.
Sithon argues that a disputed issue of fact exists because there is some evidence which indicates that Mercury made representations as to expected speed of boats to two other customers. Sithon argues that this evidence is contrary to Mercury's position that it does not discuss with its customers expected speeds of boats equipped with Mercury engines. Although Sithon's evidence raises a disputed issue as to whether Mercury has made representations regarding the speed of boats to some of its customers, the evidence does not create a disputed factual issue as to whether Mercury made any representations to Sithon regarding the speed of the boats it purchased from Holiday Mansion.
For the above reasons, the court will grant summary judgment in favor of defendant Mercury on count I of Sithon's complaint.

D. Breach Of Contract (Count IX).

Sithon alleges that Mercury breached its contract with Sithon to repair and correct the mechanical problems with the propulsion systems. Mercury first maintains that Sithon has failed to establish that a binding contract existed between the parties. As noted above, to form a binding contract, "there must be a meeting of the minds on all essential terms." Albers, 248 Kan. at 580, 809 P.2d at 1198. "To constitute a meeting of the minds there must be a fair understanding between the parties which normally accompanies mutual consent and the evidence must show with reasonable definiteness that the minds of the parties met upon the same matter and agreed upon the terms of the contract." Sidwell, 230 Kan. at 84, 630 P.2d at 1113 (internal quotation omitted).
Sithon claims that there is sufficient evidence for the trier of facts to find that a binding contract existed between Sithon and Mercury. The court has sifted through plaintiff's reference to 53 statements of fact and underlying documentation, which allegedly support its breach of contract claim. Only two of the statements of fact are even arguably relevant to the issue of whether a contract to correct and repair the propulsion systems existed. At most, plaintiff has presented evidence that (1) on June 5, 1995, Holiday Mansion sent Mercury a letter stating that Sithon is ready to go to the American Embassy and their lawyers regarding the problems with the boats, (2) a Mercury representative stated in a June 5, 1995 internal memorandum that Mercury is willing to do a customer relations repair on the boats at no cost to Sithon or Holiday Mansion, and (3) Mercury representatives told a Sithon representative in July 1995 that the new Bravo II engines would allow the engines to work at the correct RPM. Based on the record evidence, no reasonable juror could find the necessary "meeting of the minds" between Sithon and Mercury. There is no *986 evidence to show with reasonable certainty that the minds of the parties met upon the same matter and agreed upon the terms of the contract. See Sidwell, 230 Kan. at 84, 630 P.2d at 1113. Therefore, the court will grant summary judgment in favor of defendant Mercury on count IX of plaintiff's complaint.

E. Express Warranty Regarding Repairs (Count II).

Sithon alleges that Mercury expressly warranted that it would correct all of the mechanical problems connected to the propulsion systems on Sithon's boats. Mercury argues that Sithon's claim fails because express warranties cannot arise unless there is a contract for sale. Express warranties, however, are not limited to contracts for sale and may be present in any type of contract. See Corral, 240 Kan. at 684, 732 P.2d at 1265. As noted above, "for there to be an express warranty there must be an explicit statement, written or oral, by the party to be bound prior to or contemporaneous with the execution of the contract." Id. In addition, plaintiff must establish that he relied upon the express warranty made by the defendant. See Owens-Corning, 546 F.Supp. at 541.
Sithon's express warranty claim regarding repairs fails for several reasons. First, Sithon has not presented any evidence of an explicit oral or written statement by Mercury of a warranty regarding repairs. Moreover, Sithon has not presented sufficient evidence to establish that Sithon and Mercury ever executed a contract. Although Kansas courts do not require a direct buyer-seller relationship as a predicate for an express warranty claim, there must be some contract. See Corral, 240 Kan. at 685, 732 P.2d at 1266 (contract required); Professional Lens Plan, Inc. v. Polaris Leasing Corp., 234 Kan. 742, 751, 675 P.2d 887, 895 (1984) ("[T]he law permits a non-privity buyer to recover for direct economic loss if the remote seller has breached an express warranty."); Fullerton Aircraft Sales & Rentals, Inc. v. Beech Aircraft Corp., 842 F.2d 717 (4th Cir. 1988) (applying Kansas law, privity of contract not required). Here, Sithon does not present evidence of any contract executed subsequent or contemporaneous with the alleged express warranty to correct and repair the propulsion systems. With no contract, there are no express warranties. Finally, Sithon has not established that it took any actions in reliance on the alleged representations made by Mercury. The vague statement made by a Holiday Mansion representative that Sithon may go to its attorneys is insufficient to show that Sithon relied on any alleged warranty regarding repairs made by Mercury. Accordingly, defendant Mercury is entitled to summary judgment on count II of Sithon's complaint.

F. Covenant Of Good Faith And Fair Dealing (Count V).

Sithon alleges that Mercury breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing under section 1-203 of the Uniform Commercial Code. See Kan.Stat.Ann. § 84-1-203 ("Every contract or duty within this act imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance or enforcement."). Sithon argues that such a duty exists in this case because of the alleged contracts between Sithon and Mercury for the sale of the boats and for repair of the propulsion systems. As noted above, Sithon has not presented sufficient evidence to establish that either contract exists. Therefore, the court will grant summary judgment in favor of defendant on count V of plaintiff's complaint.

G. Implied Warranty Of Merchantability (Count III) And Fitness For A Particular Purpose (Count IV).

Sithon alleges that Mercury breached an implied warranty of merchantability because the Mercury propulsion systems were not fit for the ordinary purpose of being used in passenger ferry boats. See Pl's Compl. ¶ 85. Sithon also alleges Mercury breached an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose because (1) Mercury knew at the time it installed the engines that an express requirement of the sales contract between Sithon and Holiday Mansion was that the ferry boats could travel at 24 knots cruising speed and 28 knots maximum speed and (2) Mercury knew at the time it repaired the engines in the Summer of 1995 that Sithon *987 required that the ferry boats could travel at 24 knots cruising speed and 28 knots maximum speed. See Pl's Compl. ¶¶ 95-97.
Mercury argues that all of Sithon's claims for implied warranties fail because Mercury disclaimed such warranties and there was no privity of contract between Sithon and Mercury. In addition, Mercury argues that Sithon failed to present sufficient evidence in support of its implied warranty of fitness claims because there is no evidence that Mercury knew of Sithon's speed requirements. The court will separately address each of Mercury's arguments.

1. Disclaimer Of Implied Warranties.

Mercury argues that all of Sithon's claims for implied warranties fail because Mercury properly excluded the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness pursuant to the Kansas UCC. See Kan.Stat.Ann. § 84-2-316(2). Mercury argues that no Kansas case has addressed the issue of how a remote manufacturer can exclude implied warranties. Mercury concludes that no "basis of the bargain" requirement can logically be imposed where there was no bargain between Sithon and Mercury. We agree that a basis of the bargain requirement seems inapplicable to disclaimers of implied warranties by remote manufacturers. The other requirements of the Kansas UCC, however, are relevant. To exclude the implied warranty of merchantability, a party must mention the word "merchantability" in the exclusion and, if the exclusion is in writing, it must be conspicuous. See id. To exclude the implied warranty of fitness, the exclusion must be in writing and conspicuous. See id.
Mercury's disclaimer is contained on page 87 of its operation and service manual. There is a title "Warranty Information" at the top of page 84 of the manual. The actual "Warranty Policy" is on pages 86 and 87 and contains eleven numbered paragraphs. The disclaimer at issue appears in the tenth paragraph. The disclaimer provides:
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS WARRANTY. IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED TO THE LIFE OF THIS WARRANTY. SOME STATES OR COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
Mercury certainly meets the requirements of mentioning the word "merchantability" and having the exclusion in writing. The critical issue, however, is whether Mercury's disclaimer is conspicuous. The Kansas Uniform Commercial Code provides:
A term or clause is conspicuous when it is so written that a reasonable person against whom it is to operate ought to have noticed it. A printed heading in capitals (as: NON-NEGOTIABLE BILL OF LADING) is conspicuous. Language in the body of a form is "conspicuous" if it is in larger or other contrasting type or color.... Whether a term or clause is "conspicuous" or not is for decision by the court.
Kan.Stat.Ann. § 84-1-201(10). "In determining conspicuousness of a disclaimer, the court must consider the entire document." Kelley Metal Trading Co. v. Al-Jon/United, Inc., 812 F.Supp. 185, 189 (D.Kan.1993) (citing J & W Equipment, Inc. v. Weingartner, 5 Kan.App.2d 466, 618 P.2d 862, 866 (1980)). "Contrasting type, ink color, and type size are relevant factors in the determination, but they are not the sole arbiters." Kelley, 812 F.Supp. at 189 (citing J & W Equipment).
Although the disclaimer in the instant action is in capital letters, the court finds that the disclaimer is not conspicuous when viewed in light of the entire document. In particular, the exclusion appears on page 87 of an operation and maintenance manual, a document neither party signed and a document Sithon did not receive until after it agreed to purchase the Holiday Mansion boats equipped with Mercury engines. In addition, the disclaimer appears near the end of the warranty policy and is not set off from the text around it except by capital letters. We note that other parts of the manual have been set off with more distinctive features. *988 For the above reasons, the court finds that Mercury's disclaimers did not exclude the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness as to Sithon.

2. Privity Of Contract.

Mercury also argues that all of Sithon's implied warranty claims are barred because there is no privity of contract between Mercury and Sithon. "[I]mplied warranties are imposed by operation of law in Kansas on public policy grounds and without regard to whether the parties to the implied warranty are in `privity' or whether the loss suffered is purely economic when the product is such that it would be inherently dangerous if defectively manufactured." Fullerton, 842 F.2d at 721 (4th Cir.) (applying Kansas law) (citing Professional Lens, 234 Kan. 742, 755, 675 P.2d 887, 898-99 (1984)); see Boehm v. Fox, 473 F.2d 445, 449 (10th Cir.1973) ("An implied warranty will be imposed by operation of law on the basis of public policy and privity of contract is not essential.") (citing Evangelist v. Bellern Research Corp., 199 Kan. 638, 433 P.2d 380 (1967)).
As noted previously, there is no contractual privity between Sithon and Mercury. In addition, Sithon seeks economic losses in this action. Therefore, to withstand summary judgment on its implied warranty claims, Sithon must establish that engines used for passenger boats can be inherently dangerous if defectively manufactured. In Professional Lens, the alleged defective product was a computer and its hard disc component part, which the court found were not inherently dangerous products. 234 Kan. at 755, 675 P.2d at 898. In other cases, however, courts have held that an aircraft and an automobile tire are inherently dangerous products. See Fullerton, 842 F.2d at 718, 720-22 (alleged defect was "abnormal vibrations" on an aircraft); B.F. Goodrich Co. v. Hammond, 269 F.2d 501, 506 (10th Cir.1959) (tire allegedly did not protect against blow outs). Although no court apparently has decided this precise issue under Kansas law, we conclude that engines for passenger boats fall into the category of inherently dangerous products if defectively manufactured. Indeed, on at least two occasions, Sithon's boats equipped with Mercury engines lost all propulsion power while at sea. The passengers on the boats were stranded and subject to the threat of personal injury.
Although privity of contract is not required in this case, Sithon has not provided any authority for the proposition that an implied warranty can arise without any contract at all. Under Kansas law, there must be some contract before an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose can arise. See Corral, 240 Kan. at 678, 732 P.2d at 1261, Syl. ¶ 6 (purpose of implied warranties is to protect party from loss where the subject matter of the contract fails to conform to the normal commercial standard or meet the party's known particular purpose). Indeed, section 315 of the Uniform Commercial Code provides that the implied warranty of fitness arises only "[w]here the seller at the time of contracting has reason to know any particular purpose for which the goods are required." Kan.Stat.Ann. § 84-2-315 (emphasis added).
Applying the above principles, the court finds that privity of contract is not required for Sithon to maintain its implied warranty of merchantability claim or its implied warranty of fitness claim at the time the engines were installed in the ferry boats. The existence of a sales contract between Sithon and Holiday Mansion may be sufficient to create implied warranties running from Mercury to Sithon. On the other hand, Sithon's claim that an implied warranty of fitness arose when Mercury repaired the propulsion systems in the Summer of 1995 is barred. The court determined previously that Sithon did not present sufficient evidence of a contract to repair between Sithon and Mercury. Without any contract in the Summer of 1995, no implied warranty of fitness could arise. The court also finds that Sithon has failed to present sufficient evidence in support of such a claim. See infra, section 3, Evidence Of Implied Warranty Of Fitness Regarding Speed Of The Ferry Boats. For the above reasons, the court will grant summary judgment in favor of defendant Mercury on Sithon's implied warranty of fitness claim with respect to Mercury's *989 repair of the propulsion systems in the Summer of 1995.

3. Evidence Of Implied Warranty Of Fitness Regarding Speed Of The Ferry Boats.

As noted above, Sithon alleges that an implied warranty of fitness from Mercury arose, both at the time the engines were installed and when they were subsequently repaired, that the ferry boats could travel at 24 knots cruising speed and 28 knots maximum speed. With respect to both of these claims, Sithon has failed to present sufficient evidence to establish either (1) Mercury had reason to know that Sithon required water craft that could travel 24 knots cruising speed and 28 knots maximum speed or (2) Mercury had reason to know that Sithon was relying on Mercury to select engines which would enable the water craft to achieve these specified speeds. See Kan.Stat.Ann. § 84-2-315. Accordingly, the court will grant summary judgment in favor of defendant Mercury on both of these claims.
Although the court finds in favor of defendant Mercury on the two specific claims for implied warranties of fitness regarding speed of the ferry boats, the court will not grant summary judgment in favor of defendant Mercury on count IV in its entirety. Liberally construing Sithon's complaint, the court finds that Sithon's claim under count III that Mercury breached an implied warranty of merchantability, i.e., the propulsion systems were not fit for the ordinary purpose of being used in passenger ferries also may be pled as a claim under count IV that Mercury breached an implied warranty of fitness, i.e., the propulsion systems were not fit for the particular purpose of being used in passenger ferries. The parties did not specifically address in their briefs whether use of the Mercury propulsion systems in passenger ferry boats is an ordinary or particular use of the systems. Therefore, the court will not dismiss count IV in its entirety at this time. For all of the above reasons, the court will deny Mercury's motion for summary judgment on counts III and IV with respect to Sithon's claim of an implied warranty that the Mercury propulsion systems were not fit for the purpose of being used in passenger ferries. The court will grant summary judgment in favor of Mercury on count IV of Sithon's complaint with respect to Sithon's claim of implied warranties of fitness, both at the time the engines were installed and when they were subsequently repaired, that the water craft would achieve a cruising speed of 24 knots and a maximum speed of 28 knots.

H. Fraud (Count VII).

Sithon alleges in its complaint that Mercury failed to inform Sithon, both at the time Mercury originally installed the propulsion systems and when it subsequently repaired the propulsion systems, that the boats sold could not reach speeds of 24 knots cruising speed and 28 knots maximum speed. See Pl's Compl. ¶¶ 126-27, 129-30. These two related fraud claims are based on the legal theory of fraud through silence. To prevail on a claim of fraud through silence, plaintiff must show by clear and convincing evidence:
(1) defendant had knowledge of material facts which plaintiff did not have and which plaintiff could not have discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence;
(2) defendant was under an obligation to communicate the material facts to the plaintiff;
(3) defendant intentionally failed to communicate to plaintiff the material facts;
(4) plaintiff justifiably relied on defendant to communicate the material facts to plaintiff; and
(5) plaintiff sustained damages as a result of defendant's failure to communicate the material facts to the plaintiff. [citation omitted.]
OMI Holdings, Inc. v. Howell, 260 Kan. 305, 344-45, 918 P.2d 1274, 1299 (1996) (quoting Lesser v. Neosho County Community College, 741 F.Supp. 854, 863 (D.Kan.1990)). The court will analyze the above elements separately with respect to each fraud claim.


*990 1. Disclosure Of Speeds At Time Of Engine Installation.

Sithon first argues that Mercury failed to inform Sithon at the time Mercury installed the engines that the boats equipped with the Mercury propulsion systems could not reach speeds of 24 knots cruising speed and 28 knots maximum speed. Mercury argues that none of the evidence presented by Sithon in its opposition memorandum is relevant to this claim. The court agrees. Sithon has failed to present clear and convincing evidence in support of its fraud claim. First, Sithon has not presented any evidence that Mercury knew at the time the engines were installed what speeds the boats could achieve if equipped with the Mercury propulsion systems. Sithon also has not established that it could not have discovered this information by the exercise of reasonable diligence. Sithon likewise has failed to present any evidence in support of the other elements of a fraudulent omission claim. In particular, Sithon has failed to present any evidence that Mercury intentionally withheld any speed estimates of the boats from Sithon at the time of engine installation or that Sithon justifiably relied on Mercury to communicate this information. In light of the lack of evidence presented by Sithon, the court will grant summary judgment in favor of defendant Mercury on Sithon's claim that Mercury failed to disclose at the time Mercury installed the engines that the boats could not achieve a cruising speed of 24 knots and a maximum speed of 28 knots. See Pl's Compl. ¶¶ 126-27.

2. Disclosure Of Speeds At Time Of Repair.

Sithon also contends that Mercury failed to inform Sithon at the time of repair in the Summer of 1995 that the boats equipped with the repaired Mercury propulsion systems could not reach speeds of 24 knots cruising speed and 28 knots maximum speed. Sithon has presented some evidence in support of this claim in its opposition memorandum. Sithon has presented evidence that (1) Mercury knew what speed the boats could achieve after repair and replacement of the propulsion systems, (2) Mercury knew that some of the repairs and changes would reduce the cruising speed of the boats, and (3) Mercury failed to advise Sithon of this information. In their voluminous briefs, neither party specifically discussed this claim factually or with respect to the legal elements of a fraudulent omission claim. Therefore, the court will deny defendant Mercury's motion for summary judgment on this claim.
Although the court will not grant summary judgment on Sithon's second fraud claim, the court doubts that the record evidence would be sufficient to withstand a properly supported motion for judgment as a matter of law. In particular, there does not appear to be any record evidence which establishes that (1) Sithon could not have discovered the information regarding speed of the boats by the exercise of reasonable diligence or (2) Sithon justifiably relied on Mercury to communicate such information.
Mercury argues in the alternative that Sithon should be required to replead its fraud claim with particularity. The court finds that Sithon's complaint provides Mercury sufficient notice of the particular fraud allegation. The requirement that fraud shall be stated with particularity primarily is to allow the defendant to prepare an adequate responsive pleading. See Todaro v. Orbit Int'l Travel, Ltd., 755 F.Supp. 1229, 1234 (S.D.N.Y.1991); United Nat'l Records, Inc. v. MCA, Inc., 609 F.Supp. 33, 38 (N.D.Ill. 1984). By analogy to the time requirements for pleading defenses under rule 12, a rule 9(b) objection is waived unless made as a separate motion prior to or concurrent with the filing of a responsive pleading. See Todaro, 755 F.Supp. at 1234; MCA, 609 F.Supp. at 38-39. Here, Mercury was on sufficient notice of Sithon's fraud allegations to prepare a detailed answer. Although Mercury raised a general objection under rule 9(b) in its answer, there is no evidence to suggest that Mercury was precluded from drafting an adequate responsive pleading because of the lack of particularity in Sithon's fraud claims. Of course, Sithon may be required to state its fraud claim with more particularity in the pretrial order.


*991 3. Sithon's New Fraud Theories.

Sithon alleges numerous new fraud theories in its opposition brief and its surreply memorandum. In sum, Sithon argues that Mercury withheld information of the shortcomings of the propulsion systems, knew that it could never repair or improve the performance of the propulsion systems, and nevertheless assured Sithon that it would correct the performance problems. Sithon argues that it relied on Mercury's repeated assurances and accordingly suffered the destruction of its business. Sithon cannot change its fraud theory at this late date. At this point, there is no pretrial order in the case. Pursuant to the Scheduling Order, however, any motions to amend the pleadings by the plaintiff were due on January 2, 1997. Plaintiff has not filed any motions to amend or motions to extend the deadline for filing motions to amend. Therefore, plaintiff's fraud claims are governed by its complaint. The court will not consider the new fraud theories presented in plaintiff's opposition memoranda. Plaintiff cannot present claims that are "moving targets," particularly with respect to claims of fraud which are governed by a heightened standard of pleading.
In a footnote, Sithon requests leave to amend its fraud claims to add several new fraud theories. The court will deny Sithon's request for the reasons set forth above. In addition, Sithon has failed to comply with rule 15.1 of the Rules of Practice for the District of Kansas governing motions to amend the pleadings. In particular, Sithon failed to set forth a concise statement of the amendment sought and failed to provide a copy of the proposed amended complaint to the court. Without briefing on the motion or a copy of the proposed amended complaint, the court cannot analyze many of the factors relevant to motions to amend, such as Sithon's delay in seeking the amendment or any prejudice to Mercury. See Castleglen, Inc. v. Resolution Trust Corp., 984 F.2d 1571, 1585 (10th Cir.1993). Based on the record before us, however, we note that any proposed amendment by Sithon to add the referenced fraud claims likely would be futile. Sithon has not set forth facts which establish that (1) Mercury was under an obligation to communicate the material facts to Sithon, (2) Mercury intentionally failed to communicate the material facts to Sithon, or (3) Sithon justifiably relied on Mercury to communicate the facts to Sithon. For the above reasons, Sithon's request to amend its complaint is denied.

I. Strict Liability In Tort (Count VI).

Sithon alleges that the Mercury propulsion systems were defective and unreasonably dangerous to Sithon's boats. Sithon, as the ultimate purchaser of the propulsion systems, claims that Mercury is responsible for any damages from the propulsion systems under the legal theory of strict liability. Mercury moves for summary judgment on the ground that Sithon suffered only economic loss and therefore cannot recover in tort.
In Kansas, "an action for damages from a product's qualitative defects alone without proof of the product's dangerousness cannot sound in tort." Daitom, Inc. v. Pennwalt Corp., 741 F.2d 1569, 1581 (10th Cir.1984); see Winchester v. Lester's of Minnesota, Inc., 983 F.2d 992, 996 (10th Cir.1993); AgriStor Leasing v. Meuli, 634 F.Supp. 1208, 1217 (D.Kan.1986). Thus, the repair or replacement of a defective product itself is considered economic loss for which a plaintiff generally cannot recover in tort. See Winchester, 983 F.2d at 996 (citing East River Steamship Corp. v. Transamerica Delaval, Inc., 476 U.S. 858, 871, 106 S.Ct. 2295, 2302, 90 L.Ed.2d 865 (1986)). Here, Sithon seeks recovery for damage to the propulsion systems and the water craft, as well as lost profits resulting from the failure of the propulsion systems.
Although damage to a defective product itself often is characterized as economic loss, courts have allowed recovery of such losses if the product was "unreasonably dangerous." See Champlain Enterprises. Inc. v. United States, 945 F.Supp. 468, (N.D.N.Y.1996) (applying Kansas law) (plaintiff can recover for damage to the aircraft if plaintiff establishes that the aircraft was unreasonably dangerous); Fordyce Concrete, Inc. v. Mack Trucks, Inc., 535 F.Supp. 118, 126 (D.Kan.1982) (physical damage upon a defective product or upon other property resulting from an unreasonably *992 dangerous defective product is recoverable); see also Elite Professionals, Inc. v. Carrier Corp., 16 Kan.App.2d 625, 625, 633, 827 P.2d 1195, 1197, 1202 (1992) (damage to meat inside refrigeration unit did not constitute economic loss, issue of fact as to whether truck refrigeration unit was unreasonably dangerous); Mississippi Power & Light Co. v. Branson Aircraft Corp., 797 F.Supp. 871, 873 (D.Colo.1992) (applying Kansas law) ("tort recovery for injury to the defective product is not barred by the economic loss rule if the plaintiff is attempting to recover property damages, as distinguished from purely economic damages."). In Fordyce, we held that "the Kansas Supreme Court, if faced with the question before us, would once again follow the explicit language of § 402A [of the Restatement (Second) of Torts] and allow plaintiff to recover for physical damage to property resulting from an unreasonably dangerous defective product regardless of whether the damage is inflicted upon the defective product or upon other property." In Fordyce, we relied on Kansas cases that consistently interpreted section 402A broadly, permitting expansive recovery under a strict liability in tort theory. See id.; Kennedy v. City of Sawyer, 228 Kan. 439, 445-46, 618 P.2d 788, 794 (1980) (imposing liability for property damage incurred by bystanders or third parties under strict liability "is based on a desire to achieve maximum protection for the injured party and to promote the public interest in discouraging the marketing of products having defects that are a menace to the public.").
We now must decide whether Sithon has presented sufficient evidence that Mercury's propulsion systems were unreasonably dangerous to survive summary judgment. The Kansas Supreme Court has found that a condition is unreasonably dangerous "if it is dangerous when used in the way it is ordinarily used considering the product's characteristics and common usage, and is dangerous to the extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchased it, with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to its characteristics." Jenkins v. Amchem Prods., Inc., 256 Kan. 602, 623-24, 886 P.2d 869, 882 (1994), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 116 S.Ct. 80, 133 L.Ed.2d 38 (1995). Mercury has not offered any evidence to controvert Sithon's evidence that its passenger boats lost all propulsion power on two occasions and broke down while at sea. On one occasion, the boat filled with passengers broke down in the middle of the night. The passengers were stranded, frightened, and many of them were screaming because of the threat of personal injury. Based on the record evidence, we cannot conclude as a matter of law that the Mercury propulsion systems were not unreasonably dangerous. If Sithon establishes at trial that the Mercury propulsion systems were unreasonably dangerous, Sithon may be able to recover on its strict liability claims for damages to the propulsion systems and its water craft. Neither party has addressed whether Sithon also can recover lost profits in the event it can establish that the propulsion systems were unreasonably dangerous. In light of the absence of briefing on this point, the court will not decide the issue at this time. For all of the above reasons, the court will deny Mercury's motion for summary judgment as to count VI of Sithon's complaint.

II. Mercury's Motion For Summary Judgment On Holiday Mansion's Cross-Claim.
Mercury has filed a motion for summary judgment on Holiday Mansion's cross-claim. Holiday Mansion has failed to file a response to this motion. Pursuant to rule 7.4 of the Rules of Practice for the District of Kansas, the court will consider defendant's motion as uncontested. Ordinarily, such motions are granted without further notice.

A. Factual Background.

For purposes of defendant's motion, the following is a brief summary of the material facts that are uncontroverted, deemed admitted, or where controverted viewed in the light most favorable to the non-movant, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 and District of Kansas Rule 56.1.
Mr. Byquist, Holiday Mansion's vice president and individual in charge of the day-to-day operations of the company, testified that *993 he did not know if Holiday Mansion's allegation that Mercury represented what specific speeds Sithon's boats could achieve was true or the basis of the allegation. Mr. Byquist also testified that (1) no one at Mercury told anyone at Holiday Mansion that the boats sold to Sithon would travel 24 knots cruising speed or 28 knots maximum speed, or at any speed, when equipped with the Mercury stern drive engines; (2) no one at Mercury endorsed using the Mercury stern drive engines with the boats sold to Sithon; and (3) no one at Mercury told Holiday Mansion that the boats sold to Sithon would be a proper application for the Mercury stern drive engines. Mr. Brown of Holiday Mansion faxed a letter to Sithon on January 3, 1995, representing that the boats equipped with Mercury engines would have a cruising speed of 24 knots and a maximum speed of 28 knots. Mr. Brown testified that he had no factual basis for making the representation and that he did not consult with anyone at Holiday Mansion or Mercury before making the representation.

B. Breach Of Express Warranty (Count I).

Holiday Mansion alleges that Mercury expressly warranted that the engines would reasonably and properly perform. As noted previously, to prevail on an express warranty claim, a party must establish (1) there was an explicit written or oral statement of warranty prior to or contemporaneous with the execution of a contract and (2) reliance on the warranty statement. See Owens-Corning, 546 F.Supp. at 541.
The only record evidence of an express warranty by Mercury to Holiday Mansion is contained in Mercury's operation and service manual. The warranty provides in relevant part that the Mercury stern drive power package, inboard engine, and accessories are warranted "to be free from defects in material and workmanship. This warranty shall apply only to pleasure craft and light-duty craft applications." Holiday Mansion has not offered any evidence suggesting either that (1) the Mercury engines and stern drives failed because of a defect in materials or workmanship or (2) the Mercury propulsion systems were used in a "light-duty craft" application. In the absence of such evidence, Holiday Mansion cannot establish that Mercury breached its express warranty. Indeed, the only record evidence on this point suggests that Mercury fulfilled its warranty obligations by supplying replacement engines and drive units for the boats at virtually no cost to Sithon or Holiday Mansion. Therefore, the court will grant summary judgment in favor of Mercury on count I of Holiday Mansion's cross-claim.

C. Negligent Misrepresentation (Count II).

Holiday Mansion alleges that Mercury negligently misrepresented that the 49-foot passenger boats, "when loaded with passengers, fuel and other miscellaneous items, could reasonably and appropriately operate for needed periods of time at cruising speed in excess of 20 knots [] with a maximum speed in excess of 24 knots." To prevail on its claim, Holiday Mansion must establish: (1) Mercury supplied false information to Holiday Mansion to benefit and guide Holiday Mansion in a business transaction; (2) Mercury intended to influence the transaction by providing the information; (3) Mercury was negligent in obtaining or communicating the information; and (4) Holiday Mansion reasonably relied and acted upon the information which caused Holiday Mansion to suffer damages. See Mahler v. Keenan Real Estate, Inc., 255 Kan. 593, 604, 876 P.2d 609, 616 (1994) (adopting section 552 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts).
Holiday Mansion has not presented any evidence that Mercury ever made the alleged representation regarding speed. Indeed, Holiday Mansion's representatives testified that no such representation was made. Mr. Byquist, Holiday Mansion's vice president and individual in charge of the day-to-day operations of the company, testified that he did not know if Holiday Mansion's allegation was true or the basis of the allegation. Mr. Byquist also testified that (1) no one at Mercury told anyone at Holiday Mansion that the boats sold to Sithon would travel 24 knots cruising speed or 28 knots maximum speed, or at any speed, when equipped with the *994 Mercury stern drive engines; (2) no one at Mercury endorsed using the Mercury stern drive engines with the boats sold to Sithon; and (3) no one at Mercury told Holiday Mansion that the boats sold to Sithon would be a proper application for the Mercury stern drive engines. Finally, Mr. Brown of Holiday Mansion faxed a letter to Sithon on January 3, 1995, representing that the boats would have a cruising speed of 24 knots and a maximum speed of 28 knots. Mr. Brown testified that he had no factual basis for making the representation and that he did not consult with anyone at Holiday Mansion or Mercury before making the representation. In light of the above evidence, no reasonable juror could find that Mercury supplied Holiday Mansion with false information. Accordingly, the court will grant summary judgment in favor of Mercury on count II of Holiday Mansion's cross-claim.

D. Negligence (Count III).

Holiday Mansion alleges that Mercury "failed to use appropriate and reasonable care in selecting the Mercury engines and stern drives it did, which would not and could not operate at the desired cruising and maximum speeds." Holiday Mansion also alleges that Mercury "negligently and improperly failed to undertake and perform any and all testing that was needed to ascertain and make certain that its representations were reasonable and appropriate." Holiday Mansion has not presented any evidence in support of these allegations. First, the uncontested evidence establishes that no one at Mercury represented to Holiday Mansion that the boats could achieve certain cruising or maximum speeds and that no one at Mercury was aware of the desired cruising and maximum speeds. Moreover, Holiday Mansion has not presented any evidence suggesting that Mercury was negligent in selecting the engines for the passenger boats. For the above reasons, the court will grant summary judgment in favor of Mercury on count III of Holiday Mansion's cross-claim.

E. Common Law Indemnity (Count IV).

Holiday Mansion claims that it is entitled to indemnity from Mercury for any judgment that may be entered against Holiday Mansion on Sithon's claims. Mercury argues that Holiday Mansion has no legal right to indemnity under Kansas law. There is no evidence of any indemnity agreement between Holiday Mansion and Mercury. In addition, "the statutory adoption of comparative negligence in Kansas has had the effect of abrogating the concept of indemnification based on the dichotomy of active/passive negligence." Haysville U.S.D. No. 261 v. GAF Corp., 233 Kan. 635, 642, 666 P.2d 192, 199 (1983) (citation omitted). In the absence of any factual or legal basis for indemnification, the court will grant summary judgment in favor of defendant Mercury on count IV of Holiday Mansion's cross-claim.
IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that defendant Mercury Marine's motion for summary judgment on plaintiff's complaint (Doc. # 73) is granted as to counts I, II, V, VIII, and IX, granted in part and denied in part as to counts IV and VII as discussed herein, and denied as to counts III and VI.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that defendant Mercury Marine's motion for summary judgment on defendant Holiday Mansion's Cross-Claim (Doc. # 124) is granted.

Jean Patrick MICHEL, Petitioner
v.
IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE, Respondent
No. 4:CV-99-1879.
United States District Court, M.D. Pennsylvania.
November 3, 2000.

MEMORANDUM
McCLURE, District Judge.

BACKGROUND:
On October 22, 1999, petitioner Jean Patrick Michel, acting pro se, commenced this action by filing a document denominated "Motion for bond/relief under 28 U.S.C. [§] 2241." Michel is a native and citizen of Haiti who is currently a detainee of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). He is subject to a final order *486 of deportation issued December 3, 1997, but INS has not been able to effectuate the deportation, apparently due to slow action on the part of Haiti. Succinctly stated, Michel seeks release on bond pending his removal.
Before the court is the report and recommendation of U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas M. Blewitt, which recommends that the petition be denied.

DISCUSSION:

I. STANDARD
A district court is required to review de novo those portions of a magistrate judge's report to which objections are made. Commonwealth of Penna. v. United States, 581 F.Supp. 1238, 1239 (M.D.Pa.1984); 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1). When no objections are filed to the report of a magistrate judge, a court has discretion to review that report as it deems appropriate. A magistrate judge's finding or ruling on a motion or issue properly becomes the holding of the court unless objections are filed. Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). However, the district court may not grant a motion for summary judgment, Fed.R.Civ.P. 56, or a motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) solely because the motion is unopposed; such motions are subject to review for merit. Stackhouse v. Mazurkiewicz, 951 F.2d 29, 30 (3d Cir. 1991); Anchorage Associates v. Virgin Islands Board of Tax Review, 922 F.2d 168, 174 (3d Cir.1990).
Michel has filed objections to the report and recommendation which we review de novo.

II. STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
Michel is a native and citizen of Haiti who entered the United States on September 11, 1971, as a lawful permanent resident. In October, 1997, INS issued an order to show cause alleging that Michel had been convicted twice in 1994 of criminal possession of stolen property, and was therefore removable under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii). An immigration judge found Michel removable, a decision upheld by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) on October 27, 1998. However, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued a stay of removal during the pendency of an appeal to that court. The Second Circuit has since affirmed the final order of removal and lifted the stay. Michel v. I.N.S., 206 F.3d 253 (2d Cir.2000). See also 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(c)(6). The removal is based on Michel's two convictions for crimes of moral turpitude.
While the appeal was pending, Michel requested release on a $15,000.00 bond. The District Director in New York denied the request and notified Michel that he had the right to appeal to the BIA. No appeal from the denial was filed.
Originally, Michel was released on bail by an immigration officer. However, the immigration judge revoked bail, stating that Michel was ineligible. Michel has remained in custody while INS attempts to effect his deportation to Haiti. Although Haiti accepts deportees from the United States, the process is slow.
Given the above recitation, the issues before this court are limited. Michel is not one of those aliens subject to removal whose native country will not accept him, so that he is not likely to be subject to permanent detention. Also, there is no question regarding deportability, as any such question is answered by the Second Circuit's affirmance of the order of removal. Further, Michel may not petition for a waiver of deportation because he previously has received such a waiver. 206 F.3d at 257. The sole question is whether a resident alien who is subject to removal for committing crimes of moral turpitude has the right to be released on bond because his native country moves slowly to accept him. As recited by the magistrate judge, Michel has stated the issue as whether the failure to release him from custody on bond after the expiration of the 90-day *487 removal period violated his right to due process. Report and Recommendation at 3 (quoting Petitioner's Amended Reply to Respondent's Brief at 1).

III. JURISDICTION
As a preliminary matter, we note that INS argued before the magistrate judge that the court lacked jurisdiction over the denial of bond pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1226(e). The undersigned judge so held in Jacques v. Reno, 73 F.Supp.2d 477 (M.D.Pa.1999). In Chi Thon Ngo v. I.N.S., 192 F.3d 390 (3d Cir.1999), our Court of Appeals held, though without analysis, that the district court had jurisdiction over a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under § 2241. Id. at 393 (citing Sandoval v. Reno, 166 F.3d 225, 237-238 (3d Cir.1999); DeSousa v. Reno, 190 F.3d 175, 182 (3d Cir.1999)).
The petitioner in Chi Thon Ngo was an excludable alien who was subjected to exclusion proceedings for lack of a valid immigrant visa and for conviction of crimes of moral turpitude and aggravated felonies. Id. at 392. He claimed to be eligible for release because his country of origin would not accept him. Id. at 393. The statutory provision on which we relied in Jacques, § 1226(e), also would apply to proceedings involving a petitioner like that in Chi Thon Ngo. It follows, then, that the Third Circuit necessarily has abrogated Jacques to the extent we found that our jurisdiction to entertain a petition for a writ of habeas corpus had been repealed by § 1226(e).[1]
We turn, then, to the merits of the petition.

IV. RELEASE ON BOND
As noted, Michel claims to be entitled to release on bond or under an order of supervision because the 90-day period for removal has expired. The claim is asserted as arising under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
Once an alien is ordered "removed," INS[2] is afforded a 90-day period in which to effect removal. 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(1)(A). The alien is subject to detention during the removal period. Sec. 1231(a)(2). After expiration of the 90-day period, the alien may be released under specified conditions. § 1231(a)(3). While aliens such as Michel who are deportable under § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) must be detained pending a final order of removal, 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c)(1)(B), inadmissible aliens, aliens removable under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C), (a)(2), or (a)(4), and aliens determined to be a risk to the community or unlikely to comply with the removal order may be detained after expiration of the 90-day period. § 1231(a)(6). See also 8 C.F.R. §§ 241.1 et seq. (regulations governing post-hearing detention and removal, including continued detention and conditions of release).
Michel argues, however, that this statutory language violates his right to substantive due process because it requires that he be kept in prolonged detention, i.e. deprives him of his fundamental right to liberty, without an adequate governmental interest justifying the intrusion. The basic *488 disagreement between the parties is the extent to which Michel's asserted liberty interest is cognizable under the substantive component of the Due Process Clause.
This disagreement also is reflected in opinions by judges of this court on which the parties rely. In Sombat Map Kay v. Reno, 94 F.Supp.2d 546 (M.D.Pa.2000), Judge Rambo found that a deportable alien whose country of origin would not accept him was entitled to release on conditions. Judge Caldwell disagreed, finding that periodic review of an alien's continued detention satisfied the Due Process Clause. Cuesta Martinez v. I.N.S., 97 F.Supp.2d 647 (M.D.Pa.2000). We begin with some of the case law leading to those decisions, as well as opinions issued thereafter which put the decisions into context.

(A) Other Authority
In Chi Thon Ngo, the petitioner was a native of Viet Nam who was paroled into the United States in 1982. He was convicted in state court for firearm possession and for attempted robbery in unrelated events. He was ordered to be deported in 1995 because he lacked a valid visa, he committed a crime involving moral turpitude, and he committed two crimes for which the sentences imposed were greater than five years. Important in the analysis was the fact that the petitioner was paroled into the country, meaning that he had not been admitted formally and was considered to have the status of an applicant for admission, despite his lengthy residence in the United States. Id. at 392 and n. 1.
The petitioner claimed that Viet Nam's refusal to take him back meant that he was subject to virtually indefinite detention. Id. at 392-393. The Third Circuit first reviewed the applicable provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, both before and after amendment through the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009. Because both versions of the statutes granted INS the authority to detain or release on conditions, there was no need to determine which version applied. Id. at 394-395.
There are conflicting constitutional and policy considerations at issue in that Congress has attempted to insulate the national community from potentially dangerous criminal aliens, and aliens released from custody have a great potential to abscond, but those aliens have due process rights. Id. at 395. The problem was to find a way of satisfying these conflicting interests.
The Third Circuit first noted that the exclusion of aliens is a matter generally for the political branches and that, in many instances, the exercise of the power over naturalization and immigration would be unacceptable if applied to citizens. Id. at 395-396. Still, an alien is a "person" entitled to substantive due process protection and, in some circumstances, procedural due process. Id. at 396. The Third Circuit then reviewed a number of cases involving the detention of excludable aliens in which courts found no substantive due process violation. The one exception was a case decided before INS promulgated regulations relating to periodic parole review for Mariel Cubans. Also, one case involved a deportable alien whose continuing detention was upheld, subject to the same regulations. Id. at 396-397. The Third Circuit summarized these holdings as follows:
... [T]here is no constitutional impediment to the indefinite detention of an alien with a criminal record under a final order of exclusion, deportation, or removal if (1) there is a possibility of his eventual departure; (2) there are adequate and reasonable provisions for the grant of parole; and (3) detention is necessary to prevent a risk of flight or a threat to the community.
Id. at 397.
Therefore, while recognizing that the "entry fiction" is precisely that, a fiction, *489 and that detention indeed is tantamount to punishment, the Third Circuit concluded that continued detention for lengthy periods was permissible as long as adequate provisions for parole are available. Id. at 397-398. Its holding was limited to excludable aliens, with no views expressed on the applicability of the same principles in cases involving deportable aliens. Id. at 398 n. 7. Because the regulations governing parole review for the Mariel Cubans satisfied the Due Process Clause if applied properly, and negotiations were underway with Viet Nam (so that detention could not be said to be permanent), INS was given 30 days to conduct the necessary parole review or the petitioner would be released. Id. at 398-399.
For present purposes, the upshot of Chi Thon Ngo is that, at least as applies to excludable aliens, prolonged detention does not violate due process as long as the type of review described therein is provided. The question becomes whether the same principle will apply to deportable aliens.
One of the cases cited by Judge Rambo in Sombat Map Kay is Binh Phan v. Reno, 56 F.Supp.2d 1149 (W.D.Wash.1999) (en banc).[3] In that case, the five judges of the Western District of Washington sat en banc to review five "lead cases" so that they would have a common framework for analyzing due process claims in a large number of immigration cases then pending. Id. at 1151. In an opinion by Chief Judge Coughenour, the court first reviewed the statutory and regulatory framework, determined that it had jurisdiction under § 2241, and rejected a government argument that administrative exhaustion was required before the court should entertain the claims. Id. at 1151-1153. It then turned to the petitioners' due process arguments.
Initially, the court noted that all aliens have liberty interests under the Fifth Amendment, but that excludable aliens are limited in that interest to the procedure explicitly authorized by Congress due to the entry fiction. Id. at 1153-1154. However, because lawfully admitted aliens develop ties that go with permanent residence, their constitutional status changes, and they are entitled to greater protection under the Due Process Clause. Id. at 1154. See also id. at 1154 n. 6 (referring to the foregoing principle as the "assimilation doctrine").
Having noted that the first question in substantive due process analysis is a careful description of the asserted right, the court rejected the government's description of the right as the right to be released into the United States pending removal. Rather, the right is the fundamental interest in liberty generally. Id. at 1154. Because the described right is fundamental, the questioned government action is subject to "strict scrutiny," meaning that "a deprivation will comport with due process only if it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest." Id. at 1154-1155 (citation omitted).
Applying this standard, the court looked at the asserted government goals in detaining deportable criminal aliens and whether the detention is excessive in light of those goals. It also examined the goals in the context of the government's (or at least the political branches') usual plenary authority over immigration matters. It rejected a more deferential standard because *490 there was no need to extend such deference beyond the deportation order, as the governmental interests asserted (prevention of flight and protection of the public) are domestic, and not foreign policy, matters. Id. at 1155. The court concluded that, balanced against the likelihood that the government would effectuate removal and the dangerousness of the individual alien, the detention of an alien did not comport with substantive due process when there is no realistic chance that the alien will be removed. Id. at 1155-1156.
Diametrically opposed to Binh Phan is Zadvydas v. Underdown, 185 F.3d 279 (5th Cir.1999), reh'g en banc denied, cert. granted, ___ U.S. ____, 121 S.Ct. 297, ___ L.Ed.2d ____ (2000). The petitioner in that case had a complicated history relating to his country of origin because his parents were "displaced persons" in Germany in the aftermath of World War II. Both parents were from historically disputed territory which, at various times, was independent Lithuania, territory of Nazi Germany, or part of the Soviet empire. In addition, Germany requires birth of German blood for citizenship, as opposed to birth on its territory (as would apply in the United States). The complications arising from this parentage prevented easy resolution of the problem of finding a country willing to accept the petitioner after removal from the United States. In addition, the Dominican Republic, the country of origin of the petitioner's wife, did not respond to inquiry from INS. Regardless, the petitioner had been admitted lawfully to the United States but had committed offenses which left him subject to a final order of deportation. He was detained by INS as a flight risk. Id. at 283-284.
The Fifth Circuit also reviewed the statutory and regulatory context of the petition and found jurisdiction. Id. at 285-288. It then reviewed precedent concerning the sovereign's power to control immigration matters, describing this power as "essentially plenary." Id. at 288-289. While aliens have rights as "persons" for purposes of the Fifth Amendment, those rights are limited by the sovereign's plenary powers. Thus, while an illegal alien cannot be sentenced to hard labor without due process, id. at 289 (citing Wong Wing v. United States, 163 U.S. 228, 16 S.Ct. 977, 41 L.Ed. 140 (1896)), the constitutional rights of aliens may be restricted when they conflict with the sovereign's plenary power. Id. (citing, inter alia, Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753, 92 S.Ct. 2576, 33 L.Ed.2d 683 (1972) (citizens had First Amendment interest in listening to communist agitator, but government could exclude agitator; by implication, agitator's interest in speech did not outweigh plenary power)).
The Fifth Circuit then distinguished Wong Wing, in which the alien was summarily punished to a year at hard labor and thereafter to removal from the United States. The Supreme Court itself noted in that opinion that detention pending deportation is not the same as detention as punishment for being illegally present in this country because the former is necessary to the deportation proceedings. Zadvydas at 289 (quoting Wong Wing at 980; removal proceedings "would be in vain" if the alien could not be detained).
The Fifth Circuit then restated the principle that excludable aliens could be detained for an indefinite period of time pending removal, citing its prior holding in a case involving Mariel Cubans. Id. at 290 (citing Gisbert v. U.S. Attorney General, 988 F.2d 1437 (5th Cir.1993)). It rejected the petitioner's argument that, as a deportable alien, he had greater substantive rights than an excludable alien. The difference in rights applies to the procedural protections applicable to the decision to deport, as compared to the decision to exclude, and does not affect substantive rights once there has been a decision to deport or exclude. Id.
Next, the court engaged in an analysis of whether the petitioner's detention in fact could be considered permanent, and *491 determined that it could not, at least not until potential avenues for finding a country which would accept him were exhausted. Id. at 291-294. It then returned to the question of a deportable alien's substantive rights.
With respect to excludable aliens, when they seek to enter this country, they are requesting a privilege rather than asserting a right. Exclusion therefore is not a deprivation of rights but a denial of a privilege, which, in combination with the deference due in immigration matters, means that the decision is not subject to procedural limitations. Moreover, most substantive rights are constrained by the government's need to control immigration. Id. at 294. To the extent that substantive rights are infringed in a manner unconnected to the immigration power, an excludable alien may assert such rights. This would include the right to be free from malicious infliction of cruel treatment. Id. at 295.
In contrast, resident aliens are entitled to procedural due process prior to removal. This right arises from their continued presence in the country and the ties that naturally arise therefrom. Still, the plenary power is not extinguished, and the fact that the standard for evaluating the procedures used is lower than would be applied in the case of a citizen demonstrates the continued viability of the plenary power. Id. (also collecting cases). Nothing in the case law reviewed, however, indicated that a deportable alien has greater substantive rights than excludable aliens when the right asserted and the government interest asserted are the same. Id.
In the circumstances presented here, the national interest in effectuating deportation is identical regardless of whether the alien was once resident or excludable. When a former resident alien iswith the adequate and unchallenged procedural due process to which his assertion of a right to remain in this country entitles himfinally ordered deported, the decision has irrevocably been made to expel him from the national community. Nothing remains but to effectuate this decision. The need to expel such an alien is identical, from a national sovereignty perspective, to the need to remove an excludable alien who has been finally and properly ordered returned to his country of origin.... Whether the party to be deported is an excludable or a former resident, the United States has properly made its decision and earnestly wishesif for no other reason than to save the cost of detentionto deport the detainee. And deportation itself is not punishment....
Id. at 296 (citations omitted).
The Fifth Circuit continued by pointing out that the fact that deportation cannot be effected immediately is not a ground for distinguishing between deportable and excludable aliens. In both instances, the government's interest is in preventing crimes against the populace and preventing flight which would defeat the deportation decision. The court emphasized that society must tolerate levels of recidivism from citizens but need not be so generous to non-citizens. Also, the legitimacy of the government's concern about flight is reflected in the fact that the event has occurred with some frequency. Id. at 296-297. To the extent that a resident alien has an interest greater than that of an excludable alien, that interest is in the procedural protections honored in making the deportation decision, and that difference disappears once the final decision is made. Id. at 297.
For these reasons, the Fifth Circuit concluded that INS could detain deportable aliens subject to the same limitations (good faith efforts to effect deportation, along with reasonable parole and periodic review procedures) as apply to the detention of excludable aliens subject to prolonged detention. Id. The court specifically rejected the conclusions reached by the Western District of Washington. Id. at 297 n. 20.
*492 Even more recently, the Tenth Circuit addressed the same issues in Duy Dac Ho v. Greene, 204 F.3d 1045 (10th Cir.2000). The petitioners (two cases were consolidated on appeal) were both natives and citizens of Viet Nam who entered the United States lawfully but were subjected to final orders of removal for having committed aggravated felonies. Id. at 1048. The district court granted petitions under § 2241 after reading the governing statutes as not authorizing continued detention and concluding that continued detention violated the petitioners' substantive due process rights. Id. at 1049-150. For reasons not relevant to this discussion, the Tenth Circuit concluded that it had jurisdiction and that the statutes permitted indefinite detention. Id. at 1050-1057. In addressing the substantive due process argument, the court first noted that it was not bound by a prior opinion in which the constitutional analysis was viewed properly as dicta. Id. at 1057.
The court next characterized the asserted right not as a general right to be free of incarceration without a criminal trial, but as a right to be at large in the United States, the very right denied them by the final orders of removal. The rationale was that their petition in effect was a request to be readmitted to the United States. Id. at 1058. Although aliens present in the United States are persons for purposes of the Fifth Amendment, the petitioners' heightened constitutional status was stripped by the final orders of deportation and they stood as applicants for admission, with no greater expectations than first-time applicants. Id. at 1058-1059.
Addressing the argument of one petitioner who claimed greater rights as a former lawful resident alien, the Tenth Circuit relied on Zadvydas and found no distinction between former resident aliens and excludable aliens. Id. at 1059. It therefore concluded that the petitioners had no due process right, substantive or procedural, of which they were deprived through the denial of "their application for entry," and the district court's judgment was reversed. Id. at 1060.
One judge dissented in Duy Dac Ho, essentially for the reasons recited in Binh Phan. Duy Dac Ho at 1060-1063.
The final case to be taken into consideration is Kim Ho Ma v. Reno, 208 F.3d 815 (9th Cir.2000). In that case (an appeal of one of the five lead cases in Binh Phan), the Ninth Circuit concluded that the Immigration and Nationalization Act does not confer authority on INS to detain indefinitely any alien subject to removal whose country of origin will not permit repatriation. We believe that § 1231(a)(6) plainly allows detention where it states that specified aliens "may be detained beyond the removal period..." Moreover, in Chi Thon Ngo (at 394-395), the Third Circuit held that § 1231(a) authorizes indefinite detention of excludable aliens, and the same provision applies to deportable aliens. It follows that the Third Circuit's statutory analysis directly contradicts Kim Ho Ma and the principles discussed therein cannot be said to be the law of this circuit. We therefore address Kim Ho Ma no further.
It also should be noted that the Supreme Court has granted petitions for certiorari in Zadvydas and Kim Ho Ma, and has consolidated the cases. Zadvydas v. Underdown, ___ U.S. ____, 121 S.Ct. 297, ____ L.Ed.2d ____ (2000). While further guidance on the issue before us therefore appears forthcoming, we do not defer disposition of the pending matter because we resolve it in favor of INS. That is, we conclude that Michel is subject to continued detention with periodic review. In effect, the status quo is maintained thereby, a result which would not differ if we awaited the Supreme Court's disposition of Zadvydas. We therefore do not do so.

(B) Opinions of Other Middle District Judges
As noted, in Sombat Map Kay, Judge Rambo concluded that the detention of a deportable alien whose country of origin *493 would not accept him violated his right to substantive due process. Her reasoning essentially parallels that of Binh Phan. She began with a review of the relevant statutes and regulations, as well as general substantive due process principles. Sombat Map Kay at 548-549. She then rejected INS's position that the right at issue was release into the national community, deciding instead that the asserted right was to be free from restraint behind bars. Id. at 549. Because the fundamental right to liberty was at issue, strict scrutiny applies. Id. at 549-550.
Examining the interests at issue, Judge Rambo agreed that the government asserted three legitimate regulatory purposes: executing the petitioner's removal, preventing flight before removal, and preventing danger to the community. The latter two derived solely from the first, but still could be considered compelling. Id. at 550. She also recognized the sovereign authority to control the borders through immigration laws, but found the principle inapposite. That is, the petitioner sought to be released from detention pending removal and could not be considered "at the border" in the sense in which the entry fiction normally applies. Id. at 550-551. Also, the plenary power applies to exclusion and deportation of aliens, not to their detention, so that "the government's interests are not at their maximum level, and the government's power is not plenary." Id. at 551 (also citing Binh Phan for the principle that the interests at stake are domestic, not international, matters).
While recognizing that the petitioner's conviction was for a serious offense, and that he had admitted other serious acts, Judge Rambo noted that, when the likelihood of deportation is low or nonexistent, the government's primary purpose in detention "is nonsensical, and the other derivative purposes cannot support indefinite detention." Id. She then pointed out that length of detention is an important factor in strict scrutiny analysis. Id. at 551-552. At some point, the length of detention exceeds any regulatory need and becomes merely punitive in nature. Id. at 552. Judge Rambo then concluded the strict scrutiny analysis by pointing out that the petitioner had not committed any acts subjecting him to discipline while detained and had completed several programs. His family had indicated it would provide him with a home and other assistance if released. It appeared, then, that the risk of flight or dangerousness was low, and he had been detained for some two years with little chance of repatriation at any time in the foreseeable future. Judge Rambo therefore concluded that the prolonged detention was excessive. Id. at 552-553.
Turning to INS's argument that Chi Thon Ngo was binding, Judge Rambo distinguished the case as limited to excludable aliens, as specified therein. Sombat Map Kay at 553 and n. 9 (citing Chi Thon Ngo at 398 n. 7). She then reviewed authority supporting the proposition that aliens who have been admitted to the country have greater constitutional status than excludable aliens. Once again, that status is premised on the "entry fiction," which has no applicability beyond the stage at which a determination is made concerning admission. Id. at 553-554. Judge Rambo then rejected the holdings of Duy Dac Ho and Zadvydas as essentially expanding the entry fiction to deportable aliens. Also, the court in Zadvydas did not identify the level of analysis (strict scrutiny, rational basis, or some intermediate level) which it was applying. Sombat Map Kay at 554-556.
Finally, Judge Rambo found it inappropriate to expand the entry fiction beyond the context for which it was created, i.e. permitting detention of aliens physically present in the country pending a determination of admissibility. Rather, language employed by the Third Circuit in Chi Thon Ngo supported her reasoning by taking length of detention into consideration. Sombat Map Kay at 556-557. She therefore granted the writ of habeas corpus, directing INS to release the petitioner *494 subject to conditions, absent a showing within 90 days that removal was likely in the foreseeable future. Id. at 557.
In Cuesta Martinez, Judge Caldwell disagreed with Judge Rambo and followed Zadvydas. After a discussion of the applicable terminology, he turned to INS's contention that Chi Thon Ngo applied, despite the stated limitation on its holding. Judge Caldwell first noted that the petitioner's position was based on Binh Phan and then noted Judge Rambo's reliance thereon, continuing with a summary of the holding in Sombat Map Kay. Cuesta Martinez at 649-650. He also pointed out the contrary holdings in Zadvydas and Duy Dac Ho, and several district court opinions which followed Binh Phan. Cuesta Martinez at 650.
Judge Caldwell emphasized that aspect of the reasoning in Zadvydas equating the status of both excludable aliens and aliens subject to a final order of deportation. Of importance is the fact that neither has any further right to remain in the United States, as all that remains is to effectuate repatriation. The interest from a national sovereignty perspective is identical. Cuesta Martinez at 650-651 (quoting Zadvydas at 296). In contrast, the principles underlying Binh Phan are derived from Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 103 S.Ct. 321, 74 L.Ed.2d 21 (1982), which established the assimilation doctrine discussed above. That doctrine, however, is inapplicable once a final order of removal issues because it applies to the procedural protection afforded a deportable alien, and the alien's ties to this country are severed by the final order. Cuesta Martinez at 651.
Judge Caldwell then distinguished another case cited in Sombat Map Kay, Leng May Ma v. Barber, 357 U.S. 185, 78 S.Ct. 1072, 2 L.Ed.2d 1246 (1958). That case dealt with an alien paroled into the country who sought discretionary withholding of deportation based on persecution in her home country. The Supreme Court held that the parole did not allow her to assert that right, which was available to deportable aliens. The opinion simply has nothing to say about the rights of deportable aliens whose right to remain has been terminated. Cuesta Martinez at 652.
The next issue addressed was the purported failure of the court in Zadvydas to recognize that the law acknowledges an "acquired constitutional status" based on the fact of admission. Cuesta Martinez at 652 (quoting Thien Van Vo v. Greene, 63 F.Supp.2d 1278, 1283 (D.Colo.1999)). Judge Caldwell pointed out that the entry fiction ultimately derives from statutory, not constitutional, authority. The purpose is to determine what immigration proceeding is available to the alien based on his status as deportable or excludable, while constitutional analysis seeks to determine what liberty interest may be asserted. The interest (freedom from confinement) would be the same regardless of the alien's status as deportable or excludable. Judge Caldwell therefore agreed with the analysis of Zadvydas and concluded that the Chi Thon Ngo approach would be appropriate for analyzing the claim before him. Cuesta Martinez at 652.
Examining the parole reviews provided to the petitioner, Judge Caldwell concluded that INS was in substantial compliance with the procedure prescribed by the Third Circuit. To the extent it was not, there were good reasons (INS was awaiting a psychological report before providing written notification). The writ of habeas corpus was denied without prejudice to the petitioner's right to bring a future action based on future events. Id. at 652-653.

(C) Our Determination
Having reviewed these cases, we conclude that Judge Caldwell and the Fifth Circuit have the better of the argument. Rather than merely state as much or reiterate the holdings of the cases consistent with this view, we set forth our reasons for disagreeing with Judge Rambo and the Western District of Washington in some detail.
*495 Initially, we have some difficulty with the manner in which Judge Rambo reached her ultimate conclusion which is unrelated to the deportable/excludable distinction. After determining that the petitioner's right to be free from confinement outweighed the government's interest in effecting removal, as well as concluding that the derivative interests in public safety and flight risk failed as a matter of law once the interest in effecting removal was outweighed, Judge Rambo proceeded to examine the individual petitioner's dangerousness and flight risk. Sombat Map Kay at 552. However, once there was a determination that INS cannot detain a deportable alien if removal is not likely, the only questions are whether removal is likely and whether INS in fact is detaining the alien. The reasons for detention already had been found constitutionally inadequate, and any further balancing would be of no consequence. See Cuesta Martinez at 650 ("In these circumstances, the alien's liberty interest in being free from incarceration outweighs as a matter of law the government's interest in detention, even if there is evidence that the alien is a risk to the community, or possibly a flight risk."; citing Sombat Map Kay).
Apart from that problem, however, we disagree with the view expressed in Binh Phan and its progeny that the right at issue is the freedom from incarceration. The fact of the matter is that, because no other country will accept the alien, the only place to which the alien may be released is the United States. However, as a result of the final order of removal, there is no right to be at large in the United States. In fact, there is no general right for non-citizens to be at large within the United States, and even the right of citizens to be at large is subject to limitations. See generally Zadvydas at 297 n. 19 (examples of citizens detained for protection of the public). As stated above, an alien's entry into the United States (and therefore the state of being at large within our national community) is a privilege, not a right.
Stated differently, to say that there is a right to freedom from incarceration necessarily implies a right to the opposite, i.e. that there is a right to be at large in the community. Since the necessary obverse does not exist for aliens, it is improper and an oversimplification to characterize the right as simply the freedom from incarceration.
Rather than finding that failing to distinguish between excludable and deportable aliens after a final order of removal improperly expands the entry fiction, we believe that making this distinction improperly expands the assimilation doctrine. The cases granting heightened constitutional status to aliens once admitted to the United States all refer to the process that is due before a final order of removal may issue. The idea is that an alien who has lived in this country for an extended period of time will have established ties through employment, family, friends, etc., which should not be taken away lightly. INS therefore is required to evaluate the case more carefully and with greater procedural protections than would apply to an alien subject to exclusion, who presumably would not have the ties to the community to the extent a resident alien would have.
However, once the order of removal becomes final, the resident alien no longer has a right to participation in our society and the ties which may have been established are no longer a significant consideration. Giving the former resident alien greater substantive rights expands the assimilation doctrine to cases to which it has not applied previously and into a context for which it was not intended.
That the assimilation doctrine is not subject to expansion is reflected in Chi Thon Ngo, in which the petitioner had been paroled into the United States in 1982. Presumably, such a person would establish the same sorts of community ties as a person formally admitted, yet he still was considered excludable for purposes of the applicable *496 proceedings, and did not have any heightened constitutional status for purposes of release pending removal.
Conversely, we do not see how failing to distinguish between deportable and excludable aliens in this context is necessarily an expansion of the entry fiction at all. Rather, it is an equation of the liberty interest on the part of the two "classes" of aliens. That is, neither has a right to be in the United States and is subject to repatriation at the earliest possible opportunity. The only difference in their circumstances was that the deportable alien was once a resident, and the interest to which that residence gave rise has been honored through greater procedural protections prior to the removal order. Once honored, the interest is extinguished for purposes of any further constitutional analysis, and the difference in circumstances no longer exists. The two are identical for purposes of any further due process analysis. This holding is not an expansion of the entry fiction; it is a limitation on the assimilation doctrine, which (as Judge Caldwell pointed out) had no constitutional basis to begin with, but ultimately derived from immigration law.
Another way of viewing this matter is to compare the asserted right to the right to personal liberty enjoyed by citizens. Reduced to its basic form, the holding of the cases finding a deportable/excludable alien distinction for substantive due process purposes is that a deportable alien subject to a final order of removal may not be detained by INS if there is no chance that removal will be effected in the foreseeable future. That is, the alien has an absolute right to parole under these conditions, despite having been afforded all necessary procedural protections before a final determination was made to deport the alien. A citizen charged with a serious criminal offense, however, may be held without bail pending trial despite not having been afforded all of the necessary procedural protections before a final determination of guilt may be made. This conclusion flies in the face of logic.
Another way to view this matter is to take an example, albeit an extreme example. Suppose that a resident alien was arrested for an attempt to murder a prostitute, an offense which would render him deportable. While INS has custody, it is discovered that the alien is Jack the Ripper. Great Britain, after determining that its interest in pursuing criminal prosecution is outweighed by the danger of having such a person within its borders, might well decline extradition or repatriation. The logic of Binh Phan and its progeny would lead to a determination that the Ripper has an absolute right to be at large within our borders once his criminal sentence expires, a plainly unacceptable result.
While our example tends to the extreme, we use it only to point out there are people, such as aliens subject to a final order of removal, who have no right to be at large in the United States and as to whom the governmental interest in protecting the public outweighs any right against prolonged detention. Viewed from this perspective, the governmental interest cannot be seen as derivative of the interest in effecting the removal. Rather, it is an independent and important interest; actually, one of the (if not the single) most important of governmental interests.
In this context, we note our disagreement with Binh Phan and its progeny that the matter is entirely domestic. While a foreign nation's refusal to accept return of its nationals may be said to diminish the international or foreign relations aspect of the matter, the fact remains that the person in detention is an alien, not a citizen, and is subject to removal as soon as possible and with no right to be in the United States. The matter remains one of immigration law and not domestic law, and the plenary power remains in effect.
We also disagree with the characterization of detention pending removal as necessarily punitive. In Chi Thon Ngo, the *497 Third Circuit noted that characterizing prolonged detention as anything but punishment would be "puzzling to petitioner, who remained in jail under the same conditions as before the state released him, although his status had technically changed from that of a state inmate to an INS `detainee.'" Id. at 397-398. Referring to the legal fiction that the detained alien is "free," the court added, "It is similarly unrealistic to believe that these INS detainees are not actually being `punished' in some sense for their past conduct." Id. at 398. See also Sombat Map Kay at 550 n. 7 (quoting the latter statement).
The problem with relying on this quotation for a finding that detained aliens are being punished is that the "some sense" does not refer to the constitutional sense, or at least in a sense that the Constitution is being violated. That is, it is only when detention no longer satisfies a rational, non-punitive purpose that the detention becomes unconstitutional punishment. Zadvydas at 297 and n. 19.
For all of these reasons, we agree with Judge Caldwell, the Fifth Circuit, and the Tenth Circuit that there is no reason to distinguish between deportable and excludable aliens for purposes of detention pending removal. The reasoning of Chi Thon Ngo therefore applies in cases involving deportable aliens subject to a final order of removal. Such aliens may be detained by INS subject to periodic review for parole, including a thorough review of the alien's risk of flight and/or danger to the community.

(D) Other Due Process Argument
In addition to the deportable/excludable distinction discussed above, Michel argues that an analysis of the sufficiency of the parole review procedure has not been made. Actually, a more thorough argument would be that the procedures fail such a test. Regardless, the Third Circuit undertook such an analysis in Chi Thon Ngo, which is binding on us. The analysis suggested by Michel would be superfluous.
Because of the conclusion we reach, we do not examine the effect of the fact that Haiti is simply slow to accept deportees, as opposed to nations which do not accept deportees. That is, Michel's situation is one of a slower process than normal, but there is no basis for a conclusion that removal will not be effected or is highly unlikely to be effected. Since INS is providing periodic review under these circumstances, the distinction is not material.

V. REMOVAL PERIOD
Michel adds an argument that the magistrate judge misapplied the removal period provision. The statute provides in part:
Except as otherwise provided in this section, when an alien is ordered removed, the Attorney General shall remove the alien from the United States within a period of 90 days (in this section referred to as the "removal period").
.   .   .   .   .
The removal period begins on the latest of the following:
(i) The date the order of removal becomes administratively final.
(ii) If the removal order is judicially reviewed and if a court orders a stay of the removal of the alien, the date of the court's final order.
(iii) If the alien is detained or confined (except under an immigration process), the date the alien is released from detention or confinement.
8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(1)(A), (B).
In reciting the procedural history of the case, the magistrate judge indicated that the BIA dismissed Michel's appeal on October 27, 1998, rendering the removal order administratively final and establishing January 25, 1999, as the end of the 90-day removal period. However, the Second Circuit issued a stay on February 9, 1999, and vacated the stay when it affirmed the BIA on February 4, 2000. Report and Recommendation at 2. According to Michel, the *498 magistrate judge's later conclusion that he had only recently fallen within the release provisions of § 1231 is incorrect.
This argument is based on a premise that there can be only one removal period, and that the magistrate judge was incorrect in reading the statute to allow the removal period to restart after the stay was vacated. Actually, that is the only rational reading of the statute.
According to Michel's reading, once the removal order became final and the removal period began, that was the only period of time which could be designated as the removal period. However, the statute provides that the removal period begins on the latest of several dates. The passing of one date does not stop the operation of the statute.
In a sense, the only way to apply the statute to a given situation is retrospectively. That is, the removal period begins when the removal order becomes final. If a court issues a stay, the removal period begins when the stay is lifted. Therefore, the only way to determine when the removal period begins, or began, is to look at what events already have occurred. If there is another potential event, there is another potential beginning date for the removal period. The only sensible reading of this provision is that INS is required to effectuate the removal within 90 days of certain events, but will have another 90 days if another one of the designated events occurs at a later date. The obvious reason for this is that INS's authority to effect the removal is suspended due to the occurrence of the later event (such as a stay order).
In Michel's case, the magistrate judge correctly determined that the removal period began on February 4, 2000, so that the instant petition is premature.

VI. CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, we conclude that a deportable alien subject to a final order of removal may be detained by INS beyond the 90-day removal period. An alien subject to such detention is entitled to periodic review for purposes of release on conditions as described in Chi Thon Ngo. The time for such review begins on the date that the order becomes administratively final, the date on which any stay ordered by a court is vacated, or the date on which the alien is released from detention or confinement for other than immigration process. The beginning date of the 90-day removal period is not altered by the fact that one of these events may have occurred at an earlier time.
An order consistent with this memorandum will issue.

ORDER
For the reasons stated in the accompanying memorandum, IT IS ORDERED THAT:
1. The report and recommendation (record document no. 18) of the magistrate judge is adopted as the holding of the court, as supplemented hereby.
2. Petitioner Jean Patrick Michel's exceptions (record document no. 19) to the report and recommendation are construed as objections to the report and recommendation under LR 72.3 of the Local Rules for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, and are overruled.
3. Michel's petition (record document no. 1) for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 is denied.
4. The clerk is directed to close the file.
NOTES
[1]  We noted in Jacques that our analysis might be in conflict with that applied in cases decided by the Third Circuit, which in turn we felt were in conflict with Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, 525 U.S. 471, 119 S.Ct. 936, 142 L.Ed.2d 940 (1999). However, the Third Circuit precedent was distinguishable, and we therefore were able to resolve Jacques so as to avoid any conflict with Third Circuit decisions. Jacques at 481-482. In DeSousa, the Third Circuit read American-Arab far more narrowly than we did in Jacques. We do not believe that we have any further authority to read American-Arab as we see fit, but must do so in light of DeSousa. See also Liang v. I.N.S., 206 F.3d 308 (3d Cir.2000).
[2]  Although the governing statutes refer to the authority and duties of the Attorney General, responsibility for immigration matters has been delegated to INS, and so we refer to INS for present purposes. Also, we refer to the codified version of the statutes for ease of reference and reading.
[3]  In Kim Ho Ma v. Reno, 208 F.3d 815 (9th Cir.2000), the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit conducted a statutory analysis and determined that INS lacks authority to detain an alien beyond the 90-day removal period if the alien cannot be returned to his or her native land due to the absence of a repatriation agreement. Ma was one of the cases consolidated for en banc review in Binh Phan, and has been consolidated with Zadvydas v. Underdown (discussed later in this opinion) for review by the Supreme Court on certiorari. For present purposes, then, Binh Phan has been abrogated and Ma represents the law of the Ninth Circuit. The reasoning of Binh Phan, however, has been adopted by a number of district courts and it remains an important opinion. See Cuesta Martinez at 650 (collecting cases). It is for this reason that we undertake our examination of Binh Phan.

United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit.
April 10, 1989.

Before BOYCE F. MARTIN, Jr. and MILBURN, Circuit Judges, and JOHN D. HOLSCHUH, District Judge*.
PER CURIAM.


1
The Secretary of Health and Human Services ("Secretary") found that claimant Gloria Cooley ("Cooley") became disabled on May 23, 1984.  Cooley appeals the Secretary's determination of her onset date, arguing she is entitled to an earlier date.  For the reasons that follow, we affirm the finding of disability, but reverse the district court's determination of Cooley's onset date.

I.

2
Cooley applied for disability insurance benefits on March 25, 1982.  Her application was denied initially and upon reconsideration.  She requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge ("ALJ"), which was held on September 10, 1984.  On November 15, 1984, the ALJ issued an opinion finding Cooley not disabled.  This became the final decision of the Secretary.  Cooley then filed for judicial review in the district court.


3
On November 6, 1985, the district court remanded the case to the Secretary for a new evaluation under the revised mental impairment standards of the Social Security Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984 (Pub.L. No. 98-460).  The ALJ conducted two more hearings, on May 19 and July 22, 1986.  On January 8, 1987, the ALJ found Cooley disabled by an anxiety-related disorder pursuant to 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt.  P, App. 1, Sec. 12.06, with an onset date of May 23, 1984.  He characterized Cooley as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, aggravated by personality and anxiety problems.  He found that she was never capable of returning to her past relevant work after she was injured in April 1981, but she could do unskilled work between April 1981 and May 23, 1984.  The Appeals Council adopted the ALJ's recommendations.


4
Cooley continued to object to the 1984 onset date and reinstated her action for judicial review.  Both Cooley and the Secretary moved for summary judgment.  The matter was referred to the magistrate, who recommended granting Cooley's motion for summary judgment.  The magistrate believed the medical evidence established that Cooley's ability to concentrate became substantially impaired in April 1981.  Therefore, the hypothetical question relied upon by the ALJ which assumed she could concentrate did not accurately portray her impairment, and the vocational expert's response to the deficient question was not evidence that Cooley could perform unskilled work between April 1981 and May 1984.


5
The district court rejected the magistrate's recommendation and affirmed the Secretary's decision that Cooley became disabled on May 23, 1984.  The district court did not address the magistrate's concerns with the ALJ's hypothetical question.  Cooley then filed a timely appeal with this court.


6
Cooley was born April 5, 1946, and was thirty-five years old when she was injured on April 6, 1981, while working as a health instructor at M.L. King High School in Detroit.  According to the injury report she filed with the Board of Education, Cooley was monitoring a hallway when she heard a commotion in a girls' restroom.  She went into the restroom, found several boys and girls, and turned to find another teacher to help her with the situation.  The students rushed to leave, and Cooley's head and body were squeezed and smashed several times as she became trapped between a brick wall and a door that was repeatedly thrown open by fleeing students.  Cooley reported suffering bruises on her face and body.  Later, in August 1981, when she underwent the first of numerous physical and neurological examinations, she reported that she lost consciousness during the restroom incident.  Cooley's mental and emotional condition deteriorated significantly between April 1981 and May 1984.


7
Cooley testified that since the restroom incident she has been unable to think clearly, and has become forgetful to the point where she lives according to routines and lists.  She experiences speech, reading and vision difficulties;  becomes fatigued and overwhelmed frequently and easily;  and has remained severely depressed, withdrawn and is frightened by other people and her inability to think and speak clearly and coherently.  Cooley's complaints and symptoms are documented in an extensive medical history.


8
Between June 1981 and May 1983, Cooley was examined by several neurologists, ophthalmologists, psychiatrists and psychologists, dentists, an ear, nose and throat physician, and a speech therapist.  She was hospitalized from May 23, 1984, through June 20, 1984, because of the increasing severity of her impairments and her withdrawal from normal life activities.  At admission, she was anxious, easily overwhelmed, depressed and fearful.1

9
Our scope of review is limited to the inquiry of whether the Secretary's findings are supported by "substantial evidence."   Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389, 401 (1971).  Substantial evidence is "such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion."   Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938).  In reviewing for substantial evidence, we must examine the record taken as a whole.   Duncan v. Secretary of Health & Human Servs., 801 F.2d 847, 852 (6th Cir.1986).

Because the ALJ found that Cooley was never capable of returning to her past relevant work, the burden shifted to the Secretary to show by substantial evidence that she could perform work that existed in the national economy.   See Buress v. Secretary of Health & Human Servs., 835 F.2d 139, 142 (6th Cir.1987) (per curiam);  Varley v. Secretary of Health & Human Servs., 820 F.2d 777, 779 (6th Cir.1987).  The theoretical ability to engage in some type of work is not enough;  the Secretary must make "a finding supported by substantial evidence that [the claimant] has the vocational qualifications to perform specific jobs."   O'Banner v. Secretary of Health, Educ. & Welfare, 587 F.2d 321, 323 (6th Cir.1978).  "Substantial evidence may be produced through reliance on the testimony of a vocational expert in response to a 'hypothetical question,' but only 'if the question accurately portrays [the claimant's] individual physical and mental impairments.' "   Varley, 820 F.2d at 779 (quoting Podedworny v. Harris, 745 F.2d 210, 218 (3d Cir.1984)).

11
Cooley asserts the Secretary did not show by substantial evidence that she could perform specific jobs.  The pertinent part of the ALJ's opinion provides:


12
While the evidence of record does suggest the existence of a mental impairment going back to 1981, the undersigned finds that, given the minimal clinical findings in the record prior to May of 1984, the claimant's mental impairment, while severe, did not preclude her from performing a full range of unskilled work.  While the testimony from the vocational expert and the medical findings in the record indicate that the claimant could not have performed her teaching job at that time and that her mental impairment probably precluded her from using or transferring her vocational skills, there is nothing in the record indicating that the claimant's mental impairment would have impacted upon her ability to perform unskilled work prior to May of 1984.  The undersigned further finds that prior to May 1984, the claimant could have performed those unskilled ... jobs identified by the vocational expert, and that these jobs existed in significant numbers in the local economy.


13
J.A. at 232-33 (emphasis supplied).


14
Striking in the above passage is the ALJ's declaration that "there is nothing in this record indicating" that Cooley could not perform unskilled work prior to May 1984.  This statement reflects a mistaken view of the case.  As Buress and Varley make clear, the focus is not on what is absent from the record, but what evidence is in the record to prove that Cooley had the vocational qualifications to perform specific jobs.


15
The Secretary's proof of Cooley's residual functional capacity consisted of the testimony of vocational expert Michael Rosko, to whom the ALJ posed two hypothetical questions.  The first question satisfies the Varley standard of accuracy, as the ALJ asked Rosko to consider a hypothetical forty-year-old woman who suffered through Cooley's undisputed physical and mental impairments--severe daily headaches, depression, withdrawal, impatience, irritability, frequent crying, hurling things about the house, insomnia, low self-esteem, nightmares, fear of teenagers, fear of telephone calls, frequent anxiety, seizures, poor memory, indecision, unpredictable moods, easily frustrated and overwhelmed, and severely impaired concentration.  Assuming these impairments, the vocational expert testified it would be very difficult for the hypothetical woman to return to her past relevant work and that the impairment of her concentration "would probably preclude all jobs--skilled and unskilled for this hypothetical person."


16
Cooley attacks the second hypothetical question, in which the vocational expert was asked to assume the same impairments as above, except the woman's impairments did not substantially interfere with her concentration.  He testified this second hypothetical woman could not return to her past relevant work, but "there would be some unskilled jobs that generally fall within the parameters of this hypothetical question."    He testified there were approximately 20,000 strictly sedentary, unskilled jobs in the Detroit metropolitan area which she could perform, but if she tired easily and needed to lie down, she could not perform these jobs.


17
Cooley argues the second question is deficient because there is no evidence in the record that her concentration was intact between April 1981 and May 1984.  She criticizes the question as failing to portray her individual physical and mental impairments accurately as required by Varley, and asserts it cannot serve as substantial evidence.  We agree.  A review of the medical evidence in this case indicates that from the beginning of the record, one of the most frequently discussed and documented of Cooley's impairments is her inability to concentrate, her inability to remember, her inability to focus sufficiently to utter complete sentences without needing to stop and reflect midway through.


18
We find other defects in the second hypothetical question as well.  For example, the vocational expert assumed the hypothetical woman's continual and severe headaches were controlled by medication.  But there is no evidence that Cooley's headaches have ever been controlled or relieved.  Similarly, the vocational expert testified that the hypothetical woman could not perform unskilled jobs if she tired easily and needed to lie down during the day.  It is undisputed that Cooley is easily overwhelmed, both mentally and physically, and must lie down often because of fatigue.


19
In our analysis it may appear that we are weighing evidence or resolving conflicts therein, which would be outside our scope of review.  But the Varley inquiry of whether the Secretary produced substantial evidence that Cooley had retained the qualifications to perform specific jobs demands evaluation of the second hypothetical question, its failure to accurately portray Cooley's physical and mental impairments, and the resulting deficiency in the Secretary's evidence.  The hypothetical questions the Secretary relies upon for substantial evidence must adhere to the claimant's actual mental and physical impairments;  in this case, the second hypothetical question did not.2

III.

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is REVERSED, and this case is REMANDED with the instruction that Cooley's onset date of disability be fixed at April 6, 1981.

1
 The deterioration of Cooley's mental abilities is also documented.  In November 1981, she scored in the normal range of intellectual ability, with a full-scale IQ of 95, a performance IQ of 86, and a verbal IQ of 103.  By September 1984, her intellectual abilities had declined to the below average range, with a full-scale IQ of 87, a performance IQ of 80, and a verbal IQ of 95.  By February 1986, Cooley's intellectual abilities had deteriorated to the point where she could score only in the borderline range on intelligence tests, with a full-scale IQ of 72, a performance IQ of 67, and a verbal IQ of 78


2
 Because we find the Secretary's decision lacked substantial evidence, we need not address Cooley's alternate argument that she was rendered disabled by an organic brain disorder rather than an anxiety-related disability

MEMORANDUM
TROUTMAN, District Judge.
Disappearance of cash which plaintiff, an employee of defendants Penn Dairies, Inc. and Penn Supreme (Penn), claimed to have deposited on behalf of her employer with defendant National Central Bank (Bank), July 10, 1978, led to an investigation which culminated in plaintiff's arrest two months later. Plaintiff was taken into custody, processed, fingerprinted, photographed and held for preliminary arraignment. However, the District Attorney of Lancaster County dropped the charges shortly before the Bank discovered the missing deposits stuck in the night depository in January 1979. Plaintiff then commenced this action alleging violations of the Fourth, Fifth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments and the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983.[1]
Defendants, who now move to dismiss the complaint, include Penn, the Bank, two Penn employees, one Bank employee, and Detective Herman W. Simms, an employee of defendant City of Lancaster. Specifically, plaintiff charges that the Penn and Bank employees acted under color of state law and conspired to deprive her of constitutional rights by maliciously making misleading and false statements to Detective Simms "when they knew or in the exercise of reasonable investigation and care would have known (that the accusations) would result in the arrest and prosecution of the plaintiff" for violation of 18 Pa.Cons.Stat. Ann. § 3927(a)(Purdon).[2] On September 15, 1978, relying in part on statements made by the Penn and Bank employees, Simms executed a complaint before a Lancaster County Justice of the Peace, who determined that probable cause existed to believe that plaintiff committed the theft. With the warrant that issued upon the complaint Simms arrested plaintiff, who now alleges that the criminal proceedings were "instituted and continued against the plaintiff ... wholly without ... probable cause" and thus violative of the Fourth Amendment. The instant situation is therefore unlike Baker v. McCollan, ___ U.S. ___, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 61 L.Ed.2d 433 (1979), in which the respondent did not attack the validity of the warrant under which he was arrested. In fact in Baker the respondent's 1983 claim was based on a sheriff's actions after, not before, arrest.[3]Id. at ___, 99 S.Ct. 2689. In the case at bar plaintiff does attack the validity of the arrest warrant. Arrest without probable cause is a constitutional violation. Patzig v. O'Neil, 577 F.2d 841, 848 (3d Cir. 1978). The issue therefore arises whether an allegation of simple negligence states a claim for relief under § 1983; more specifically, whether Detective Simms is liable under § 1983 if he negligently caused plaintiff to be arrested upon less than probable cause. *976 Although the Supreme Court has expressly reserved deciding the matter, Baker v. McCollan, supra, Procunier v. Navarette, 434 U.S. 555, 98 S.Ct. 855, 55 L.Ed.2d 24 (1978), it has opined that the appropriate answer is "more elusive than it appears at first blush" and "may well not be susceptible of a uniform answer across the entire spectrum of conceivable constitutional violations which might be the subject of a § 1983 action". Baker v. McCollan, ___ U.S. at ___, 99 S.Ct. at 2692. See also Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 187, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961), in which the court held that a specific intent to violate a constitutional right is not required in a § 1983 action but did not reach the question of whether a general intent without regard to whether the acts specifically were intended to violate a person's civil rights was necessary for a § 1983 action to lie.
Neither the Fourth nor Fourteenth Amendments guarantees that only the guilty will be arrested. And the Due Process Clause specifically does not mandate that "every conceivable step be taken, at whatever cost, to eliminate the possibility of convicting an innocent person". Baker v. McCollan, ___ U.S. at ___, 99 S.Ct. at 2695, quoting Patterson v. New York, 432 U.S. 197, 208, 97 S.Ct. 2319, 53 L.Ed.2d 281 (1977). A fortiori, due process does not require exhaustion of every conceivable precaution to avert arresting an innocent person. Many courts agree that simple negligence may not form the predicate of a § 1983 claim. Page v. Sharpe, 487 F.2d 567, 569 (1st Cir. 1973) ("mere negligence, in the absence of conduct which shocks the conscious, in giving or failing to supply medical treatment to prisoners will not suffice"); Williams v. Vincent, 508 F.2d 541, 546 (2d Cir. 1974) ("an isolated omission to act by a state prison guard does not support a claim under section 1983 absent circumstances indicating an evil intent, or recklessness, or at least deliberate indifference to the consequence of his conduct"); Corby v. Conboy, 457 F.2d 251, 254 (2d Cir. 1972) (mere negligence by a state prison doctor does not support a claim of denial of federal constitutional rights); Patzig v. O'Neil, 577 F.2d at 848 ("police personnel may have acted negligently, perhaps even callously; but such actions do not amount to the `intentional conduct characterizing a constitutional infringement'"); Hampton v. Holmesburg Prison Officials, 546 F.2d 1077, 1081 (3d Cir. 1976) ("to establish a constitutional violation, the indifference must be deliberate and the actions intentional"); Howell v. Cataldi, 464 F.2d 272, 279 (3d Cir. 1972) (plaintiff must adduce proof of either "wrongful intention or culpable negligence"); Bryan v. Jones, 530 F.2d 1210, 1215 (5th Cir. 1976) (en banc) (a jailer whose errors in a record-keeping system fall outside of his realm of responsibility cannot be found liable if he has acted reasonably and in good faith); Puckett v. Cox, 456 F.2d 233, 235 (6th Cir. 1972) (more than an isolated incident of negligence must be alleged); Jamison v. McCurrie, 565 F.2d 483, 486 (7th Cir. 1977) ("there is no constitutional cause of action for mere negligence on the part of police officers . . .. Plaintiff must show that their misbehavior was either intentional or in reckless disregard of his constitutional rights"); McDonald v. Illinois, 557 F.2d 596, 601 (7th Cir. 1977) ("for plaintiff to state a cognizable claim, he must allege more than mere negligence on the part of . . . defendants"); Brown v. United States, 486 F.2d 284, 287 (8th Cir. 1973) ("we are extremely hesitant to hold that mere simple negligence can be the basis of personal liability under § 1983"). Cf. Procunier v. Navarette, 434 U.S. at 568, 98 S.Ct. at 863 ("one who does not intend to cause and does not exhibit deliberate indifference to the risk of causing the harm that gives rise to a constitutional claim is not liable for damages under § 1983") (Burger, C. J., dissenting). See also Stringer v. Chicago, 464 F.Supp. 887, 890 (N.D. Ill. 1979), Croswell v. O'Hara, 443 F.Supp. 895, 898 (E.D. Pa. 1978), Schweiker v. Gordon, 442 F.Supp. 1134, 1138 (E.D. Pa. 1977), and Jones v. McElroy, 429 F.Supp. 848, 863 (E.D. Pa. 1977).[4]
*977 To distill from these disquisitions the appropriate standard by which to evaluate plaintiff's claims is no simple matter. Nonetheless, the appropriate standard seems to include both a subjective and objective element under the circumstances. If Detective Simms, acting in good faith, sincerely believed that probable cause existed that plaintiff committed the theft, and if he did not know, nor reasonably should have known, that his official action would violate plaintiff's rights or if he acted without malicious intent to deprive plaintiff of her constitutional rights, then defendant is not liable. See also Wood v. Strickland, 420 U.S. 308, 321-22, 95 S.Ct. 992, 43 L.Ed.2d 214 (1975), Reese v. Nelson, 598 F.2d 822, 827 (3d Cir. 1979), and Princeton Community Phone Book, Inc. v. Bate, 582 F.2d 706, 711 (3d Cir. 1978) and compare with Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 247-48, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974) ("It is the existence of reasonable grounds for the belief formed at the time and in light of all the circumstances coupled with good-faith belief that afford a basis for qualified immunity of executive officers for acts performed in the course of official conduct"). Assuming the truth of plaintiff's allegation that Simms was negligent in determining probable cause, Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery and Chemical Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 86 S.Ct. 347, 15 L.Ed.2d 247 (1965), Cooper v. Pate, 378 U.S. 546, 84 S.Ct. 1733, 12 L.Ed.2d 1030 (1964), United States v. New Wrinkle, Inc., 342 U.S. 371, 72 S.Ct. 350, 96 L.Ed. 417 (1952), under the above described standard Simms' negligence did not rise to a level actionable under § 1983. Plaintiff concedes that Detective Simms relied only in part on his conversations with the Penn and Bank employees, logical and potentially knowledgeable people for Simms to question. Independent investigation may have corroborated their information. Absent knowledge of a history of antipathy between these employees and plaintiff or some other indicia to alert Simms to suspect the employees' credibility and to make detailed inquiry, Simms acted reasonably. Prior to arresting plaintiff Detective Simms submitted his findings to the scrutiny of a neutral judicial officer who agreed that probable cause existed. This is not a situation, therefore, where a police officer made a warrantless arrest upon his own sole evaluation of probable cause. An evil intent, recklessness or deliberate indifference to the consequences of his actions is not discernible. To hold that Simms' failure to ascertain that the Penn and Bank employees' information may have been the product of malice constituting reckless negligence sufficient to give rise to a § 1983 claim would impose herculean obligations on law enforcement officers. Such possibilities inhere in any situation in which private citizens provide information to an investigating officer. Unless the motivation for providing false or misleading information is readily apparent, a law enforcement officer cannot investigate or attempt to pierce the asserted for the actual motive behind every statement provided to him. Otherwise a police officer could never conclude that he had probable cause.
Defendant City of Lancaster is also not liable for
Congress did not intend municipalities to be held liable unless action pursuant to official municipal policy of some nature caused a constitutional tort. In particular . . . a municipality cannot be held liable solely because it employs a tortfeasor  or, in other words, a municipality cannot be held liable under § 1983 on a respondeat superior theory.

Nor are the other defendants liable; without Simms there is no "color of state law". For private persons to be liable under § 1983 they must be "jointly engaged with state officials in the prohibited action". Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 152, 90 *978 S.Ct. 1598, 1605-06, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970). Defendants' motions to dismiss will be granted.

PER CURIAM:*


1
According to the petition, which was filed on April 30, 1965, the plaintiffs are the widow and surviving children of William Dennis Brown, Jr., and, as such, they are the owners through inheritance of farmlands situated in East Carroll Parish, Louisiana. The lands in question are suitable for the production of rice; and prior to and during the crop year 1958, such lands received a rice acreage allotment of 307.5 acres in accordance with the provisions of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended. This statute, prior to 1958 and during the early part of that year, provided (among other things) for the establishment by the Secretary of Agriculture, on a calendar year basis, of a national acreage allotment for rice (7 U.S.C. § 1352 (1952)), for the apportionment of the national acreage allotment among the several rice-producing States (7 U.S.C. § 1353(a) (1952)), and for the allocation of each State acreage allotment "to farms owned or operated by persons who have produced rice in the State in any one of the five calendar years immediately preceding the year for which such apportionment is made on the basis of past production of rice in the State by the producer on the farm taking into consideration the acreage allotments previously established in the State for such owners or operators; abnormal conditions affecting acreage; land, labor, and equipment available for the production of rice; crop rotation practices; and the soil and other physical factors affecting the production of rice * * *" (7 U.S.C. § 1353(b) (1952, Supp. V)).


2
On June 4, 1958, the provision of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended, relating to the allocation of each State acreage allotment for rice at the farm level was further amended by Public Law 85-443 (72 Stat. 177). The petition alleges that, by virtue of this amendment, the rice acreage allotments for the geographical area in which the plaintiffs' lands are located were changed from the "farm" basis to the "producer" basis, and that the rice acreage allotment of 307.5 acres previously mentioned was divided between the plaintiffs and their tenants for the year 1959 and subsequent years, with the result that the plaintiffs were allocated only 79.9 acres for the production of rice in 1959 and subsequent years, the remaining 227.6 acres of the original 307.5-acre allotment being allocated to tenants who had theretofore participated in the gross proceeds of the rice produced from the plaintiffs' lands. This action, according to the petition, amounted to a taking of the plaintiffs' property for public use without just compensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States; and the plaintiffs seek to recover $68,280 as compensation in the present action.


3
The petition forthrightly states that the "Plaintiffs have also instituted suit before the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, Monroe Division, seeking further redress and adjudication in connection with the circumstances here set forth * * *."


4
The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the petition in this court, on the ground that the Court of Claims lacks jurisdiction of the case because of 28 U.S.C. § 1500 (1964), which declares that:


5
The Court of Claims shall not have jurisdiction of any claim for or in respect to which the plaintiff or his assignee has pending in any other court any suit or process against the United States or any person who, at the time when the cause of action alleged in such suit or process arose, was, in respect thereto, acting or professing to act, directly or indirectly under the authority of the United States.


6
A copy of the complaint filed by the plaintiffs in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana was attached to the defendant's motion to dismiss. The complaint in the District Court case was filed on April 29, 1965, or the day before the plaintiffs filed their petition in the Court of Claims case.


7
The defendants in the District Court case were the United States, the Louisiana Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Committee, and the East Carroll Parish Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Committee. The respective committees administer the rice program under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended, in the State of Louisiana and in East Carroll Parish. The operative facts alleged in the District Court case are the same as the facts alleged in the petition in this court. However, in the District Court case, the plaintiffs asserted alternatively (1) that the administrative officials misconstrued and misapplied the amendment of June 4, 1958, in depriving the plaintiffs of 227.6 acres of the rice acreage allotment previously allocated to their lands and, accordingly, that the plaintiffs are entitled to a reinstatement of the full amount of the previous rice acreage allotment; or (2) that if the amendment of June 4, 1958, has been properly construed and applied by the administrative officials, then the provisions of the amendment, as so construed and applied, have deprived the plaintiffs of their property without just compensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. In either event (according to the plaintiffs' allegations in the District Court case), they have been wrongfully deprived of 227.6 acres of their rice acreage allotment for 5 years, and they are entitled to recover compensation at the rate of $6,828 per year for each of the 5 years. The plaintiffs further said in the District Court case that they are asserting a separate claim for each year (doubtless having in mind the $10,000 limitation imposed by 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a) (2) (1964) on the jurisdiction of District Courts with respect to suits against the United States).


8
On October 1, 1965, this court, noting that "plaintiffs have previously filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, Monroe Division, seeking, as one alternative relief, just compensation for the taking of their property which claim is identical in substance to that asserted in the petition in this court and which claim remains pending in the said District Court" [emphasis added], dismissed the petition, without prejudice, on the basis of 28 U.S.C. § 1500, supra.


9
Plaintiffs moved for rehearing (in October 1965) on the ground that, in the District Court, the Government had moved to dismiss the alternative claim for just compensation as beyond that court's jurisdiction. Thereafter the plaintiffs filed a supplemental motion for rehearing indicating that the District Court, on December 9, 1965, had sustained the Government's motion and had dismissed on jurisdictional grounds the plaintiffs' claim for compensation. This court has ascertained that no appeal has been taken from that ruling and that the period for appeal has now expired. At the present time, therefore, the only claim for just compensation pending in a court is that stated in the plaintiffs' petition in this court.


10
In these circumstances we grant the motions for rehearing, vacate our prior order dismissing the petition, and now deny the defendant's motion to dismiss. Our earlier order of dismissal was predicated on the fact that the other "claim remains pending in the said District Court." That is no longer true, and the claim is no longer "pending in any other court." In this situation, we do not believe that 28 U.S.C. § 1500 requires us to deprive plaintiffs of the only forum they have in which to test their demand for just compensation. The District Court has decided that this claim is beyond its jurisdiction and plaintiffs have acquiesced in that ruling. Unless they can proceed in this court they will be unable to attempt to obtain a determination of the merits of this monetary claim. Section 1500 was designed to require an election between two forums both of which could presumably grant the same type of relief. See Casman v. United States, 135 Ct.Cl. 647 (1956); Tecon Engineers, Inc. v. United States, 343 F.2d 943, 945 ff., 170 Ct.Cl. 389, 393 ff. (1965), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 976, 86 S.Ct. 545, 15 L.Ed.2d 468 (1966). But Section 1500 was not intended to compel claimants to elect, at their peril, between prosecuting their claim in this court (with conceded jurisdiction, aside from Section 1500) and in another tribunal which is without jurisdiction. Once the claim has been rejected by the other court for lack of jurisdiction, there is no basis in the policy or wording of the statute for dismissal of the claim pending here. The plaintiffs could undoubtedly file a new petition, without any bar through Section 1500; it does not seem fair or make sense to insist that that must be done — with the limitations difficulties it may well entail. Tecon Engineers, Inc., supra, teaches that the section should be given a reasonable and just construction, not a doctrinaire or purely technical one. In that light, plaintiffs should now be able to proceed in this court.


11
Our prior holdings do not call for any different result. In British American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 89 Ct.Cl. 438, 441 (1939), cert. denied, 310 U.S. 627, 60 S.Ct. 974, 84 L.Ed. 1398 (1940), the other suit could and did proceed on the merits; in fact, this court emphasized several times that the determination of the other court was on the merits. In Wessel, Duval & Co. v. United States, 124 F.Supp. 636, 637-638, 129 Ct.Cl. 464, 466 (1954), the district court suit was still pending and there was no reason at all to believe that that tribunal lacked jurisdiction.1 In those circumstances this court refused to defer action pending the outcome of the suit in the district court but applied 28 U.S.C. § 1500 to dismiss the Court of Claims suit at once. In Los Angeles Shipbuilding & Drydock Corp. v. United States, 152 F.Supp. 236, 138 Ct.Cl. 648 (1957), the district court plainly had jurisdiction of the claim and this court held that the plaintiff had elected that tribunal as the desired forum over the Court of Claims. National Cored Forgings Co. v. United States, 132 F.Supp. 454, 132 Ct.Cl. 11 (1955), also involved another pending suit clearly within the jurisdiction of the district court in which it was brought. All of these cases, and the others involving Section 1500, were quite different from this case in its present posture.

Plaintiffs' motions for rehearing are granted, the dismissal without prejudice of plaintiffs' petition ordered on October 1, 1965, is vacated and set aside, defendant's motion to dismiss the petition is denied, and the case is returned to the trial commissioner for further proceedings.

Appeals from the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. (Nos. 98-00198-CR-T-26C

Before CARNES and RONEY, Circuit Judges, and ALAIMO*, District Judge.

        CARNES, Circuit Judge:

        Nicholas Grant appeals his convictions for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and
marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846, use of a firearm during a drug-trafficking crime, in violation of

18 U.S.C. § 924(c), and failure to appear, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 3146(a)(1). These questions are
presented: whether Grant's appeal on the conspiracy and firearms charges was timely; whether there was
sufficient evidence to convict him on the failure to appear and the conspiracy charges; and whether

statements of an alleged co-conspirator exculpating Grant were inconsistent statements admissible for
purposes of impeachment pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 806. We answer all three questions "yes."
The affirmative answer to the third one requires that we reverse Grant's conviction on the conspiracy and use

of a firearm charges.

                                                 A. FACTS

        In early 1993, United States Customs Service Special Agent Louis Mozas met with Deosie Wilson

and discussed Wilson's plan to have Mozas smuggle 2000 pounds of marijuana from Jamaica into the United

States, which Wilson would then sell. Jamaican police seized the marijuana which was to be smuggled in,
however, so the transaction was not consummated.
        Mozas next advised Wilson that Mozas would be smuggling one hundred kilograms of cocaine from

Columbia, for which he would be paid 18,000 pounds of marijuana. Wilson agreed to market that marijuana


    *

designation.
for Mozas. Upon inspection, Wilson deemed the marijuana to be of poor quality, but set out to market it

anyway. Mozas also advised Wilson that he had 15 kilograms of cocaine, and Wilson agreed to assist in
selling it.

           Wilson departed for Jamaica on March 12, 1993, and returned to Tampa on March 18, 1993. Mozas

picked up Wilson at the Tampa airport and took him to an undercover residence in Homosassa, Florida. In

connection with his planned purchase of the cocaine from Mozas, Wilson advised Mozas that $100,000 had
been transferred into Wilson's bank account and that the funds would be available the next day. On March

19, 1993, Mozas accompanied Wilson to a bank in Homosassa, Florida and was present when Wilson
obtained a cashier's check for $100,000. Mozas and Wilson then returned to the undercover residence.

           Later that same afternoon, Mozas dropped Wilson off at the same bank. Wilson remained inside the

bank for between one to five minutes before leaving with the occupants of a waiting Nissan Pathfinder.
Undercover agents followed the Pathfinder, which drove by the undercover residence and then to a restaurant.
A short while later, Wilson and Grant were observed leaving the restaurant and entering the Pathfinder. The

agents followed the Pathfinder as it returned to the undercover residence, where Wilson was dropped off.
The agents then followed the Pathfinder as it returned to the restaurant.

           Wilson arrived at the undercover residence carrying a bundle underneath his shirt. The agreement
between Mozas and Wilson provided that Wilson would purchase 10 kilograms of cocaine from Wilson at
$15,000 per kilogram, or $150,000 total. Wilson went into a bedroom at the residence and, upon his return,

produced a vinyl pouch containing $50,000 in United States currency.
           Mozas then instructed Detective Michael Joyner to bring the cocaine to the residence. Joyner brought

the cocaine and Wilson showed him the $100,000 cashier's check and $50,000 cash. Wilson told Mozas that
Grant was in Homosassa Springs, but that Grant did not want to meet anyone. Wilson then put down

$15,000, left with one kilogram of cocaine, and was arrested immediately thereafter. Wilson was talking on

a cell phone at the time of his arrest and the person to whom he was speaking was exclaiming "police, police,
police."

           Within one minute of being informed that Wilson had been arrested, the undercover agents observing

the Pathfinder saw Grant and his brother quickly run from the restaurant and depart in the Pathfinder. Grant

drove slowly by the location where Wilson was being arrested and then fled the area at approximately 80
miles per hour. After a brief chase, Grant was arrested and a search of the Pathfinder revealed two loaded

semi-automatic pistols, one in the glove compartment and another in a duffle bag on the floor in front of the
back seat, and an open briefcase containing $11,208.

         After his arrest, Grant told Customs Special Agent Phillip Aston that while he was in Jamaica Wilson
had contacted him about participating in a marijuana transaction. Grant did not, however, mention anything

about a cocaine transaction. Grant also told Aston that on March 18, 1993, he had traveled from Jamaica to

Miami with approximately $16,000 in cash. Grant had a passport bearing his photograph and name which

documented that he had left Jamaica on March 18, 1993. Grant admitted to Aston that he had been speaking
to Wilson on the telephone before Grant had run from the restaurant, but claimed that he and his brother had

decided that they did not want to participate in Wilson's transaction anymore and had decided to leave.
         Grant was released on bond on March 26, 1993. Four days later, he was indicted on one count of

conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846. Grant pleaded not

guilty at his arraignment. The United States requested a show cause hearing for revocation of Grant's bond
on the grounds that he had failed to comply with the conditions of his release. The magistrate judge
scheduled a show cause hearing for May 17, 1993. On May 4, 1993, the clerk's office sent notice of that

scheduled hearing to Grant. After Grant failed to appear for the show cause hearing, a warrant was issued
for his arrest.

         On February 16, 1998, a detective assigned to a Customs task force arrested Grant at the Miami
International Airport. At the time of his arrest, Grant possessed two Jamaican driver's licenses—both bearing
his photograph, but one in his name and one in the name of Rory Roberts. Grant was advised of his rights

and agreed to be interviewed. During that interview, Grant stated that there was a fugitive warrant issued for
his arrest and that he needed to use a different name to avoid arrest and prosecution in the United States. He

explained to the detective that the fugitive warrant was the result of an arrest that had occurred in Tampa on
a charge of attempting to purchase cocaine from undercover Customs agents and that he failed to appear in

court and had fled to Jamaica in order to avoid prosecution on that charge.

                                       B. PROCEDURAL HISTORY
         A superseding indictment was returned on March 19, 1998 charging Grant with one count of

conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846, and

one count of use of a firearm during a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c). Grant was

convicted by a jury on both counts on May 19, 1998.
         On May 14, 1998 Grant was indicted for failing to appear at the May 17, 1993 show cause hearing,

in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 3146(a)(1). After a bench trial, Grant was convicted of that charge on October
7, 1998.

           At a consolidated sentencing hearing on June 18, 1999, Grant was sentenced to imprisonment for 145
months for the conspiracy conviction, 60 months for the firearms conviction, and 6 months for the failure to

appear conviction, all sentences to run consecutively. Grant filed a motion for a new trial and a renewed

motion for judgment of acquittal, both of which were denied. Grant appeals his convictions on several

grounds. Among other things, he argues that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his convictions on the
failure to appear and the conspiracy charges. Grant also argues that evidence which would have impeached

testimony elicited from Wilson at trial was improperly excluded, in violation of Federal Rule of Evidence

806.1
                                               II. DISCUSSION

                                   A. THE JURISDICTIONAL QUESTION
           As a threshold matter, we must decide whether Grant's appeal of the conspiracy and firearms charges
is timely. After Grant's consolidated sentencing hearing, the district court entered one judgment as to both

cases. The judgment bore the district court case numbers for the conspiracy and firearms charges (93-83-CR-
T-26B) and for the failure to appear charges (98-198-CR-T-26C). The judgment was entered on June 24,
1999 as to case number 98-198-CR-T-26C, and on June 28, 1999 as to case number 93-83-CR-T-26B.

           On June 28, 1999, Grant filed a notice of appeal which stated that he was appealing "the Judgment
and Committment [sic] entered in this action on June 18, 1999."2 The notice of appeal, however, bore only
one case number, 98-198-CR-T-26C (the failure to appear case).

           On August 31, 1999, Grant filed a second notice of appeal bearing case number 93-83-CR-T-26B

(the 1993 drug case), along with a "motion to submit an out-of-time appeal," which indicated that case
number 93-83-CR-T-26B had been inadvertently omitted from the first notice of appeal due to a clerical error.

On October 1, 1999, the district court granted the motion to file out of time.
           "The timely filing of a notice of appeal is a mandatory prerequisite to the exercise of appellate



    1
     Because of our holding on this issue, we need not decide the other issues Grant raises in his appeal,
including Brady violations and an Apprendi challenge to his sentencing.
    2
     Although the district court judge signed the judgment on June 22, 1999, the judgment states that the
date of imposition of sentence is June 18, 1999, which was the date that the sentence was orally
pronounced. Cf. United States v. Morrison, 204 F.3d 1091, 1093-94 (11th Cir.2000) ("imposition of
sentence" in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(c) means the oral pronouncement of it, not the time
the written judgment is entered).
jurisdiction." United States v. Ward, 696 F.2d 1315, 1317 (11th Cir.1983) (citations omitted). Pursuant to

Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b)(1)(A), a defendant in a criminal case must file a notice of appeal

within 10 days after the entry of the judgment. Grant's second notice of appeal, regarding the 1993 drug case,
was not filed within this 10 day window.

        Rule 4(b) authorizes a 30 day extension upon a finding by the district court that the failure to file
within the original period resulted from "excusable neglect." Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4). Grant's second notice

of appeal, however, was filed on August 31, 1999, more than 30 days late, and therefore does not fall within

the Rule 4(b)(4) window, either.

        Nonetheless, Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(c)(4) provides that "[a]n appeal must not be
dismissed for informality of form or title of the notice of appeal." The advisory committee notes to that Rule

state that "so long as the function of notice is met by the filing of a paper indicating an intention to appeal,
the substance of the rule has been complied with." Fed. R.App. P. 3 advisory committee note. Further, "the
[R]ule makes it clear that dismissal of an appeal should not occur when it is otherwise clear from the notice

that the party intended to appeal." Id.; see also Smith v. Barry, 502 U.S. 244, 248-49, 112 S.Ct. 678, 682,

116 L.Ed.2d 678 (1992) ("If a document filed within the time specified by Rule 4 gives the notice required

by Rule 3, it is effective as a notice of appeal.").
         Although Grant's first notice of appeal only references case number 98-198-CR-T-26C, it also states
that he appeals "from the Judgment and Committment [sic] entered in this action on June 18, 1999." As we

have mentioned, a consolidated sentencing hearing on both cases was held in the district court, and there was
only one judgment and commitment order entered for both cases. That leads us to conclude that a timely
notice of appeal was filed from the single judgment and commitment order, even though that notice of appeal

mentioned only one of the two case numbers. We hold that Grant's first notice of appeal indicates an intent

to appeal both cases and that we do have jurisdiction. See Cobb v. Lewis, 488 F.2d 41, 44 (5th Cir.1974)

("Courts of appeals have discretion, when the interests of substantive justice require it, to disregard

irregularities in the form or procedure for filing a notice of appeal."), abrogated on other grounds, Kotam

Elects., Inc. v. JBL Consumer Prods., Inc., 93 F.3d 724 (11th Cir.1996).

    B. SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE TO CONVICT ON THE FAILURE TO APPEAR CHARGE

         Grant argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for failure to appear in
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 3146(a)(1), because there was no direct evidence that he received notice of the May
17, 1993 hearing on the order to show cause. He suggests that we conduct a de novo review of the evidence.

         We cannot try the case de novo but instead must sustain the verdict if there is substantial evidence

to support it. Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). In deciding

whether there was, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and give the

government the benefit of all reasonable inferences and credibility choices. Id.; United States v. Middleton,

690 F.2d 820, 827 (11th Cir.1982).

         The evidence shows without dispute that the clerk's office sent Grant notice of a hearing on an order
to show cause concerning modification or revocation of his bond, which was scheduled for May 17, 1993,

and that Grant did not appear at that hearing. He was arrested almost five years later, and at the time of his

arrest he was using an alias. He also told the arresting detective that he had skipped bond and fled the country
in order to avoid prosecution. He admitted to the detective that he knew there was a warrant issued for his

arrest and said that he had been using a false name to avoid arrest. He specifically said that he had failed to
appear in court. That is more than sufficient evidence to support the conviction.
        C. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE TO CONVICT ON THE CONSPIRACY CHARGE

         Next, Grant contends that there was insufficient evidence to establish that he knowingly agreed to
join or participate in a conspiracy with Wilson to possess and distribute cocaine and marijuana.3 He argues
that his presence and association with Wilson, coupled with evidence of flight, is insufficient to sustain his

conspiracy conviction.
         In order to establish the existence of a drug conspiracy between Grant and Wilson, the government

must prove that there was an agreement between the two of them to violate the narcotics laws. See United

States v. Farris, 77 F.3d 391, 394 (11th Cir.1996); United States v. Blasco, 702 F.2d 1315, 1330 (11th

Cir.1983). The existence of a conspiracy can be established by either direct evidence or circumstantial

evidence, such as inferences drawn from conduct. Farris, 77 F.3d at 394; Blasco, 702 F.2d 1330.

         The evidence supporting Grant's involvement in the conspiracy, viewed in the light most favorable

to the conviction, is as follows. Grant traveled from Jamaica to Florida on March 18, 1993, the same day that

Wilson traveled from Jamaica to Florida to conduct the cocaine transaction and one day before the transaction
occurred. Grant then met Wilson at a bank, they left the bank together, and they drove by the residence where



    3
    Grant does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction on the firearms
charge.
the cocaine transaction was to occur. Grant and Wilson then went to a restaurant, and after a short while

Grant drove Wilson, who now possessed $50,000 in currency, to the residence of the undercover agent. At
that residence, Wilson took delivery of one kilogram of cocaine and left after telling the agent that he was

going to deliver the cocaine to the buyer. At the time of Wilson's arrest, almost immediately after his

departure from the residence, he was on the telephone with Grant. Following his arrest, Grant admitted to

the agent that while he was in Jamaica he had been contacted by Wilson to come to the United States to
participate in a marijuana transaction. Grant was arrested after a high-speed flight from the area following

Wilson's arrest, and there were loaded weapons and a large amount of cash in the vehicle. Grant later fled
the country in order to avoid prosecution.

        Based on this evidence, a reasonable jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt, as the jury in this

case did, that Grant was guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and marijuana. See

Farris, 77 F.3d at 394-95.

                                         D. THE RULE 806 ISSUE

        At trial, the government used as evidence against Grant statements that had been made by
co-conspirator Wilson during the course of the conspiracy. Those statements were admitted under Federal
Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E), which allows co-conspirator statements to be admitted as substantive evidence

against a defendant. Agent Mozas testified extensively regarding statements Wilson had made to him during
the course of the conspiracy while Mozas was acting undercover. Those statements involved: (1) Wilson's

plans to import marijuana into the United States; (2) Wilson's claims that he had a partner in Jamaica who
was his neighbor; (3) Wilson's comments that he had buyers who would assist him in distributing marijuana
and cocaine; and (4) Wilson's intent, after purchasing one kilogram of cocaine from the undercover agent,

to take the cocaine to his partner for testing and evaluation.
        The statements of Wilson that Mozas testified about on direct examination did not directly mention

Grant, but on cross-examination when asked whether Grant was ever present during any of the transactions

between the undercover agents and Wilson, Mozas testified that Wilson had told him Grant was in Homosassa

Springs and did not want to meet with anyone.
        Grant attempted to impeach the Wilson conspiracy statements that had been put into evidence through

Mozas' testimony by introducing an affidavit which an attorney for Grant had obtained from Wilson in

Jamaica. The affidavit was executed after the conspiracy ended and following Wilson's deportation to that
country. The affidavit contained Wilson's sworn statements: that Grant had no knowledge of Wilson's

actions in consummating the drug deal with the agents; that Wilson had falsely told the undercover agents
he had a partner because Wilson did not want them to think he was acting alone; that Wilson had asked Grant

to meet him in Tampa to loan him money; that none of the $50,000 in cash Wilson possessed came from

Grant; and that Wilson had lied to the undercover agents about Grant not wanting to meet with anyone

because Wilson was carrying a large amount of cash and wanted the undercover agents (whom he believed
to be criminals) to think he had a partner. The district court refused to admit any of Wilson's affidavit

statements, however, finding that they were not inconsistent, as required by Rule 806, with the statements
of Wilson admitted through Mozas' testimony.

        Federal Rule of Evidence 806 provides, in relevant part:

        When a hearsay statement, or a statement defined in Rule 801(d)(2)(C), (D), or (E), has been
        admitted in evidence, the credibility of the declarant may be attacked, and if attacked may be
        supported, by any evidence which would be admissible for those purposes if declarant had testified
        as a witness. Evidence of a statement or conduct by the declarant at any time, inconsistent with the
        declarant's hearsay statement, is not subject to any requirement that the declarant may have been
        afforded an opportunity to deny or explain.

Fed.R.Evid. 806.
        The government's principal argument mirrors the district court's reasoning that none of the statements
in Wilson's affidavit are inconsistent with or contradictory to Wilson's conspiracy statements which were

admitted through Mozas' testimony. The government points out that none of Wilson's conspiracy statements
which were admitted at trial specifically identify Grant as Wilson's partner or as the source of any money used
in the transaction. The only testimony that specifically identifies Grant, which was that Wilson had told the

agents Grant was in Homosassa Springs and did not want to meet anyone, was elicited by Grant on
cross-examination of Wilson and was not, the government contends, contradicted by anything in Wilson's

affidavit.

        The government's conception of inconsistency is too narrow. Although Grant was specifically

identified by Mozas only during cross-examination, his testimony in its entirety did circumstantially link
Grant to the conspiracy. At the very least, it indicated that Wilson had a co-conspirator. The government

attempted to avoid Rule 806 by carefully ensuring that Mozas, in testifying about Wilson's statements during

the conspiracy, never specifically identified Grant as Wilson's co-conspirator, at least on direct examination,
and then presenting other evidence indicating that Grant was Wilson's co-conspirator.4 Wilson's statements

in the proffered affidavit, however, indicate that he had no co-conspirator and, further, that Grant had no
involvement in Wilson's drug transactions.

        The Rule 806 test is not whether the inconsistent statements relate to the identity of co-conspirators;

that's not what the Rule says. Instead, it says that "any" evidence is admissible "which would be admissible

... if [the] declarant had testified as a witness" from the stand. Fed.R.Evid. 806. If Wilson had been called
as a witness and testified, for example, that he was taking the cocaine he was buying to his partner to test and

evaluate it, his affidavit statements indicating that he had lied to the agents when he told them he had a partner
would surely be admissible. Likewise, if Wilson had testified and during cross-examination had said that

Grant did not want to meet with anyone, his affidavit statement that he had lied about that would be

admissible to impeach him. The test is whether the out-of-court statements would have been admissible for
impeachment purposes had the co-conspirator statements been delivered from the witness stand by the
co-conspirator himself, not as hearsay about what he said during the conspiracy but as contemporaneous

in-court statements.

        The government's position in this case echos its unsuccessful argument in United States v. Wali, 860

F.2d 588 (3d Cir.1988), which involved a remarkably similar Rule 806 issue. That case involved Abdul
Wali's conviction on charges of conspiracy to import Schedule I controlled substances in violation of 21

U.S.C. §§ 846 & 963. Wali, 860 F.2d at 589. An undercover DEA agent testified at Wali's trial as to

statements made during the conspiracy by a drug kingpin, Stanley Karl Esser, which implicated a person

named "Hadji" as the source of narcotics. Id. The district court, however, denied Wali's attempt to impeach

Esser's credibility by admitting inconsistent statements Esser had made to the undercover DEA Agent and

to Dutch authorities which exonerated Wali. Id. at 589-90.

        On appeal, the government argued that Esser's exculpatory statements were not inconsistent and

therefore not admissible pursuant to Rule 806, because in his inculpatory co-conspirator statements "Esser



    4
      That other evidence included the fact that Grant traveled from Jamaica to Florida on the same day
that Wilson did, met Wilson at a bank and left with him, and they drove by the undercover residence
together. Grant and Wilson also went to a restaurant together, before Grant drove Wilson, who possessed
$50,000 in cash, to the undercover residence. At the time of his arrest, Wilson was on the telephone with
Grant, and Grant admitted that while he was in Jamaica Wilson had contacted him to come to the United
States to participate in a marijuana transaction. Grant was also arrested after a high-speed flight shortly
after Wilson's arrest in a vehicle containing two firearms and a large amount of cash. Grant later fled the
country to avoid prosecution.
never stated that Abdul Wali was either the source of his narcotics or the 'Hadji' who supplied him." Id. at

591. The government claimed that Wali's identity as the "Hadji" who supplied the narcotics was established

only circumstantially through evidence other than the co-conspirator statements. Id. The Third Circuit

rejected that argument, holding that although Esser's co-conspirator statements never specifically identified
Wali as the "Hadji" who was the source of his narcotics, the government had used those statements to prove

the existence of a conspiracy to import drugs, thereby inculpating Wali. Id.

         The Third Circuit's analysis in Wali is sound and fits snugly onto our facts. The government used

Wilson's co-conspirator statements to help establish the existence of a conspiracy to distribute cocaine and

marijuana, which is one of the elements of the crime charged against Grant. The statements in Wilson's

affidavit were inconsistent with the existence of any conspiracy at all, and for that reason were inconsistent
with his co-conspirator statements.

         The government's first fallback argument is that even if the co-conspirator statements of Wilson

admitted at trial were inconsistent with the affidavit statements, the affidavit is inadmissible under Federal
Rule of Evidence 4035 because its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect. That is not the
ground upon which the district court excluded the evidence. Nonetheless, the government maintains that the

affidavit evidence would be unfairly prejudicial because the statements, if believed, would provide Grant with
a complete defense, rather than merely impeaching Wilson's co-conspirator statements admitted through

Mozas.

         Rule 403 is an "extraordinary remedy," United States v. Utter, 97 F.3d 509, 514-15 (11th Cir.1996)

(citation omitted), whose "major function ... is limited to excluding matter of scant or cumulative probative

force, dragged in by the heels for the sake of its prejudicial effect," United States v. Cross, 928 F.2d 1030,

1048 (11th Cir.1991) (internal quotation omitted). The Rule carries a "strong presumption in favor of

admissibility." United States v. Church, 955 F.2d 688, 703 (11th Cir.1992). Wilson's inculpatory

co-conspirator statements were important pieces of evidence in the government's case. The impeaching

statements in the affidavit would serve to cast doubt on Wilson's credibility and would have significant



    5
     Federal Rule of Evidence 403 provides, in relevant part:

                 Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially
                 outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice ...

         Fed.R.Evid. 403.
probative value for that purpose. Whatever prejudice to the government that might occur from admitting the
affidavit statements could not substantially outweigh their probative value, anymore than it could if those

affidavit statements had been admitted for impeachment following live testimony of Wilson to the same effect

as his co-conspirator statements. The evidence of the affidavit statements could do no more than impeach

and could not provide "a complete defense" if the government requested the limiting instruction to which it

would have been entitled. See Weeks v. Angelone, 528 U.S. 225, 234, 120 S.Ct. 727, 733, 145 L.Ed.2d 727

(2000) ("A jury is presumed to follow its instructions.").

        The government's second fallback argument is that Wilson's affidavit statements were properly
excluded from evidence because they were particularly unreliable, even though that was not the basis of the

district court's ruling. The government points out that Wilson continued to inculpate Grant in the conspiracy

after his arrest and before a federal grand jury, and only gave statements exculpating Grant after he had been
deported to Jamaica and was no longer subject to prosecution for perjury.6 The government maintains that
because the statements in the affidavit were so unreliable, admitting them would not have affected the

outcome of the trial—sort of a harmless error argument.
        The government's argument on this point is more than a little inconsistent with its Rule 403 argument

that the affidavit statements were terribly prejudicial to its case. Putting that inconsistency aside, however,
Rule 806 made the statements admissible for impeachment purposes, and the point of admitting inconsistent
statements to impeach is not to show that they are true, but to aid the jury in deciding whether the witness is

credible; the usual argument of the party doing the impeaching is that the inconsistent statements show the

witness is too unreliable to be believed on important matters. See United States v. Graham, 858 F.2d 986,

990 n. 5 (5th Cir.1988) ("[T]he hallmark of an inconsistent statement offered to impeach a witness's testimony

is that the statement is not hearsay within the meaning of the term, i.e., it is not offered for the truth of the

matter asserted, see Fed.R.Evid. 801(c); rather, it is offered only to establish that the witness has said both



    6
    Federal Rule of Evidence 806 provides that if the credibility of the declarant is attacked, it may be
supported by any evidence which would be admissible for those purposes if he testified as a witness. We
have no occasion to express a view upon whether the other out-of-court statements of Wilson, such as his
grand jury testimony, will be admissible once his affidavit statements come into evidence.

                 Likewise, we do not have occasion to decide at this time whether, by giving affidavit
        statements as Wilson did in this case, a co-conspirator waives his privilege against
        self-incrimination. Nor do we express any view on whether, if the government attempts to
        depose the co-conspirator affiant or call him to the stand, and he refuses to answer questions on
        the subject matter addressed in his affidavit statements, those statements must be stricken.
'x' and 'not x' and is therefore unreliable."). Given all the circumstances of this case, that strategy might well

have worked to undermine the probative effect of Wilson's co-conspirator statements to such an extent that
the verdict on the conspiracy charge would have been different. For that reason, we reverse Grant's

conviction on that charge.

        As to Grant's conviction for using a firearm during a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C.

§ 924(c), the conspiracy was the only drug trafficking crime that the indictment alleged as that essential
element of the firearms charge. Accordingly, the exclusion of the affidavit statements also requires reversal

of Grant's conviction on the firearms charge.
                                             III. CONCLUSION

        There was sufficient evidence to support Grant's conviction for failure to appear and we AFFIRM

his conviction on that charge. We do have jurisdiction over Grant's appeal of the conspiracy and firearms
charges, and there was sufficient evidence to support Grant's conviction on those charges. However, the
district court erroneously excluded Wilson's statements contained in his affidavit and, accordingly, we

REVERSE the judgment of conviction and sentence for both the conspiracy and firearms charges, and
REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

                             ORDER AND JUDGMENT *


Before TACHA, PORFILIO, and TYMKOVICH, Circuit Judges.



         Plaintiff appellant Kevin Sanchez filed a complaint in district court under

42 U.S.C. § 1983 claiming that he received negligent medical treatment while he

was incarcerated in the San Juan County New Mexico Detention Center. The


*
       After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined
unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of
this appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is
therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is
not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata,
and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value
consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.
district court adopted the findings and proposed disposition of the magistrate

judge and granted summary judgment to defendants based on grounds of both

claim and issue preclusion, and plaintiff appeals. “On account of [plaintiff’s] pro

se status, we liberally construe his filings, but hold him to the same rules of

procedure as other litigants.” Davis v. Kan. Dep’t of Corrs., 507 F.3d 1246, 1247

n.1 (10th Cir. 2007). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and, after our

de novo review of the grant of summary judgment, Simms v. Okla. ex rel. Dep’t of

Mental Health & Substance Abuse Servs., 165 F.3d 1321, 1326 (10th Cir. 1999),

we affirm.

      In May 2006, plaintiff brought a state-court action against defendant Havel

and Correctional Healthcare Management alleging false imprisonment and

medical negligence. Because plaintiff’s claims were barred by the applicable

statute of limitations, the state court dismissed all of his claims with prejudice.

Sanchez v. Havel, No. CV-06-562-3 (N.M. 11th Judicial Dist. Ct. filed Nov. 7,

2006) (Sanchez I). Plaintiff then filed the instant action in federal court making

substantially the same allegations regarding medical negligence that he did in

state court but including Mya Donaldson as an additional defendant.

      With regard to the claims against defendant Havel, the district court

correctly concluded that the doctrine of claim preclusion barred plaintiff’s attempt

to relitigate the issues he raised in Sanchez I. It also correctly determined that

issue preclusion similarly barred the claims against defendant Donaldson. We

                                          -2-
therefore affirm the judgment of the district court for substantially the reasons

stated by that court.

        Plaintiff’s argument that the district court erred in failing to order

defendants to produce pertinent medical records is unavailing because plaintiff

cannot proceed with this action in the first instance. Further, there is no factual

support for plaintiff’s charge that the court was biased against him because of his

inmate status or because he was not a state or city employee. Plaintiff’s charge in

his “closeing [sic] statement and facts” that certain individuals conspired to

intercept his outgoing legal mail was not included in the complaint and thus not

before the district court. As such, it will not be considered on appeal. Walker v.

Mather (In re Walker), 959 F.2d 894, 896 (10th Cir. 1992).

        To the extent plaintiff asserts error in the court’s denial of his motion to

reopen the case, construed as a Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) motion, we find no abuse of

discretion in that decision. See Butler v. Kempthorne, 532 F.3d 1108, 1110

(10th Cir. 2008). Plaintiff’s motion for judgment in his favor is DENIED.

Plaintiff’s motion for leave to proceed on appeal without prepayment of costs or

fees is GRANTED. Plaintiff is reminded of his obligation to continue making

partial payments pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(b) until the filing fee is paid in

full.




                                            -3-
The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.

CARLTON G. BEALL
v.
CECELIA M. BEALL.
No. 1065, September Term, 1979.
Court of Special Appeals of Maryland.
Decided May 8, 1980.
*490 The cause was argued before MOORE, LOWE and COUCH, JJ.
J. Frederick Garner, with whom was C. Calvert Lancaster on the brief, for appellant.
Steven Rosen, with whom were Willoner, Calabrese & Rosen, P.A. on the brief, for appellee.
MOORE, J., delivered the opinion of the Court.
This appeal concerns an alleged option agreement and a suit by Carlton G. Beall for the specific performance thereof. The Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Melbourne, J.) found the agreement unsupported by consideration and dismissed plaintiff's bill of complaint pursuant to Maryland Rule 535. From that order, he appeals to this Court.

I
In 1968, the plaintiff, Carlton G. Beall, purchased a farm in Prince George's County from Pearl Beall. At that time, the property was farmed by Pearl's son, Calvin Beall. The record discloses that Carlton, the plaintiff, and Calvin were second cousins. Calvin was married to Cecelia M. Beall, the defendant herein. Carlton agreed that Calvin could continue to farm the property if he would pay the annual property taxes. Calvin and Cecelia owned and resided on a parcel of about one-half acre that was bordered on three sides by the farm bought by the plaintiff; and it is that parcel that is the subject of this dispute.
On the day that plaintiff contracted to buy Pearl's farm, he obtained a three-year option to purchase Calvin's and *491 Cecelia's parcel for $28,000.00. The option recited a consideration of $100.00 which was paid by check. In 1971, the parties executed a new option, for five years, but on the same terms and reciting an additional $100.00 consideration.
This 1971 option was never exercised by the plaintiff, but prior to its expiration the following language was appended at the bottom of the page:
"As of October 6, 1975, we, Calvin E. Beall and Cecelia M. Beall, agree to continue this option agreement three more years  Feb. 1, 1976 to Feb. 1, 1979.
/s/ Calvin E. Beall
/s/ Cecelia M. Beall."
It is this purported extension that forms the basis for plaintiff's bill of complaint seeking specific performance of the agreement. Calvin died in August 1977, and Cecelia now holds the fee simple title by right of survivorship. In letters dated May 24, 1978 and September 14, 1978, the plaintiff advised Cecelia that he was electing to exercise the option. He scheduled settlement for October 5, 1978. As the chancellor found:
"It is undisputed in this case that Mr. Carlton Beall did eventually hire attorneys to search the title, set a settlement date, attend the settlement, and was ready, willing and able to perform the contract."
Cecelia refused to attend settlement, and this suit for specific performance ensued.
At trial, after plaintiff presented his evidence, Cecelia moved to dismiss the bill of complaint. The chancellor granted the motion because she felt that the option agreements were not supported by consideration in that "no benefit ... flowed to Cecelia Beall." In addition, as to the 1975 alleged option, the chancellor ruled:
"[T]here is no consideration recited in that extension or purported extension of the original *492 option contract. And the one extension that had occurred in the interim, even then would also fail because there is no consideration stated in the extension. It is clear that consideration must pass for the extension each time, in some form of consideration. None is stated within the written four lines."
On appeal, the plaintiff contends that the chancellor erred in dismissing the bill of complaint and in excluding certain testimony relative to oral transactions with Calvin, the deceased husband of the defendant.

II
Under Maryland law it is clear that "an option is not a mere offer to sell, which can be withdrawn by the optionor at any time before acceptance, but a binding agreement if supported by consideration." Blondell v. Turover, 195 Md. 251, 256, 72 A.2d 697, 699 (1950). In other words, an option is an agreement to keep an offer open that requires consideration to give it its irrevocable character. Goldman v. Connecticut General Life Insurance Co., 251 Md. 575, 581, 248 A.2d 154, 158 (1968). Once the option is exercised by the optionee a binding contract is created that may be enforced through a decree commanding specific performance. Diggs v. Siomporas, 248 Md. 677, 681, 237 A.2d 725, 727 (1968); Blondell v. Turover, supra, 195 Md. at 256, 72 A.2d at 699. It is apparent, then, that an option must be supported by consideration in order to be irrevocable for the period provided in the option.
When, however, the consideration allegedly supporting an option fails or is nonexistent, the option is no longer irrevocable but rather it becomes "a mere offer to sell, which can be withdrawn by the optionor at any time before acceptance...." Blondell v. Turover, supra, 195 Md. at 256, 72 A.2d at 699. The failure of consideration destroys the irrevocability of the option; it nonetheless retains its essential characteristic as an offer to buy or sell for the *493 period stated in the option or until revoked. It has been recognized that equity will enforce a resulting contract despite lack of consideration for the option:
"While the rule that equity will enforce a contract consummated by the acceptance of an option within the time and upon the terms of the option is often stated in such a way as to suggest or imply the necessity of consideration for the option, all that is meant in most cases is that a consideration is necessary to prevent the defendant from asserting his withdrawal of the option before its acceptance by the plaintiff and before the expiration of the time fixed in the option within which acceptance could be made."
71 Am.Jur.2d, Specific Performance § 143 (1973) (footnotes omitted). See 1A Corbin on Contracts § 263 (1963). See generally Kahn v. General Development Corp., 40 Del. Ch. 83, 92, 174 A.2d 307, 312 (1961) (failure of consideration "destroyed the irrevocability of the option"). Burkhead v. Farlow, 266 N.C. 595, 597, 146 S.E.2d 802, 804 (1966) (option without consideration was "mere offer to sell which defendants might have withdrawn at any time before acceptance"); Rose v. Minis, 41 N.J. Super. 538, 543, 125 A.2d 535, 538 (1956) (option which is mere offer is "simply a naked revocable authority").
Assuming, arguendo, that the 1975 option was unsupported by consideration, it remained as an offer to sell the parcel for $28,000. The offer was open until February 1, 1979, but it was revocable at any time by action of Calvin and Cecelia Beall. As stated in the case of Holifield v. Veterans' Farm & Home Board, 218 Miss. 446, 450, 67 So.2d 456, 457 (1953):
"It is well settled that an option is not binding as a contract where there is no consideration, unless it is accepted within the time limit and before the offer is withdrawn. Since there was no consideration paid by the Veterans' Farm and Home Board and *494 Mauldin for the option, it could have been revoked by the Holifields at any time before the Veterans' Farm and Home Board and Mauldin notified them that they intended to buy the land; but since the offer was accepted within the time limit and before withdrawal, the contract became binding upon all parties as it was thereafter supported by the consideration of the mutual promises." (Emphasis added.)
This statement is generally in accord with the Maryland cases, supra.
The chancellor should, therefore, have determined whether or not there was a valid, unrevoked offer to sell the property in dispute and whether or not there was a proper acceptance of that offer sufficient to create a contract specifically enforceable in equity.[1] These issues of offer and acceptance primarily involve factual determinations that initially must be evaluated by the chancellor. As an appellate court, we are limited to a review of the chancellor's findings under the "clearly erroneous" standard. Md. Rule 1086. But our review is dependent upon the existence of factual findings on the issues material to the case. Such findings were not made below.
It was error for the chancellor to dismiss plaintiff's bill of complaint at the close of his case. A new trial, in accordance with this opinion, is necessitated.
Order reversed; cause remanded for a new trial in accordance with this opinion; costs to abide the final result.
NOTES
[1]  We express no opinion concerning the validity of the chancellor's finding that there was no consideration for the option.

MEMORANDUM OPINION
BLOCH, District Judge.
Presently before the Court is defendant's motion for partial summary judgment. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, the Court will grant the defendant's motion.

I. Background
The facts of record are as follows.
In 1978, plaintiff purchased a tractor trailer and started a trucking company called Halfhill Trucking (HT), a sole proprietorship. Plaintiff operated HT as a leasing venture; that is, plaintiff leased HT's truck to various interstate commerce carriers and also provided a truck driver who hauled loads for the carriers.
During 1978 and the first half of 1979, plaintiff's son, Ken Halfhill (Halfhill), was HT's sole truck driver. Although Halfhill's primary duty was to drive the truck, Halfhill also had the authority to negotiate with the carriers regarding future leasing of HT's truck. HT, via plaintiff, paid Halfhill based on a percentage of what the carriers paid to lease the truck.
During the 1978-1979 period, plaintiff treated Halfhill as his employee and issued him federal Form W-2's. Plaintiff also paid the required federal employment taxes, including social security and unemployment taxes, on Halfhill's earnings.
In the middle of 1979, however, Halfhill left HT and became an employee of Sentle Trucking (Sentle). Plaintiff thus decided to modify HT's business, leasing HT's truck to only one carrier  Sentle.
Subsequently, in late 1981, Sentle's business was deteriorating and Sentle's exclusive lease with plaintiff expired. Plaintiff did not renew this lease; rather, plaintiff purchased another truck and in 1982 began operating HT in a manner more similar to when plaintiff had started the company. Specifically, HT's trucks were leased to different carriers and Halfhill, who had left Sentle, as well as other individuals, drove HT's trucks for the carriers. All of the drivers of HT's trucks had the authority to negotiate leases with the carriers, and plaintiff paid the drivers based on a percentage of what the carriers paid to lease the trucks, as Halfhill was paid in the past.
From 1982 until mid-1990, however, plaintiff did not treat the individuals who drove HT's trucks as employees. Rather, plaintiff considered the drivers, including Halfhill, to be independent contractors for federal tax purposes and, therefore, plaintiff did not pay employment taxes on the drivers' compensation.
Eventually, in light of tax assessments levied by the Internal Revenue Service, plaintiff paid employment taxes for his drivers for the second half of 1990 in the amount of $49.24. After paying this amount, plaintiff filed an administrative claim seeking a refund of the same. The IRS denied the plaintiff's administrative claim, and plaintiff instituted the instant action seeking a refund of the employment taxes that he had paid. Plaintiff claims that he is entitled to this refund on the ground that HT's drivers are independent contractors, not his employees. Moreover, plaintiff contends that even if the drivers are his employees, plaintiff is entitled to protection under § 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978  which exempts certain employers from tax liability when they have in good faith misclassified their employees as independent contractors.
Defendant contests plaintiff's entitlement to a refund, asserting that HT's drivers are, in fact, employees of plaintiff and that plaintiff is not entitled to protection under § 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978. Moreover, defendant filed a counterclaim against plaintiff seeking to recover $222,720.45 of unpaid employment taxes assessed against plaintiff for *174 the 1988 through 1990 tax years. Plaintiff denies liability with regard to the defendant's counterclaim for the same reason that he asserts that he is entitled to a refund.
At this time, defendant has moved for summary judgment with regard to the single issue of whether plaintiff is entitled to relief under § 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978.[1]

II. Discussion
Summary judgment may be granted if "the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). "Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against the party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). In considering a motion for summary judgment, this Court must examine the facts in a light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. Big Apple BMW, Inc. v. BMW of North America, Inc., 974 F.2d 1358, 1363 (3d Cir.1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 912, 113 S.Ct. 1262, 122 L.Ed.2d 659 (1993); International Raw Materials, Ltd. v. Stauffer Chemical Co., 898 F.2d 946, 949 (3d Cir.1990). Thus, where the non-moving party's evidence contradicts the movant's, the Court must accept the non-movant's evidence as true. Country Floors, Inc. v. Partnership Composed of Gepner and Ford, 930 F.2d 1056, 1061 (3d Cir.1991).
The burden is on the moving party to demonstrate that the evidence creates no genuine issue of material fact. Chipollini v. Spencer Gifts, Inc., 814 F.2d 893, 896 (3d Cir.) (en banc), cert. dismissed, 483 U.S. 1052, 108 S.Ct. 26, 97 L.Ed.2d 815 (1987). Where the non-moving party will bear the burden of proof at trial, the party moving for summary judgment may meet its burden by showing that "the evidentiary materials of record, if reduced to admissible evidence, would be insufficient to carry the non-movant's burden of proof at trial." Id.; Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. at 2552. The non-moving party "must set forth specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial and may not rest upon mere allegations, general denials, or ... vague statements." Quiroga v. Hasbro, Inc., 934 F.2d 497, 500 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 940, 112 S.Ct. 376, 116 L.Ed.2d 327 (1991). If the non-moving party does produce contradictory evidence, however, then the "believability and weight of the evidence remains the province of the factfinder." Big Apple, 974 F.2d at 1363.
In this case, defendant asserts that it is entitled to summary judgment with regard to plaintiff's claim that he qualifies for relief from tax liability under § 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978. More specifically, defendant asserts that plaintiff is not entitled to protection under § 530 because he cannot meet § 530's "consistency requirement." Plaintiff, on the other hand, contends that there are material issues of fact in dispute with regard to this claim that preclude a grant of summary judgment.

A. Federal employment taxes and § 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978
Under the Internal Revenue Code, "employers must pay social security and unemployment taxes on behalf of their employees." Hospital Resource Personnel, Inc. v. United States, 68 F.3d 421, 424 (11th Cir.1995).[2] "These taxes are known collectively as `employment taxes.'" Id. "Employers are only required to ... pay these *175 employment taxes, however, in regard to payments to `employees,' not to `independent contractors.'" Id. "In connection with payments to `independent contractors,' employers only have to send annual information returns, on Form 1099 to the worker and on Forms 1096 and 1099 to the IRS, indicating the income paid [to the independent contractor] during the year." Id.; see also Boles Trucking, Inc. v. United States, No. 95-1826, 77 F.3d 236, 238-39 (8th Cir.1996). In light of these tax consequences, their proper characterization of the employment relationship is vital.
Under certain circumstances, however, an employer who has mistakenly treated its employees as independent contractors  and has thus failed to pay the required employment taxes  may be relieved of its tax liability pursuant to § 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978. Congress created the "safe harbor" provisions of § 530 in order to alleviate "what was perceived as overly zealous pursuit and assessment of taxes and penalties against employers who had, in good faith, misclassified their employees as independent contractors." Boles Trucking, Inc., supra, at 239; see also In re Rasbury, 141 B.R. 752, 761 (N.D.Ala.1992).
Section 530 provides in relevant part that:
(a) Termination of certain tax liability. 
(1) In general.  If
(A) for purposes of employment taxes, the taxpayer did not treat an individual as an employee for any period, and
(B) in the case of periods after December 31, 1978, all Federal tax returns (including information returns) required to be filed by the taxpayer with respect to such individual for such period are filed on the basis consistent with the individual not being an employee,
then ... the individual shall be deemed not to be an employee unless the taxpayer had no reasonable basis for not treating such individual as an employee.
* * * * * *
(3) Consistency required in the case of prior tax treatment.  Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to the treatment of any individual for employment tax purposes ... if the taxpayer (or predecessor) has treated any individual holding a substantially similar position as an employee for purposes of employment taxes for any period beginning after December 31, 1977.
Section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978, P.L. 95-600, § 530, 92 Stat. 2763 (1978), reprinted in 1978 USCCAN 2.[3] Thus, § 530 is essentially a defense to an otherwise valid claim against a taxpayer who has failed to pay employment taxes because he has treated employees as independent contractors. See Murphy v. United States, No. 93-C-156-S, 1993 WL 559362, at *2 (W.D.Wis. October 22, 1993). "Accordingly, the party claiming § 530 protection has the burden to show entitlement to [such] protection." Id.
As made clear by the plain language of § 530, a taxpayer qualifies for relief under § 530 only if the taxpayer can show that: (1) the taxpayer has not treated any individual as an employee who holds a substantially similar position as those classified as independent contractors (the substantial consistency requirement); (2) the taxpayer has filed all required federal tax returns on a basis consistent with the taxpayer's treatment of an individual as an independent contractor (the reporting consistency requirement); and (3) the taxpayer had a reasonable basis for treating the individual as an independent contractor. See, e.g., Henry v. United States, 793 F.2d 289, 291 (Fed.Cir.1986); Henderson v. United States, No. 90-1064, 1992 WL 104326, at *3 (W.D.Mich. February 18, 1992); Murphy, supra, at *2. As one Court has stated, the "keys to gaining access to the [protection of § 530] are found, first, in the consistent treatment of all similarly situated individuals, and second ..., [on] accurate, complete filing of all required tax forms." Erickson v. Commissioner, 172 B.R. 900, 912-13 (D.Minn.1994).


*176 B. Application of § 530 to the instant case

In this case, however, the Court finds that the evidence of record demonstrates that plaintiff cannot meet the requirements of § 530 set forth above. More specifically, the record demonstrates that plaintiff did not treat all individuals who held similar positions as independent contractors, failing § 530's "substantial consistency requirement." Indeed, plaintiff treated his only driver, Halfhill, as an employee in 1978 and 1979, but from 1982 through 1990, plaintiff treated all the individuals who drove HT's trucks, including Halfhill, as independent contractors. The type of work performed by Halfhill in the 1970's, however, was substantially similar to the work performed by all of the drivers in the 1980's; these individuals drove HT's trucks, negotiated with carriers regarding the leasing of HT's vehicles, and were paid a percentage of what HT's trucks actually earned. Thus, because plaintiff has inconsistently labeled individuals who performed similar job functions, he is not entitled to § 530's shelter. See also Lowen Corp. v. United States, 785 F.Supp. 913, 915-16 (D.Kansas 1992); Erickson, 172 B.R. at 913; Nash v. United States, No. 93-5877, 1995 WL 655588, at *1 (E.D.Pa. November 7, 1995) (all holding that inconsistent treatment of workers precludes relief under § 530).[4]
Contrary to the Court's findings, plaintiff has argued that there are material issues of fact in dispute with regard to whether plaintiff has satisfied § 530's consistency requirements. More specifically, plaintiff contends that the evidence indicates that plaintiff actually started a new business in 1982, borrowing the name of his first business. Therefore, plaintiff argues that the fact that he treated Halfhill as an employee in 1978 and 1979 is irrelevant and because he treated all of his drivers consistently for the period that his new business was in operation  1982 through 1990  he is entitled to protection under § 530.
The Court, however, finds plaintiff's arguments to be unpersuasive for the following reasons. First, the provisions of § 530 look to whether a "taxpayer" or a "taxpayer's predecessor" has treated workers consistently, not to the actions of a particular business. In this case, plaintiff cannot dispute that he was the same taxpayer from 1978 through 1990.[5] In fact, plaintiff used the same employer identification number on his IRS filings throughout this period. Moreover, a reasonable factfinder could not conclude, based on the record before the Court, that plaintiff ever started a "new" business. Although plaintiff indicated in his deposition that he did so, when questioned more thoroughly, plaintiff stated that he believed he started a new business simply because of the way he treated his drivers for tax purposes. (See defendant's Exhibit A-1, pp. 167-68). This testimony, coupled with the alleged "new" business' same name, function, and ownership as the alleged "old" business, demonstrate that plaintiff did not, in fact, start a different company. Finally, even if plaintiff had started another business, the evidence indicates that the first business was a predecessor of the second business, and the consistency requirements would, therefore, apply to the period that both businesses were in operation, i.e., 1978 through the present.
In sum, the Court finds that defendant is entitled to summary judgment with regard to plaintiff's claim to relief under § 530 because the plaintiff cannot satisfy § 530's substantial consistency requirement. Therefore, the Court will grant the defendant's motion for partial summary judgment.
NOTES
[1]  The Court notes, and the defendant does not dispute, that even if the Court grants this motion, plaintiff will still be entitled to a refund if the plaintiff can demonstrate that the drivers of HT's trucks are independent contractors, not employees.
[2]  Congress has imposed social security taxes on the employer under the Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA). 26 U.S.C. § 3101, et seq. Congress has imposed unemployment insurance taxes on the employer under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA). 26 U.S.C. § 3301, et seq.; see also Hospital Resource Personnel, Inc., 68 F.3d at 424 n. 5.
[3]  Although § 530 was never codified, it is reproduced in the notes following § 3401 of the Internal Revenue Code. (See defendant's brief at p. 12, n. 7).
[4]  The Court also notes that the record demonstrates that plaintiff fails § 530's "reporting consistency requirement" because plaintiff did not file the required federal returns on a basis consistent with his treatment of Halfhill as an independent contractor. The Court need not, however, rely on this ground.
[5]  HT is a sole proprietorship operated by plaintiff and, therefore, plaintiff is the party responsible for paying taxes for this business.

                           ORDER AND JUDGMENT *


Before EBEL, HENRY, and HARTZ, Circuit Judges.


      After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined

unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of

this appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2)(c); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is

therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.

      Sergio Ortega-Guzman pleaded guilty to unlawfully reentering the United

States after deportation for an aggravated felony in violation of 8 U.S.C. §§



      *
        This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the
doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court
generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order
and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.
1326(a) and (b)(2). He appeals the district court's denial of his motion to dismiss

the indictment and raises an issue regarding his sentence. Counsel appointed to

represent defendant on appeal filed a brief pursuant to Anders v. California, 386

U.S. 738 (1967). We affirm the district court’s denial of Mr. Ortega-Guzman’s

motion to dismiss the indictment and we affirm the conviction.



                                 I. BACKGROUND

      Mr. Ortega-Guzman, a Mexican citizen, was deported by the United States

in August 2001. He had previously been convicted of an aggravated felony in

Colorado state court. He subsequently returned to the United States without

lawful permission, and, in March of 2002, he was arrested in Weld County,

Colorado, where state authorities charged him with driving without a license and

without valid insurance. Convicted of both charges, he spent ten days in jail,

after which the Immigration and Naturalization Service took him into custody.

      The federal government indicted him for violating 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a) and

(b)(2), charging that he illegally re-entered the United States after deportation and

that he did so after being convicted of an aggravated felony. Mr. Ortega-Guzman

moved to dismiss the indictment before trial, claiming that his original

deportation proceeding was tainted by a due process violation. The district court

denied the motion.


                                         -2-
      After the district court rejected this motion to dismiss the indictment, Mr.

Ortega-Guzman pleaded guilty to the charged offense. His “Rule 11 Plea

Statement,” which the parties submitted in lieu of a formal plea agreement, was

unconditional, that is, it preserved no issues for appeal. The district court

accepted Mr. Ortega-Guzman’s guilty plea, finding that it met all the

requirements set forth in Fed. R. Crim. P. 11. After the district court rejected Mr.

Ortega-Guzman’s motion for a downward departure, Mr. Ortega-Guzman was

sentenced to 57 months’ imprisonment.



                                  II. DISCUSSION

      Mr. Ortega-Guzman has asked his counsel to appeal the district court’s

denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment and to challenge the denial of the

motion for downward departure. Anders holds that if counsel finds a case to be

wholly frivolous after conscientious examination, he should so advise the court

and request permission to withdraw. Counsel must in addition submit to both the

court and his client a brief referring to anything in the record arguably supportive

of the appeal. The client may then raise any points he chooses, and the appellate

court thereafter undertakes a complete examination of all proceedings and decides

whether the appeal is in fact frivolous. If it so finds, it may grant counsel’s

request to withdraw and dismiss the appeal. See Anders, 386 U.S. at 744.



                                          -3-
      Mr. Ortega-Guzman Defendant was notified of his right to file a pro se

brief, and he has chosen not to do so. Accordingly, we turn to an examination of

the proceedings below to determine if the appeal is wholly frivolous.

      In his Anders brief, counsel first dismisses the possibility that the district

court erred in denying the motion to dismiss the indictment. As noted above,

however, Mr. Ortega-Guzman’s plea agreement preserved no issues for appeal.

See United States v. Ryan, 894 F.2d 355, 360-61 (10th Cir. 1990) (Rule 11

requires a defendant to reserve the specific issue to be appealed). In the absence

of a conditional plea, a defendant who pleads guilty admits to all of the factual

allegations contained in the indictment and the legal consequences of those acts.

See United States v. Broce, 488 U.S. 563, 569-70 (1989); see also Tollett v.

Henderson, 411 U.S. 258, 267 (1973) (“When a criminal defendant has solemnly

admitted in open court that he is in fact guilty of the offense with which he is

charged, he may not thereafter raise independent claims relating to the deprivation

of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea. He may

only attack the voluntary and intelligent character of the guilty plea.”). Mr.

Ortega-Guzman does not challenge the “voluntary and intelligent character” of his

guilty plea. See id., 411 U.S. at 267. Consequently, Mr. Ortega-Guzman has no

basis for collaterally attacking his deportation proceeding.




                                          -4-
      Next, Mr. Ortega-Guzman challenges the district court’s failure to grant

him a downward departure. In so doing, the court clearly recognized that it had

the discretion to depart downward but declined to do so. Because the court

acknowledged its authority to grant such a departure, we have no jurisdiction to

review its decision refusing to exercise that authority. See United States v.

Castillo, 140 F.3d 874, 889 (10th Cir. 1998).

      We have carefully examined the record to ascertain whether any other

ground exists to support a challenge to defendant's sentence. We find nothing in

the record to indicate that the sentence imposed was in violation of the law or the

result of a misapplication of the sentencing guidelines. Accordingly, we are

without jurisdiction to consider such a challenge. See United States v. Sanchez,

146 F.3d 796, 796-97 (10th Cir. 1998); 18 U.S.C. § 3742(a).



                                III. CONCLUSION

      Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court denying Mr.

Ortega-Guzman’s motion to dismiss the indictment, we AFFIRM the conviction,

and we GRANT counsel’s motion to withdraw.

                                                Entered for the Court,

374 So.2d 929 (1979)
Richard GRAHAM
v.
STATE.
4 Div. 685.
Court of Criminal Appeals of Alabama.
March 27, 1979.
Rehearing Denied April 17, 1979.
*930 David C. Emery, Ozark, for appellant.
William J. Baxley, Atty. Gen., and Edwin L. Yates, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the State, appellee.
LEIGH M. CLARK, Retired Circuit Judge.
Appellant was indicted for murder in the first degree of "Donna M. Wilcynski, by stabbing her with a knife or other sharp instrument." A jury found him guilty of murder in the first degree as charged and fixed his punishment at life imprisonment. He was sentenced accordingly.
Appellant submits as the only issue on appeal:
"Whether or not sufficient evidence was presented to sustain the verdict of first degree murder."
We have no doubt that there was bountiful evidence that the alleged victim was brutally slain, in the manner charged in the indictment, by some fiend, and that the homicide was murder in the first degree. The only controverted issue on the trial was whether defendant-appellant committed the homicide.
The record indicates, and almost conclusively shows, that there was no eyewitness to the homicide other than the victim and her murderer(s); that they were the only persons in the apartment of the victim at Byrd Apartments, Ozark, when she was killed, between 11:00 P.M. and midnight on April 11, 1978. Her death resulted from multiple stab wounds in various parts of her body, from front to back and from head to feet. They were so extensive and numerous that the physician who examined her body was unable to number them. He grouped them in a description of them in his testimony as shown by six complete pages of the record. That she was dead before or immediately after the completion of the stabbing of her, there can hardly be any doubt. Her body was not discovered until late in the afternoon on April 12, 1978, after neighboring apartment dwellers had become concerned about her, one of them noting that her automobile was at its accustomed place at the apartment, that she was nowhere to be seen, that her apartment was locked and that efforts to get her to the door were futile. One of them called an officer and soon thereafter a number of them arrived.
Upon arrival of the officers, a master key was obtained, and thereby her apartment was entered by one of the officers, who found her body in the bathtub. He promptly secured the scene and sent for an investigator of the Police Department of Ozark, *931 who soon arrived; he looked at the body in the bathtub, and then observed a three-year-old child in the bedroom of the apartment. He then called the coroner and personnel from the crime laboratory and secured the building for a thorough and accurate on-the-premises criminal investigation by experienced personnel, which was assiduously performed, continuing for about two hours at the scene. Blood samples were obtained, latent fingerprints were lifted, numerous photographs were taken, samples of hair were gathered from the apartment and other physical items of evidence were taken into custody.
The victim's body in the bathtub was lying on its back. All but the face was covered with sheets and other coverings from her bed. Upon removal of the bed coverings, her body was completely nude. There was no water in the bathtub; the drain thereof was closed. The floor of the bathroom was dry, but the carpet or rug in the hall was soaked with water, and the carpet or rugs in the victim's bedroom and in the child's bedroom were wet. A test made by an officer showed that water from the overflowing bathtub would run into portions of the floor of the apartment that were wet.
Bloodstains were found at several places in the apartment, including the mattress and the box springs of victim's bed, the floor, walls, curtains, and on the outside handle of the door to the apartment.
The furniture in the bedroom appeared to be ransacked. The living room appeared to be normal. There were pry marks on the outside of a window to the apartment.
The evidence, consisting of the testimony of twenty-seven witnesses and numerous exhibits, is almost, if not entirely, free of substantial conflict. Witnesses for the State may be grouped:
(1) Those testifying as to conduct of defendant while at Byrd Apartments on Sunday, April 9, 1978,
(2) Those testifying as to his conduct at Byrd Apartments the night of the murder, April 11, 1978,
(3) A few who heard noises in the victim's apartment between 11:00 P.M. and midnight, April 11,
(4) Expert and lay witnesses as to the condition and contents of the victim's apartment at the time her body was discovered therein in the late afternoon of April 12,
(5) Witnesses, chiefly expert witnesses, as to (a) the condition of the corpse, (b) fingerprints, (c) samples of blood found in the victim's apartment, (d) samples of hair from victim's apartment, (e) what was revealed by a search of defendant and his home, (f) statements made by defendant after the murder and (g) what was found in defendant's automobile that he was driving the night of the murder.
Evidence on behalf of defendant consisted of defendant's own testimony as to his conduct on Sunday, April 9, and on the night of the murder and the testimony of his wife, which pertained chiefly to his conduct prior to his going to the Byrd Apartments on April 11 and his return to their home after midnight of the night of the murder.
Some of the witnesses for the State who testified as to the presence and conduct of defendant at the Byrd Apartments on Sunday, April 9, 1978, said they saw him at the courtyard with his young son Sunday morning; that there was a "cookout" party that afternoon and that defendant and his son and the victim and her daughter, the child who was in the victim's apartment the night of the murder, were at the party; that defendant played with Mrs. Wilcynski's child, and inquired of some at the party as to Mrs. Wilcynski. There was some evidence that he attempted to converse with Mrs. Wilcynski but that she did not talk with him. Captain William Dortch, of the United States Army, a friend of appellant (a warrant officer of the Army) had an apartment at the Byrd Apartments. Defendant was visiting Captain Dortch on Sunday, April 9.
According to defendant's testimony, he was invited by Captain Dortch to stay for the cookout late that afternoon.
*932 Appellant returned to the apartment complex on the evening of April 11. As much of the testimony is merely cumulative as to undisputed facts, no attempt will be made to particularize the testimony of all of the individual witnesses or to name all of them.
Mrs. June Napier, who had seen appellant in the courtyard on Sunday afternoon, testified also that as she was unloading groceries from her automobile on the night of the murder, appellant approached her, picked up a bag of groceries and stated that he would help her take them up the stairs. She said,
"I told him that was all right, that I could get them and he said, `Well, I understand how it is. It's awful hard to raise children alone, isn't it?' and I told him that I wasn't alone.
". . .
"I took the groceries in the house and he just came in with a sack of groceries and put them down and
". . .
"He was talking to me and I can't remember what he was saying, because I was in a hurry and trying to get dinner ready before Vincent [her husband] came home. I was a few minutes late, and my little girl cut her finger. She just came out of the bathroom, and I hadn't put up Vincent's things, and she got a razor blade and cut her finger with it, and he picked her up and took her in the bathroom and fixed it up. Then he was just talking to her and I was putting away my groceries and stuff, and a while later Vincent came in."
Mrs. Napier further testified that while defendant was in the apartment and before her husband returned, she was going "back and forth getting things out of the car and trying to get dinner ready" and that she noticed defendant drinking a bottle of beer. She said that when her husband arrived, a friend, Jeff Parker, was with him and that defendant remained at the apartment and sat down and talked with Mr. Napier and Jeff Parker. She did not stay with the three men but went into the bedroom.
While the door of the bedroom was closed, she heard her husband say, "Don't go in there, because my wife is nursing the baby," and when she heard him say that she "just pulled my blouse down and laid the baby down, and he came in there and put his arm around me, and he said, `Which way is the bathroom.'" She then left the bedroom and went into the room where her husband was, and she assumed defendant went into the bathroom, which other evidence shows that he did.
According to additional testimony of Mrs. Napier, she was not certain as to the time defendant left the apartment of the Napiers'. She remembered that he was still there at 10:00 o'clock, and that she had gone downstairs to get some clothes out of the drier and when she returned he had gone. She said he must have gone "around 10:45, or something like that" or that it "must have been about 10:30." She said that "about a quarter to eleven," while she was returning from her automobile with some clothes of her husband to be washed, and was going up the stairs to the floor of her apartment, she saw defendant near the stairwell across from Mrs. Wilcynski's apartment. While at or near the stairwell he said to Mrs. Napier:
"What hours does your husband work? When can I see you again? What is your phone number?"
Instead of replying to defendant, Mrs. Napier said that she just "went on up the stairs," that "I didn't say anything to him, it scared me." She saw him no more that night.
Mr. Vincent Napier testified that as he returned to the apartment that night, accompanied by Jeff Parker, he saw defendant sitting at the table in the dining room with a beer; he walked past defendant, went to the kitchen and talked with his wife and returned and introduced himself to the defendant. They sat and talked, and Napier and Parker and defendant played dominoes. Mrs. Napier had gone into the back bedroom where the baby was; the defendant went toward the bathroom, and he told defendant to knock on the door, that *933 his wife might be nursing the baby; after two or three minutes defendant came back to the table where they were playing dominoes. He said that about nine o'clock, defendant went for a can opener and returned in about five minutes, that defendant left "around eleven ... maybe a little before or after." His wife returned to the apartment from her trip downstairs to the automobile, shortly after the defendant left.
Captain Bill Dortch testified that he lived on the same floor of the apartment as Mrs. Wilcynski and about three or four apartments from her. He had known defendant in connection with their military work. He had not lived at the Byrd Apartments long. He lived alone. Defendant had visited him the Sunday before the murder and had helped him move to the apartment. On the day of the murder, defendant came to the apartment at about 5:30 P.M. Dortch owned a motorcycle that he "used to store... right under the stairwell." Defendant left Dortch's apartment "around 7:30 or 8:00." He was going to get something to eat, some hamburgers for both of them; he returned "between 8:30 and 9:00" but only stayed a few minutes. Further testimony was as follows:
"Q He came back to your apartment at what time?
"A He came backyou mean after the second time?
"Q Right.
"A That was 10:30, because I was laying on the couch waiting for him to bring the food, and when the door opened I got up.
"Q Is there any special reason that you know it was 10:30?
"A Yeah, because I was lying on the couch and I was expecting hamburgers, and I checked my watch, and I said, `Well, it is kind of late to worry about the hamburgers.'
"Q When he came back at 10:30 what did you and he do?
"A Well, just discussed what he was doing and why he didn't have the hamburgers.
"Q Okay, did youhow many drinks had you had that night?
"A MaybeI would say about two drinks that night, because I wasn't feeling good. That's why I was lying on the couch.
"Q Okay, and you say that Mr. Graham left your apartment some time between 12:00 and 12:30, is this correct?
"A That is correct.
"Q But you are not sure of the time between 12:00 and 12:30?
"A That is correct.
"Q Is there any special way that you could point down that he left your apartment between 12:00 and 12:30?
"A Well, the reason why I say between 12:00 and 12:30 is because after he left, I went in the ice box and got something to eat, and thensee my door was still unlocked, because I didn't walk with him to the door. He just closed the door himself, and after I finished eating, then I went and locked the door and checked the time and it was 12:35. I know it didn't take that long for me to go right to the refrigerator."
At one time during the testimony of Captain Dortch, he said:
"Q Did you go to sleep during the time that he was there and the time he
"A Yeah, I was sleeping part of the time."
Clyde Hamilton, Jr., seven years old, testified that on the night of the murder, while he was looking for his frisbee in the apartment house hallway, he saw defendant come out of an apartment at the same time that Mrs. Wilcynski came out of her apartment and defendant "went up to her and started talking to her, but then when he went up, I left." He didn't know the time that this occurred, but stated it was after dark. Clyde's father testified that Clyde, Jr., was out of the apartment looking for his frisbee from "almost exactly 8:30 by my watch" and came back in about fifteen or twenty minutes with his frisbee. He had previously seen defendant at Byrd Apartments, once at the cookout on April 9 and again in between "7:10 and 7:30" when *934 defendant was "withI don't know the man's name but he was a captain and he lived in apartment 15; a black man, and they were outside, on the sidewalk and I spoke to them as I went by."
John McGraw, who lived in apartment No. 9 next door to Mrs. Wilcynski's apartment, testified that as he returned to his apartment from work "about 10:30" he saw defendant standing in front of the victim's door next to the stairwell talking to some lady. He said the lady was going up the stairs; that defendant asked the lady if she would like to go to "a party or park" but that the lady said "something like, `I will have to ask my husband'"; that the lady went up the stairs.
There were three witnesses as to noises in the victim's apartment on the night of the murder: (a) Mrs. Rose Teich testified that between 11:00 and 11:30 she heard Mrs. Wilcynski scream, a short, sharp scream. She said she screamed about four or five times; that her husband went downstairs to investigate and returned saying "I can't see anything." (b) John Hamby, who also lived in an apartment next to the victim's, testified that about "11:40 or 11:41" he heard noise, a banging, in her apartment, and he thought "somebody was taking a shower in the apartment." (c) A stipulation between the parties was agreed upon and admitted in evidence as the sworn testimony of William Tharp, that "about 11:35 or 11:37" when he returned to his apartment the night of the murder he heard "a long lingering scream next door, then it got quiet."
The victim's mother testified that no jewelry was missing from the apartment after the murder.
A large number of hairs were obtained from the scene of the murder, some from the victim, some from the bed and some from other places in the apartment. Many hairs were obtained from defendant, after he was taken into custody, from various portions of his body. There were also some hairs taken from defendant's dog. State Toxicologist John Kilborn examined the hairs taken from the apartment and the hairs obtained from the head and other areas of defendant and compared the two groups of hairs. He testified in part as follows:
"Q Will you tell the jury the similarities that you found from the known hairs from Richard Graham's head and from the scene; step by step, the things that were identical.
"A Well, out of all the 286 hairs I found, there were 3 that can be identified as Negroid hairs. Two of these are very small and really considered too small to make any type of comparison; only identified the race. The third hair which was submitted, contained in a plastic bag, labeled `from the top sheet,' this hair was compared with the hair of Mr. Graham, found that all of these characteristics were identical. We found that there was a medium type cuticle with ragged scale pattern, and the diameter was identical and the variation in diameter was very little, it was identical between the known and the unknown, the pigmentation of the hairthere extreme clumping of the pigment granules and these granules were located on the edge of the hair. The medulla was absent. There was no evidence of artificial treatment, like dying or bleaching. On the cross section, both hairs were extremely flat, and the pigmentation was identical. In the hair received from the scene, or submitted to me as identified from the scene, hair was not a complete hair, it was a broken hair. There was no root to examine, and the tipthe tip was indeed present, it was very frayed, and I couldn't ascertain whether or not the tip was present.
"Q Then your conclusion of comparison is what?
"A That microscopically the hair identified to me from the top sheet is identical to that of Mr. Graham's head hair."
On cross-examination of Mr. Kilborn he testified that hair can be transferred from person to person and as to the possibility thereof without any physical contact. The latter part of his testimony on cross-examination was as follows:

*935 "Q Johnny, if on 9 April, 1978, Rick Graham had been playing with the child of Donna Wilkinski, is it possible that a hair from his head was transferred to the child, who in turn, transferred it to that apartment?
"A Well, without actual knowledge of the circumstances it would be difficult for me to say. I would once again say that hairs can be transferred.
"Q Johnny, is it possible that this hair came from another individual other than Rick Graham?
"A Yes, sir, this is possible."
M. R. Nowicki testified that he was with defendant on the day before defendant was arrested, which other evidence shows was approximately one week after the murder, at the office of the Ft. Rucker preschool, that they discussed some matters at the preschool with reference to the work there and in the course of the conversation, the witness asked defendant to call him thereafter and defendant then asked for the phone number of the witness. His testimony continued as follows:
"I gave it to him, and he said, `Where is that?', and I said, `It's at the Headquarters Building,' and he said, `Oh, you are up there now?', and I said, `Yes.' He went on to say, `I suppose you have heard my name mentioned up there lately?', I said in a kidding manner, `No more than usual, what did you do this time?' I had not heard anything prior to that time. He said to me, `Well, I am the number one suspect in a murder case in Ozark.'
. . .
"A He further said to me, `I was there.' He paused and he said, `I was at her apartment that night.'"
State Toxicologist Chap McCracken, Jr., who performed an autopsy on the body of Mrs. Wilcynski and testified extensively as to his examination of her body and the scene of the murder, testified also that in the process of the investigation of the murder he examined the automobile that defendant had purportedly driven the night of the murder. As to this, his testimony was in part as follows:
"Q Did you find any bloodstains in Richard Graham's automobile?
"A Yes, I did.
"Q And where did you find them?
"A I found two small red-brown stains on the steering wheel of the automobile. They gave a positive presumptive test for the presence of blood, and small sizes of stains precluded more specific examination.
"Q Could you tell the age of that?
"A They were relatively fresh.
"Q What?
"A Relatively fresh, not ancient.
"Q Did you find any more blood in there?
"A No, sir."
By the testimony of State's witnesses, it was shown that the initial investigators of the crime found a "partial shoe print" on the carpet of the apartment of the victim. The section of the carpet with the partial shoe print was removed and admitted in evidence. As to it, Mr. Dale Carter, a criminalist and director of the Enterprise Laboratory of the Alabama Department of Toxicology and Criminal Investigation, testified:
"A It's a piece of carpet with a partial footprintreddish stained footprint on it.
"Q And do the reddish stains show positive presumptive tests for blood?
"A Yes, sir.
"Q And where did you extract that piece of carpet?
"A It was identified as being from the living room by the wall of the outside window.
"Q Now, on this piece of carpet, did you measure the size of the partial shoe print?
"A Yes, sir, I did as best I could.
"Q Okay.
"A Three and a half inches at the widest and eight and a half at the longest.
". . . .
"Q Now, in your opinion, was this print made by a tennis shoe?
"A In my opinion, this print was made by a shoe having a smooth sole and heel with no pattern.

*936 "Q So then you would further state in your opinion that this print was not made by a tennis shoe?
"A I can't state that because I have seen smooth bottom tennis shoes, even though they are not common. I myself own a pair."
When State Toxicologist McCracken was asked on cross-examination whether the shoe print in the carpet was made by a tennis shoe, he replied, "If it were a flat soled tennis shoe, it could have. They are not common, but they are not uncommon." When asked whether it matched any of the shoes in the apartment occupied by the victim, he said, "I did not see anything it matched."
Mrs. Graham, wife of defendant, testified that her husband came home "around one o'clock" the night of the murder. He ate something and went to bed. She said he had on "a white sweat shirt, a blue jeans, and sneakers" or tennis shoes. She did not wash any of the clothes prior to the time the search warrant was executed; "his blue jeans were still on the bar where he left it at, I did not wash it."; his shirt and his socks were sitting on the table when the search was commenced. She said that one of the officers looked at the same pants he had on the night of the murder. She said that the officers executing the search warrant went "through all of his shoes and all of his clothes and everything." According to her testimony, defendant had not worn the pants introduced in evidence, upon which there was testimony as to blood, in a "long time," that the pants were in a small box sitting in the corner in the kitchen on the floor, when the officers found them, that they were with a bunch of old clothes that she had taken to a garage sale to try to sell and had brought back home. Her husband was not wearing the pants the night of the murder. On the day before the search was made, her husband was in the kitchen cutting a cake and cut his finger. She told him to put a bandage on his finger, but he said, "It will heal faster if you don't put something on it." On cross-examination, she said she did not know whether her husband washed the shirt he wore the night of the murder between that time and the day of the search.
According to the testimony of defendant, he and his son spent most of Sunday morning and afternoon at the Byrd Apartments, where he went to visit Captain Dortch, who asked him to stay over for the cookout. Except in the respect that he claimed that he was not as immodest and extrovertive in his behaviour as some of the testimony for the State indicated, there was no substantial conflict between his testimony and that of witnesses for the State. He said that his son, Christopher, played with "Therese," the victim's daughter. After some time he went outside and played with them and other children. He gave them "pony rides on my knee." He said, "I had my son sitting on one lap and had "Teresa" over here to get her up on the other leg and give them a ride. She didn't want to get up at one time, so I didn't force her." Mrs. Wilcynsky came out and brought some cold drinks for all the children. He had a conversation with Mrs. Wilcynski and asked one of the men he knew about her. He said he left the apartments about 5:00 P.M., which was earlier than some of the witnesses for the State said he left.
According to the testimony of defendant, he arrived at Captain Dortch's apartment about 5:20 or 5:25 P.M. April 11. They sat around and talked until between 7:30 and 8:00. He had had a drink with Captain Dortch. Captain Dortch suggested at that time that defendant get them something to eat. As he went out of the apartment, he saw Mrs. Napier's daughter, Emily, and was having a conversation with her, when he saw Mrs. Napier arrive. He went into detail as to his conversation with Mrs. Napier. He started up the stairs with the bag of groceries and went with her and Emily into the apartment. There was little difference between his testimony and the testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Napier as to what happened at the apartment of the Napiers. He left about 9:00 P.M. to go to Captain Dortch's apartment to get a can opener, and as he left Captain Dortch's apartment with the *937 can opener, he saw Mrs. Wilcynski at the stairwell next to her apartment. He mentioned to her about the good time that his son had had playing with Mrs. Wilcynski's daughter the preceding Sunday. He said he did not go into Mrs. Wilcynski's apartment but went directly back to the apartment of the Napiers. He left that apartment again "shortly after 10:00." While going to Captain Dortch's apartment, he saw Mrs. Napier coming into the apartment building near the stairwell next to Mrs. Wilcynski's apartment and had conversation with her for a few moments and went to Captain Dortch's apartment and stayed there until "about 12:30." There was little difference between the testimony of defendant and that of Mr. Nowicki as to the conversation between the two. The defendant knew at that time that he was a suspect; his house had been searched and he had heard his name called in connection with the murder. The chief difference in his testimony and that of Mr. Nowicki was that defendant said that he had been at the "apartments where she lived on that night," instead of "at her apartment."
According to further testimony of defendant, he wears a "size 10 or 10 ½" shoe. The shoes he had on at trial were eleven and five-eights inches long and four inches wide on the outside. On the night of the murder he had on a white sweat shirt, with the emblem "U. S. Army Aviation School" on it, a pair of athletic shorts with a similar emblem on the corner in white print and a pair of black and white sneakers, or "tennis shoes, or gym shoes, or whatever you call them." He exhibited to the jury his finger that he said he cut with a knife on Thursday morning after the murder. He did not put a bandaid on it right away but did after he saw that it wasn't going to stay closed. When the officers came out and searched his house they looked at about everything there, about all his clothes, "at least one of every pair of my shoes," took them out to the driveway and examined them and then started "bringing it back in one by one after they were satisfied with it, until they finally got to that light pair of pants that they found in the kitchen." They had obtained the pants from a box in the kitchen with a bunch of old clothes. His testimony as to them was substantially the same as that of his wife. He had not worn the particular pants, according to his recollection, since about six months or a year prior to the murder.
Defendant moved for an exclusion of the evidence at the end of State's evidence, requested in writing and was refused the general affirmative charge in the defendant's favor at the conclusion of all the evidence, and filed a motion for a new trial, which the trial court overruled. There seems to be little difference of view between the parties as to the applicable principles to be applied as to the sufficiency of the evidence to justify denial of a motion to exclude the evidence, the refusal of the general affirmative charge requested in writing, or the denial of a motion for a new trial presenting an issue as to the sufficiency or weight of the evidence. The difference between them is as to the application of those principles to the evidence in this case, each arguing for his [its] side of the issue, without reference to any precedent in which the evidence was similar or the circumstances comparable.
In most cases in which there is a serious dispute as to the sufficiency of the evidence to support a guilty verdict, there is a sharp conflict in the evidence as to material facts, some of the witnesses swearing one way and others another. In such cases, the task of an appellate court is generally easier than otherwise, for it can then lean more comfortably upon the responsibility of the trial court, as well as the trial jury, both of whom are in a better position to determine which witnesses have testified truthfully and which falsely. We do not have such a situation in the instant case, in which there is little, if any, material conflict in the evidence.
On the question of the guilt or innocence of defendant of the crime charged, the evidence against him is entirely circumstantial; the evidence in his favor is both direct and circumstantial. It is a mistake, a common one, to denigrate the nature of circumstantial *938 evidence by considering it as inferior to direct evidence. That fallacy has been denounced, with the clarity of a clarion, by some of the greatest judicial minds of Alabama, state and federal, speaking from a wealth of wisdom and experience. Included, in the sequence of their statements, are Judge Seybourn H. Lynne, in United States v. Bostwick, N.D.Ala. (on appeal at 5 Cir., 218 F.2d 790); the late Judge Aubrey M. Cates, Jr., in Sumeral v. State, 39 Ala.App. 638, 106 So.2d 270; Judge J. Russell McElroy, as now found in the third edition of his treatise on Alabama evidence, Gamble, McElroy's Alabama Evidence, § 212.01, and Judge John O. Harris, now our Presiding Judge, in Creel v. State, 53 Ala.App. 504, 301 So.2d 267, and subsequent cases.
In comparing the relative strength of circumstantial and direct evidence and in declining to give preference to either, the reference is to the two kinds of evidence in general. It is axiomatic that in some cases the direct evidence may be stronger than the circumstantial evidence therein and in other cases the circumstantial evidence may be stronger than the direct evidence therein. At times, where there are both kinds of evidence that are irreconcilable and lead to opposite determinations as to the truth that is proved by the evidence taken as a whole, either direct evidence or circumstantial evidence may prevail over the other. To say that each "is entitled to the same weight" as the other is not to say that in every case each has the same weight as the other. It can be readily seen that circumstantial evidence can be more credible than direct evidence, for circumstances, when shown to be true, are disinterested and unbiased, while direct evidence must come from witnesses who are often either interested or biased, or both, or for other innate human weakness are unreliable in purportedly stating what they have seen or heard. Circumstantial evidence is often strong enough to so discredit direct evidence as to show that the direct evidence is not true, whether intentionally or mistakenly untrue. But if there is true direct evidence, such as truthful testimony of a witness that he, in fact, saw a person commit a crime, such testimony is not vitiated by circumstantial evidence, however unquestionably true it is and however strong it may be to the contrary. To conclude otherwise is to defy the principle that truth is never inconsistent with truth.
The foregoing considerations lead us to special consideration of direct evidence in the case that is in conflict with strong circumstantial evidence of defendant's guilt. We should, and we do, in our general consideration of the evidence, include the direct evidence of defendant that is diametrically opposed to a conclusion of guilt, but for the special consideration of this time we refer particularly to the testimony of one of the witnesses for the State, Captain Bill Dortch.
In its argument in its brief on appeal as to the testimony of Captain Dortch, appellee states:
"Bill Dortch stated that Appellant returned to his apartment at approximately 10:30 p. m. and stayed until 12:00 or 12:30 a. m. Dortch also testified that he was sleeping during part of this time. Appellant, in his brief, maintains that this testimony established his alibi. This testimony, however, was contradicted by Mrs. Napier, who stated that she encountered the Appellant at 11:00 p. m. while she was returning from her car...."
Although Dortch's answer to one question asked him on direct examination could understandably lead to the conclusion reached in the second sentence of the above quoted statement in appellee's brief, such conclusion is shown to be incorrect by a consideration of his testimony as a whole. By this it is not meant that there was any conflict in his testimony, merely that an answer of the witness, when considered in connection with the question asked him, was ambiguous, which ambiguity was clarified by other testimony of the witness. We have hereinabove set forth the particular question and answer and now repeat it:
"Q Did you go to sleep during the time that he was there and the time he
"A Yeah, I was sleeping part of the time." *939 It is to be observed that the witness by his answer interrupted counsel before he had completed the question. The witness obviously jumped at his conclusion as to what was meant by the question, which conceivably could be reasonably interpreted as appellee has done, but for other testimony that leads to a different conclusion:
"Q Okay, did Mr. Graham, between 10:30 and whatever time he left, did he leave at any time when he was in your apartment?
"A No.
"Q Were you and him carrying on a conversation the whole time?
"A Yes, sir.
"Q Were you looking at him this whole time?
"A He was physically there.
"Q And you were not asleep any of this time between 10:30 and 12:00?
"A When he came in the door, he woke me up.
"Q Between 10:30 and the time he left your apartment; you testified to between 12:00 and 12:30, not leave your apartment between 12:00 and 12:30.
"A That's correct."
The weakness of alibi testimony generally has been perennially considered. In many, if not most, cases there was such uncertainty or vagueness about the time of the crime or the time of the presence of defendant at another place that it could reasonably be said that he could have been at the place of the crime at the time of its commission. In many of the cases witnesses testifying as to an alibi were closely related to defendant and their interest in the outcome tended to discredit them. In almost all of such cases, the witnesses were not witnesses called by the State.
The fact that Captain Dortch was called by the State as a witness does not in and of itself make his testimony any more credible than if he had been called by defendant, but it is a factor to be considered, along with all the other evidence and the respective contentions of the parties. It is to be seen that appellant's argument to the discredit of his alibi testimony is not correctly premised. Different from most cases in which an alibi is claimed and supported by considerable evidence, it seems to us that we are here faced with the positive testimony of a witness which, if true, establishes the presence of defendant at an apartment different from the one in which the murder was committed at the same time the murder was committed, and that fact would establish his innocence. It seems to us that the most reasonable conclusion to reach from the testimony of Captain Dortch is that defendant was not in the apartment of the victim of the murder at the time she was killed and, therefore, he did not kill her, or that Captain Dortch knowingly testified falsely. Whatever our individual thoughts may be on the subject, the record in and of itself, to which alone we can look, does not support the latter alternative. We view his evidence as strongly in favor of defendant on the merits of the case. There is nothing in the evidence or in the briefs of parties to lead us otherwise. We would not be justified in looking elsewhere for an answer.
One of the grounds of the motion for a new trial referred to the evidence as to part of a hair from the bed of the victim that expert testimony showed had the same physical qualities and characteristics as hair from defendant's head. The Court in its order overruling defendant's motion for a new trial said:
"The Court will take judicial notice of the scientific fact that a positive identification cannot be made by comparing a hair sample of an unknown origin with a hair sample of known origin. However, hair does possess a unique series of characteristics and a disputed hair can be compared for similarities with other human hair whose origin is known. Therefore, the Court finds that it was competent for the State Toxicologist, who was familiar with and an expert on the properties of human hair, to testify as to his analysis of the hair found at the scene of the crime and the hair taken from the body and head of the defendant."
Though there was some value to the State in the testimony as to the resemblance of a *940 piece of hair taken from the bed of the victim and hair from defendant's head, it seems that it is not questioned that "positive identification" of defendant was not made by that comparison. It seems to us that neither side gained much by such testimony, even though each side gained some. The gain for the State is emphasized by the State's insistence as to the amount of its value as evidence. On the other hand, there is something to be said for the fact that out of the large number of hairs that were taken from the scene of the crime, there was only one piece of a hair tested that resembled defendant's hair and that only three hairs were Negroid. Moreover, the presence of a piece of defendant's hair in the bed of the victim is not irreconcilable with his claimed innocence, when due consideration is given to the undisputed evidence that defendant had played with the victim's three-year-old child two days before the murder.
The evidence as to small stains on the steering wheel of defendant's automobile a few days after the murder that "gave a positive presumptive test for the presence of blood" is heavily relied upon by appellee, as it doubtless was on the trial. The toxicologist said that the "small sizes of stains precluded more specific examination," that the stains were relatively fresh. Whether fresher than the blood of the victim murdered two days before, there is no evidence.
Appellee also refers to the blood upon a leg of appellant's pants as evidence in its favor. It is a circumstance calculated to be in favor of appellee when considered in connection with all the other evidence, but we find no answer to the position taken by appellant that the particular trousers were not the trousers that were worn by him the night of the murder. Whether true or not and whether strong or not, the evidence is undisputed that he was wearing shorts.[1] Not only did he say so, but Clyde Hamilton, Jr., when questioned about seeing defendant talking with Mrs. Wilcynski at the door of her apartment, testified:
"Q Clyde, you say you saw him talking with her there at the door, and you didn't see him go in, did you?
"A (Shaking head negatively).
"Q Did you see Donna when she came walking around the apartment?
"A No, she came out and she had short cut pantsLevis, she cut them and I didn't know where she was going.
"Q And what did this man sitting here have on, do you remember?
"A He had short blue pants, and I don't remember what kind.
"Q Do you remember his shirt? Was it a white shirt, a sweat shirt, do you know what I mean?
"A Yeah, but it wasn'tI don'tit was a short sleeve shirt, you know, what you said, but I don't know what color it was."
On the subject of the clothing worn by defendant the night of the murder, the following testimony was given by Mr. Vincent Napier, with whom defendant spent considerable time:
"Q Okay, what kind of clothes was Mr. Graham wearing that night?
"A He had a sweat shirt, and maybe jeans or something casual [which we interpret casual]. I'm not sure. He was dressed like he might have been working out or something.
"Q Okay, do you recall if he had on jeans?
"A No, I couldn't say jeans orI'm not for sure.
"Q What about his shoes?
"A No, sir.
"Q But you say you do remember he looked like he had been working out or jogging?
"A Something like that, or exercising.
"Q Those are the type of clothes he had on that night?
"A Yes, sir."
The jury was entitled to the evidence presented to it as to that which stood the presumptive test as to blood on the steering wheel and on the trousers, but in our effort *941 to determine whether the evidence is sufficient to meet the test to which it must be subjected on this appeal, it is our view that it is not strong. This in light of all the evidence but without giving much weight to the evidence as to defendant's having cut his finger as constituting the source of any blood upon his trousers.
Although the prosecution obtained an order of court requiring fingerprints of defendant that were made, there is no evidence tending to connect defendant with the crime by any of the numerous fingerprints lifted from the scene of the crime.
No effort is attempted to be made to explain the presence of the partial footprint on the carpet of the victim's apartment. To say that it was defendant's would be purely a guess. The evidence indicates, although it does not conclusively show, that it was not.
We conclude that there is much circumstantial evidence to support the verdict. A determination of its exact weight as compared with direct evidence, and some circumstantial evidence, to the contrary, may be extremely difficult, but it cannot prevail unless it is so strong that it cannot reasonably be reconciled with the theory that defendant is innocent. It is not sufficient to support a conviction if it does not exclude to a moral certainty every other reasonable hypothesis but that of the guilt of the accused. Failure to meet that test resulted in a reversal in Sumeral v. State, supra, and such test has heretofore been uniformly applied. Ellison v. State, 254 Ala. 428, 48 So.2d 176 (1950); Burgett v. State, 37 Ala.App. 469, 70 So.2d 429 (1954); Byrd v. State, 37 Ala.App. 121, 73 So.2d 376, cert. denied 261 Ala. 697, 73 So.2d 378 (1954); Whatley v. State, 37 Ala.App. 706, 75 So.2d 182 (1954); Bluth v. State, 38 Ala.App. 692, 92 So.2d 685 (1957); Smith v. State, Ala.Cr.App., 342 So.2d 422 (1977).
We would be required to say, as difficult as it may be to do so with satisfaction, whether there was sufficient evidence to warrant a refusal of the general affirmative charge in favor of defendant, if there had been no motion for a new trial raising the question of the sufficiency of the evidence. As there was such a motion for a new trial and it was overruled, we need only apply the test whether, after giving the learned trial judge the favorable presumption that is due him, the verdict is so contrary to the weight of the evidence that it is clear that it is palpably wrong or unjust. Skinner v. State, 22 Ala.App. 457, 116 So. 806 (1928); Davis v. State, 33 Ala. App. 299, 34 So.2d 15, cert. denied, 250 Ala. 240, 34 So.2d 17 (1948); Barker v. State, 55 Ala.App. 322, 315 So.2d 129, cert. denied, 294 Ala. 752, 315 So.2d 130 (1975); Smith v. State, Ala.Cr.App., 342 So.2d 422 (1977).
The test we are to apply is not whether we think that appellant is guilty. A verdict finding a defendant guilty in a criminal case is wrong and unjust, even though defendant is guilty, if the evidence of his guilt is not strong enough to meet the legal test required as stated above. Such a verdict, when properly challenged, cannot stand, even though there is strong reason to believe that if all of the true facts were known and shown in evidence guilt would be conclusively established.
After giving the trial court the favorable presumption to which it is entitled, we conclude that, irrespective of whether appellant is guilty, the verdict is so contrary to the weight of the evidence that it is clear that the verdict is palpably wrong and unjust. By so holding we do not say that there is disagreement between us and the jury as to the guilt of defendant, but that the verdict is palpably wrong and unjust by reason of the extent of its contrariety to the weight of the evidence now before us. The defendant's motion for a new trial should have been granted.
The foregoing opinion was prepared by Retired Circuit Judge LEIGH M. CLARK, serving as a judge of this Court under the provisions of § 6.10 of the New Judicial Article (Constitutional Amendment No. 328). His opinion is hereby adopted as that of the Court. The judgment of the trial court is hereby reversed and rendered.
REVERSED AND RENDERED.

DECISION AND ORDER
LARIMER, District Judge.

INTRODUCTION
Petitioner Timothy Muldrow ("Muldrow"), filed this petition pro se for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254 challenging his conviction in Monroe County Court of two counts of second degree murder. For the reasons set forth below, Muldrow's § 2254 petition is denied.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
On December 28, 1993, Muldrow participated in the execution-style murder of two people in their home. There was a third victim who survived after being shot in the face. The motivation for the killings was to silence witnesses to previous murders committed by a drug-dealing associate of Muldrow named Jerold Usher ("Usher").
Two days after the shootings, the police seized five guns and other contraband from Muldrow's apartment. Testing revealed that two of these guns fired the bullets that killed one of the victims, and bullets test-fired from a third gun were consistent with those used to shoot the other two victims.
Muldrow was indicted jointly with two of the three co-defendants, Raymond Stubbs ("Stubbs") and Anthony McGee ("McGee"), on two counts of murder in the second degree (New York Penal Law ("P.L.") §§ 125.25(1) and 20.00); two counts of felony murder (P.L. §§ 125.25(3) and 20.00); one count of attempted murder in the second degree (P.L. §§ 125.25, 110.00, and 20.00); and one count of assault (P.L. §§ 120.10 and 20.00).
Muldrow, Stubbs and Anthony were tried jointly. The fourth perpetrator, Thearthur Grimes ("Grimes"), was tried separately because he confessed to the police that he was present when the murders were committed and implicated Muldrow and McGee as the gunmen. After a jury trial in Monroe County Court, Muldrow was found guilty of two counts of felony murder and sentenced to indeterminate consecutive terms of imprisonment of 25 years to life on each count.
Muldrow appealed to the Appellate Division, Fourth Department, which unanimously affirmed his conviction on June 16, 2000. The Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal on September 20, 2000. This federal habeas corpus petition followed.

DISCUSSION
Muldrow asserts two grounds for entitlement to habeas relief, both of which stem from his appellate counsel's alleged incompetence.[1] First, Muldrow faults counsel for failing to challenge on direct appeal the purported inconsistencies in the verdicts at his trial: McGee was acquitted of all counts of the indictment, Stubbs was convicted on all counts of the indictment, and Muldrow was convicted on the felony murder counts only. Muldrow claims that each co-defendant was required to be acquitted or convicted of the same counts of the indictment in order for the verdicts to be consistent.
*169 A claim for ineffective assistance of appellate counsel is evaluated by the same standard as is a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Mayo v. Henderson, 13 F.3d 528, 533 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 820, 115 S.Ct. 81, 130 L.Ed.2d 35 (1994) (citing Claudio v. Scully, 982 F.2d 798, 803 (2d Cir.1992), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 912, 113 S.Ct. 2347, 124 L.Ed.2d 256 (1993)). A petitioner alleging ineffective assistance of appellate counsel must prove both that appellate counsel was objectively unreasonable in failing to raise a particular issue on appeal, and that absent counsel's deficient performance, there was a reasonable probability that defendant's appeal would have been successful. Mayo, 13 F.3d at 533-34; see also Smith v. Robbins, 528 U.S. 259, 285, 120 S.Ct. 746, 145 L.Ed.2d 756 (2000); Aparicio v. Artuz, 269 F.3d 78, 95 (2d Cir.2001).
Appellate counsel "need not (and should not) raise every nonfrivolous claim, but rather may select from among them in order to maximize the likelihood of success on appeal." Smith v. Robbins, 528 U.S. at 288, 120 S.Ct. 746 (citing Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.S. 745, 750-54, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987 (1983)); accord, e.g., Sellan v. Kuhlman, 261 F.3d at 317 ("This process of `winnowing out weaker arguments on appeal and focusing on' those more likely to prevail, far from being evidence of incompetence, is the hallmark of effective appellate advocacy.") (citations omitted). The habeas court should not second-guess the reasonable professional judgments of appellate counsel as to the most promising appeal issues. Jones, 463 U.S. at 754, 103 S.Ct. 3308; see also Jackson v. Leonardo, 162 F.3d 81, 85 (2d Cir.1998). Thus, a petitioner may establish constitutionally inadequate performance only by showing that appellate counsel "omitted significant and obvious issues while pursuing issues that were clearly and significantly weaker." Mayo, 13 F.3d at 533.
Muldrow's appellate counsel raised three important issues in a thorough appellate brief to the Fourth Department, crafting persuasive arguments as to why the consent to search Muldrow's apartment given by his brother was invalid and why the trial court abused its discretion in allowing David Crutcher ("Crutcher"), who suffered from schizophrenia, to testify at trial. These two issues in particular were of the utmost importance to Muldrow's case, since the ballistics evidence from the guns seized from his apartment, together with Crutcher's testimony, strongly linked him to the murder. In contrast, the repugnant verdict issue urged by Muldrow in this habeas petition was neither significant nor promising on appeal, and it was entirely reasonable for Muldrow's appellate counsel to omit it. Because Muldrow has failed to demonstrate that his appellate counsel's performance was unreasonable, he cannot meet the first prong of the standard by which ineffective assistance claims are judged.
However, even if he could establish that his appellate counsel's lawyering was deficient, Muldrow has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by the deficiency. Because Muldrow and his codefendants were indicted and charged individually for the crimes of murder, as well as in accordance with accomplice liability pursuant to P.L. § 20.00,[2] it is clear that there were, in fact, no inconsistencies in the verdicts. Respondent correctly notes that the jury had to assess the evidence against each of three defendants *170 and make a separate determination of guilt as to each. The fact that the jury convicted two defendants and acquitted a third is of no legal significance. The jury may simply have believed that the evidence was stronger against the two defendants it found guilty, and not convincing as to the defendant (McGee) who was acquitted. Thus, the issue now raised by Muldrow is not persuasive, and he cannot establish prejudice from his appellate counsel's neglect in pursuing the issue because there was no "reasonable probability" that the omitted issue would have succeeded even had it been argued on appeal. See Torres v. Irvin, 33 F.Supp.2d 257, 267 (S.D.N.Y.1998) (even if petitioner could establish that appellate counsel's advocacy was deficient, he suffered no prejudice because no "reasonable probability" that the omitted claims would have succeeded) (citing Mayo, 13 F.3d at 534); Angel v. Garvin, 2001 WL 327150 at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Apr.3, 2001) (finding that petitioner could not establish prejudice as a result of appellate counsel's failure to raise non-meritorious claim based on insufficiency of the evidence).
Moreover, an allegedly inconsistent verdict does not present a constitutional violation. Therefore, such a claim is not even cognizable on habeas review. The Supreme Court explained in United States v. Powell that
where truly inconsistent verdicts have been reached, the most that can be said ... is that the verdict shows that either in the acquittal or the conviction the jury did not speak their real conclusions, but that does not show that they were not convinced of the defendant's guilt.... It is equally possible that the jury, convinced of guilt, properly reached its conclusion ... then through mistake, compromise, or lenity, arrived at an inconsistent conclusion on the [other] offense.
469 U.S. 57, 58, 64-65, 105 S.Ct. 471, 83 L.Ed.2d 461 (1984) (internal quotations and citation omitted); see also Harris v. Rivera, 454 U.S. 339, 345, 102 S.Ct. 460, 70 L.Ed.2d 530 (1981) ("Inconsistency in a verdict is not a sufficient reason for setting it aside."); United States v. Acosta, 17 F.3d 538, 544-45 (2d Cir.1994) ("Even assuming that the verdict against Acosta was inconsistent with the verdicts as to his codefendants, we find no basis for relief, for it has long been established that inconsistency in jury verdicts of guilty on some counts and not guilty on others is not a ground for reversal of the verdicts of guilty."); Savage v. Berbary, 1991 WL 147371 at *2 (W.D.N.Y. July 22, 1991) ("Alleged inconsistencies in state court verdicts are not a proper ground for federal habeas corpus intervention...."); Billups v. Costello, 1992 WL 170650 at *4 (S.D.N.Y. July 6, 1992) ("As long as a conviction is the result of a fair trial at which legally sufficient evidence has been adduced, its inconsistency with another verdict does not create a constitutional defect.").
As his second ground for habeas relief, Muldrow claims that his appellate counsel was ineffective in failing to argue that he was improperly convicted of felony murder in light of the prosecution's alleged failure to prove a necessary element of burglary, the underlying felony charged in this case. Petitioner's Habeas Brief, Dkt. # 2 at 11. I find that this argument lacks merit and that counsel was justified in not raising it. Under New York law, all degrees of burglary require proof that the defendant "knowingly enter[ed] or remain[ed] unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein." See, e.g., P.L. § 140.25. Muldrow complains that "the trial proof was absent as to that intended *171 crime," leaving "the jury to speculate as to the intended crime." Dkt. # 2 at 12. As respondent points out, the prosecution need not establish what particular crime the intruder intended to commit in order to satisfy the elements of burglary under New York law. Respondent's Habeas Brief, Dkt. # 5 at 8 (citing People v. Mackey, 49 N.Y.2d 274, 279, 425 N.Y.S.2d 288, 401 N.E.2d 398 (1980) (the New York Penal Law "definition of burglary is satisfied if the intruder's intent, existing at the time of the unlawful entry or remaining, is to commit any crime")); accord People v. Gaines, 74 N.Y.2d 358, 362 n. 1, 547 N.Y.S.2d 620, 546 N.E.2d 913 (1989).
Moreover, it is not necessary for the intended crime to be committed. Rather, "the intent necessary can be inferred from the circumstances of the entry itself." Mackey, 49 N.Y.2d at 279, 425 N.Y.S.2d 288, 401 N.E.2d 398. Muldrow contends that the prosecution never proved that he entered the house. Dkt. # 2 at 12. Although the gunmen were wearing black hats and their faces were partially concealed by their clothing, there was more than adequate circumstantial evidence at trial placing Muldrow at the scene of the crime. Crutcher, who lived in an apartment commandeered by Stubbs, McGee and Muldrow to sell cocaine, see Tr. at 1265-73, 1301, overheard Muldrow and his associates planning to kidnap the witnesses to the murder committed by Usher, see id. at 1280-87. Crutcher paid a friend to steal a car for him which he in turn provided to the defendants.[3]Id. at 1293-1300. On the night of the murder, Stubbs showed Crutcher four guns in a bedroom at the apartment and said, "`[T]his is what we're going to use tonight.'" Id. at 1302-03. Later that evening, when the defendants left in search of the witnesses, Crutcher observed Muldrow armed with one of the guns Stubbs had shown him earlier. About 45 minutes later, Crutcher testified that Stubbs returned to the apartment acting in an extremely emotional manner and demanded to know whether Muldrow, McGee or Grimes had called. Id. at 1316-19.
The ballistics evidence provided further corroboration linking Muldrow to the shootings. Testing of the bullets recovered at the scene established that two of the guns found in Muldrow's apartment fired the bullets that killed one of the victims. The bullets fired at the second murder victim and the wounded victim shot were consistent with having come from a third gun found in Muldrow's apartment. In addition, Muldrow fled when the police stopped the car in which he was riding, but was caught after a foot chase. His unprovoked flight from the authorities reasonably could be viewed by the jury as an indicator of guilt. See United States v. Amuso, 21 F.3d 1251, 1259 (2d Cir.) (jury could rationally infer that flight was indicative of guilty conscience), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 932, 115 S.Ct. 326, 130 L.Ed.2d 286 (1994); Stone v. Stinson, 121 F.Supp.2d 226, 243 (W.D.N.Y. 2000) (petitioner's flight from Buffalo to Virginia following shootings could properly be considered by the jury as indicative of guilt); see also United States v. Malizia, 503 F.2d 578, 582-83 (2d Cir.1974) ("Evidence of flight, like any other circumstantial evidence, has consistently been admissible as evidence of guilt if considered with other facts of the case."), cert. denied, 420 U.S. 912, 95 S.Ct. 834, 42 L.Ed.2d 843 (1975).
There was ample testimony from which the jury could have inferred that Muldrow *172 unlawfully entered the victims' home and intended to commit a crime while there. Consequently, the argument that the prosecution failed to prove all the elements of the burglary underlying the felony murder charge likely would not have succeeded on direct appeal. Appellate counsel thus acted reasonably in failing to raise it, and Muldrow was not prejudiced by the omission of this meritless argument from his appeal. I find that Muldrow was represented ably by the public defender on his direct appeal, and that his claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel are without merit.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, Timothy Muldrow's petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254 is denied, and the petition is dismissed. Because Muldrow has failed to make a substantial showing of a denial of a constitutional right, no certificate of appealability shall issue. 28 U.S.C. § 2253. Further, I certify that any appeal from this order would not be taken in good faith. See 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a); Coppedge v. United States, 369 U.S. 438, 444, 82 S.Ct. 917, 8 L.Ed.2d 21 (1962).
IT IS SO ORDERED.
NOTES
[1]  Muldrow raised both of these claims in an application for a writ of error coram nobis which was summarily denied by the Fourth Department on April 27, 2001. See Petition, Docket ("Dkt.") # 1 at 8. Thus, the claims are exhausted and properly before this Court on habeas review.
[2]  The third and fourth counts of the indictment, each charging murder in the second degree in violation of P.L. §§ 125.25 and 20.00, state that the defendant "while acting alone or with one or more persons, committed or attempted to commit...."
[3]  Crutcher was deemed to be an accomplice as a matter of law based on his role in procuring the vehicle allegedly used by the defendants in their commission of the murders.

PER CURIAM.

       Randy P. Rumsey appeals from the district court's1 dismissal, for lack of
jurisdiction, of his petition for review of an agency determination that his claim for
disability insurance benefits was barred by administrative res judicata. We affirm.



      1
      The Honorable Robert T. Dawson, United States District Judge for the
Western District of Arkansas, adopting the Report and Recommendation of the
Honorable Beverly Stites Jones, United States Magistrate Judge.
A federal district court's jurisdiction to review decisions regarding disability
benefits is governed by 42 U.S.C. § 405(g). That section provides for review only of
a "final decision of the Commissioner . . . made after a hearing." An agency's
application of res judicata2 or refusal to reopen a prior determination is not a "final
decision" within the meaning of section 405(g). King v. Chater, 90 F.3d 323, 325
(8th Cir. 1996). But there is a narrow exception where the Commissioner reconsiders
the merits of an application previously denied. Id. (citing Jelinek v. Heckler, 764
F.2d 507, 508 (8th Cir. 1985)). Such a claim is treated as having been reopened as
a matter of administrative discretion and is, therefore, subject to judicial review to the
extent it has been reopened. Id.

       The Commissioner dismissed Rumsey's current application for disability
insurance benefits as duplicative of an earlier, unsuccessful claim that alleged the
same disability. After a hearing, an Administrative Law Judge ("ALJ") dismissed
Rumsey's present claim as barred by the final decision in his earlier claim. The ALJ
did not consider the merits of the earlier claim, but, as the district court noted, merely
"made a threshold inquiry into the facts and evidence of the previous application to
determine if the regulatory requirements for reopening the previous claim had been
met." Because the ALJ did not reopen Rumsey's earlier claim, and because its
dismissal for res judicata was not a "final decision" within the purview of 42 U.S.C.
§ 405(g), we have no jurisdiction to review it. We affirm the judgment of the district
court.




      2
       Under the Commissioner's regulations, a request for a hearing may be
dismissed as precluded by the doctrine of res judicata. 20 C.F.R. § 404.957(c)(1).
And this court has endorsed the application of res judicata in an administrative
context. Rush v. Sec'y of Health and Human Servs., 738 F.2d 909, 914 (8th Cir.
1984).

KINSER, Justice.
In this personal injury action, the sole question is whether the circuit court correctly ruled that an employee's exclusive remedy against an employer is under the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act (the Act), Code §§ 65.2-100 through -1310. Because we conclude that the employee suffered an "injury by accident arising out of and in the course of . . . employment," Code § 65.2-101, we will affirm the circuit court's judgment sustaining the employer's special plea in bar.

FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS
Virginia Electric and Power Company (Virginia Power) arranged for an independent instructor to teach an aerobics class at its Richmond office for the benefit of its employees. Participation in the class by Virginia Power's employees was voluntary. Virginia Power advertised the class on its bulletin boards and in its newsletter. It did not charge for the use of its facility, but participating employees were required to pay a fee to the instructor for the class.
The plaintiff, Laura Lee Combs, was an employee of Virginia Power. During her lunch hour on May 24, 1994, Combs participated in the aerobics class and, while doing so, developed a severe headache. The aerobics instructor assisted Combs in lying down and then called Virginia Power's Employee Health Services (EHS), as she had been instructed to do by the EHS coordinator of health programs. The EHS receptionist answered the call and informed Sharon Robinson, EHS coordinator of administrative support, that someone in the aerobics class had a headache and needed some medication. Shortly thereafter, Robinson went to the aerobics room to determine what was happening with regard to Combs. When Combs' head pain did not subside, she was taken to the EHS "quiet room" to rest. The "quiet room" is used by employees who become ill at work, or by recuperating employees who have returned to work after an accident or illness and need to rest during the workday. When an employee is using the room, an EHS staff member is required to be in the office, and the employee is to be checked at regular intervals.
After she went to the "quiet room," Combs was not examined by any medical or emergency personnel, nor was her condition regularly monitored by anyone. Approximately two hours after Combs entered the "quiet room," Robinson checked on Combs and discovered that Combs had vomited on herself and was in a coma-like state. Robinson then called security. Combs was eventually transported by ambulance to the Medical College of Virginia where she was diagnosed with intracranial bleeding, a right giant middle cerebral aneurysm, and an intraparenchymal hemorrhage. She subsequently underwent two neurological operations. After release from the hospital, she entered a rehabilitation center where she received therapy for her partial paralysis and cognitive brain damage.
On April 30, 1996, Combs filed a motion for judgment against Virginia Power and four of its employees, alleging that the defendants owed her a duty to "have in place proper procedures, and to properly train ... personnel, so that employees using EHS could do so without harm to themselves and detriment to their well-being." Combs further asserted that the defendants breached these duties and were negligent by, inter alia, failing to properly train non-medical personnel working in EHS; failing to implement procedures to provide appropriate medical care to Virginia Power employees who seek treatment at EHS, especially when licensed healthcare professionals are unavailable; and failing to provide proper medical care and treatment when Combs suffered a medical emergency, thereby leaving her unattended for approximately two hours before calling security and *281 a rescue squad. Finally, Combs alleged that the defendants' negligence proximately caused her injury and damages.[2]
In response, the defendants filed grounds of defense and a "Special Plea of Workers' Compensation Bar." In the special plea, they asserted that the exclusivity provision of the Act, Code § 65.2-307, barred Combs' claim and therefore deprived the circuit court of subject matter jurisdiction over her claim.[3] Accordingly, the defendants asked the court to dismiss Combs' action.
After reviewing the parties' memoranda, the circuit court sustained the special plea and dismissed Combs' action with prejudice. In a letter opinion, the court concluded that the aggravation and acceleration of Combs' pre-existing aneurysm was "an injury by accident arising out of and in the course of her employment with" Virginia Power, and that her action was therefore barred by the exclusivity provision of the Act. We awarded Combs this appeal.

ANALYSIS
"An injury is subject to the exclusivity provision of the Act if it is the result of an accident and arises out of and in the course of the employment." Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Hazelwood, 249 Va. 369, 372, 457 S.E.2d 56, 58 (1995). Thus, the critical inquiry in this appeal is whether Combs' injury was (1) an injury by accident, (2) arising out of, (3) and in the course of, her employment. See Code § 65.2-101; Briley v. Farm Fresh, Inc., 240 Va. 194, 197, 396 S.E.2d 835, 836 (1990). If any one of these elements is missing, then Combs' claim is not covered by the Act, Snead v. Harbaugh, 241 Va. 524, 526, 404 S.E.2d 53, 54 (1991), and she can proceed with her personal injury claim in the circuit court. Thus, we will address each of these criteria seriatim.

I. INJURY BY ACCIDENT
This Court recently addressed the requirements of an "injury by accident" in Southern Express v. Green, 257 Va. 181, 509 S.E.2d 836 (1999). There, we held that an "injury by accident" occurs when the injury appears "suddenly at a particular time and place[,] and upon a particular occasion[;]" when it is "caused by an identifiable incident[,] or sudden precipitating event[;]" and when the injury results "in an obvious mechanical or structural change in the human body." Id. at 187, 509 S.E.2d at 839. The circuit court found all these factors present with regard to Combs' injury, and we agree.
At the outset, it must be emphasized that Combs' injury is not the aneurysm itself. Instead, her injury is the aggravation, exacerbation, and/or acceleration of the aneurysm. That injury resulted from the alleged negligent emergency medical care, or lack thereof, that she received from Virginia Power and its EHS employees after she suffered a severe headache during the aerobics class. Thus, Combs' argument that there is no evidence with regard to when the aneurysm initially started leaking or when she experienced the first onset of symptoms is irrelevant to the question whether she sustained an "injury by accident."
The record in this case, in particular Combs' motion for judgment, demonstrates that she suffered an "injury by accident" under Code § 65.2-101. The particular time, place, and occasion of her injury was at the EHS "quiet room" in Virginia Power's Richmond office, during the two to three hours that elapsed from when she first developed the headache and was taken to the "quiet room" until she was transported to the hospital. The identifiable or precipitating event was the alleged negligent emergency medical treatment that she received during this span of time. Finally, Combs' paralysis and cognitive brain damage represent the mechanical or structural changes in her body that resulted *282 from her injury. Thus, all the requirements of an "injury by accident" are present in this case. See Winn v. Geo. A. Hormel & Co., 252 Neb. 29, 560 N.W.2d 143, 149 (1997)(holding that negligent medical treatment at employer's first-aid medical facility may constitute "accident").

II. ARISING OUT OF EMPLOYMENT
The phrase "arising out of" pertains to the origin or cause of an injury. County of Chesterfield v. Johnson, 237 Va. 180, 183, 376 S.E.2d 73, 74 (1989); Bradshaw v. Aronovitch, 170 Va. 329, 335, 196 S.E. 684, 686 (1938). In determining whether an injury arises out of employment, we have repeatedly quoted with approval the test enunciated in In re Employers' Liab. Assur. Corp., Ltd., 215 Mass. 497, 102 N.E. 697 (1913). An injury
arises "out of" the employment, when there is apparent to the rational mind upon consideration of all the circumstances, a causal connection between the conditions under which the work is required to be performed and the resulting injury. Under this test, if the injury can be seen to have followed as a natural incident of the work and to have been contemplated by a reasonable person familiar with the whole situation as a result of the exposure occasioned by the nature of the employment, then it arises "out of" the employment. But it excludes an injury which cannot fairly be traced to the employment as a contributing proximate cause and which comes from a hazard to which the workmen would have been equally exposed apart from the employment. The causative danger must be peculiar to the work and not common to the neighborhood. It must be incidental to the character of the business and not independent of the relation of master and servant. It need not have been foreseen or expected, but after the event it must appear to have had its origin in a risk connected with the employment, and to have flowed from that source as a rational consequence.
Id. at 697; accord Lucas v. Lucas, 212 Va. 561, 563, 186 S.E.2d 63, 64 (1972); Conner v. Bragg, 203 Va. 204, 208-09, 123 S.E.2d 393, 396-97 (1962); Bradshaw, 170 Va. at 335, 196 S.E. at 686.
In Virginia, we apply an "actual risk test," meaning that the employment must expose the employee to the particular danger causing the injury, notwithstanding the public's exposure generally to similar risks. Lucas, 212 Va. at 563, 186 S.E.2d at 64. Thus, if there is a causal connection between Combs' injury and the conditions of her employment, then her injury arose out of her employment. See United Parcel Serv. of Am. v. Fetterman, 230 Va. 257, 258, 336 S.E.2d 892, 893 (1985) ("An accident arises out of the employment when there is a causal connection between the claimant's injury and the conditions under which the employer requires the work to be performed.").
Combs argues that EHS was not actually a clinic for the treatment of employee health problems and that, therefore, it was not a condition of her employment. Thus, she contends that her injury did not "arise out of" her employment. Assuming that Combs is correct about the purpose of EHS, the fact remains that on the day in question, the risk of employment was the alleged negligent emergency medical treatment by EHS personnel, which aggravated her pre-existing aneurysm. Combs was exposed to this risk or condition of employment solely because she was a Virginia Power employee. The public generally would not have been exposed to the same risk because only Virginia Power employees could utilize EHS. In fact, Combs alleged in her motion for judgment that Virginia Power and its employees owed certain duties to her "so that employees using EHS could do so without harm to themselves and detriment to their well-being," and that the defendants violated those duties, thereby causing injury to her. She further asserted that the employee defendants were acting within the scope of their employment when they allegedly injured her.
Combs, nevertheless, argues that her situation is like that of the employee in Taylor v. Mobil Corp., 248 Va. 101, 444 S.E.2d 705 (1994), because she did not involuntarily, or out of "default[]" as the circuit court found, seek medical treatment at EHS. In Taylor, an employee visited a doctor at his employer's *283 clinic for treatment of a heart condition. The employee ultimately suffered a fatal heart attack at home although the doctor had advised him that he was not suffering from heart disease. Id. at 103-04, 444 S.E.2d at 706-07. This Court concluded that the employee's risk of exposure to negligent treatment by the doctor was not an actual risk of employment because the employee voluntarily opted to use the doctor at the employer's clinic. He was not required to do so by his employer, nor was he treated by that doctor because he became ill at work. Id. at 107, 444 S.E.2d at 708.
In contrast, Combs suffered her severe headache while participating in the aerobics class at Virginia Power's office. While taking part in that class was not required by Virginia Power, EHS personnel treated Combs because of her status as a Virginia Power employee. In fact, the aerobics instructor called EHS when Combs became ill because Virginia Power's EHS coordinator had directed the instructor to do so. Thus, the risk that led to Combs' injury was part of her work environment. See Briley, 240 Va. at 198, 396 S.E.2d at 837.
Additionally, the fact that her injury was the aggravation of a pre-existing condition does not alter the result that her injury arose out of her employment. See Ohio Valley Const. Co. v. Jackson, 230 Va. 56, 58, 334 S.E.2d 554, 555 (1985) ("When an injury sustained in an industrial accident accelerates or aggravates a pre-existing condition, death or disability resulting therefrom is compensable under the Workers' Compensation Act."). Combs' pre-existing aneurysm united with an actual risk of her employment to produce her injury.

III. IN THE COURSE OF EMPLOYMENT
"The phrase arising `in the course of' [employment] refers to the time, place, and circumstances under which the accident occurred." Johnson, 237 Va. at 183, 376 S.E.2d at 74. "An accident occurs `in the course of the employment' when it takes place within the period of the employment, at a place where the employee may reasonably be, and while he is reasonably fulfilling duties of his employment or engaged in doing something incidental thereto." Bradshaw, 170 Va. at 335, 196 S.E. at 686; accord Lucas, 212 Va. at 563, 186 S.E.2d at 64; Conner, 203 Va. at 208, 123 S.E.2d at 396.
Combs argues she was not performing any duty of her employment at the moment when she initially needed emergency medical treatment. As she correctly notes, the pre-existing aneurysm was not caused by her employment, and she was participating in an aerobics class during her lunch hour when she first experienced the headache. Thus, she contends that "the reason she ended up at EHS was not in any way connected with her employment[,]" and, therefore, that her injury did not occur during the course of her employment. We do not agree.
Combs' position on this issue overlooks several salient facts. First, Combs is not seeking redress for the onset of the symptoms associated with the aneurysm but for the aggravation of that pre-existing condition. The aggravation of the aneurysm occurred after EHS personnel responded to the call for assistance from the aerobics instructor, during Combs' period of employment, and at a place where she could reasonably be if she became ill at work, i.e., the "quiet room." The only reason that EHS responded to that call was because Combs was a Virginia Power employee. Thus, Combs "was injured at a place where she was reasonably expected to be while engaged in an activity reasonably incidental to her employment" by Virginia Power. Briley, 240 Va. at 198, 396 S.E.2d at 837. Her injury therefore occurred "in the course of" her employment.

CONCLUSION
For these reasons, we conclude that Combs' injury was an "injury by accident arising out of and in the course of [her] employment" with Virginia Power, Code § 65.2-101, and is therefore compensable under the Act. Her action in the circuit court is thus barred by Code § 65.2-307. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the circuit court.
Affirmed.

766 F.Supp.2d 797 (2011)
In the Matter of the COMPLAINT OF PRIDE OFFSHORE, INC., as Owner of the J/U Pride Wyoming for Exoneration from, or Alternatively, Limitation of Liability.
Civil Action No. H-08-3109.
United States District Court, S.D. Texas, Houston Division.
February 2, 2011.


*798 MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
LEE H. ROSENTHAL, District Judge.
This maritime dispute arises out of damage allegedly caused when a jack-up rig, the PRIDE WYOMING, detached from its moorings during Hurricane Ike in September 2008. Pride Offshore, Inc.,[1] the rig owner, filed a complaint in exoneration or alternatively for limitation of liability, (Docket Entry No. 1), and Century Exploration New Orleans, Inc. filed a claim, (Docket Entry No. 47). Pride Offshore moved for summary judgment, arguing that the economic-loss rule precludes Century Exploration's claim. (Docket Entry No. 75). Century Exploration responded with a different theory and asked for leave to amend. (Docket Entry No. 77). Pride Offshore replied, arguing that this court should grant its motion for summary judgment and deny Century Exploration's motion to amend as futile. (Docket Entry No. 78).
For the reasons explained below, this court grants Pride Offshore's motion for summary judgment, but to the extent the motion was based on a challenge to the sufficiency of the claim allegations, Century Exploration is granted leave to amend. An amended complaint must be filed by February 25, 2011.

I. Background
The PRIDE WYOMING was a 250-foot mat slot jack-up rig operating in the Gulf *799 of Mexico. (Docket Entry No. 1 ¶ 4). When Hurricane Ike struck in September 2008, the rig was located in Ship Shoal Block 283, about 90 miles south of Houma, Louisiana. (Id. ¶ 5). The hurricane blew the rig off its location, causing it to sink. (Id. ¶ 6). Parts of the PRIDE WYOMING's wreckage settled on top of pipelines belonging to The Williams Companies, Inc. and Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (TGPS). (Id. ¶ 7).
Pride Offshore filed this complaint on October 20, 2008. (Docket Entry No. 1). On August 18, 2009, Century Exploration filed its claim, alleging that part of the wreckage from the PRIDE WYOMING "struck and damaged pipelines that interfered with Century's operations and necessitated repairs. Century had property interests in one such pipeline and contributed to its repairs." (Docket Entry No. 47, ¶ 3). Century Exploration claimed approximately $21 million in damages "caused solely by, and ... wholly due to, the unseaworthiness of the J/U Pride Wyoming, the negligence of her master and crew, and the negligence of her owners and operators." (Id. ¶¶ 5-6). On January 11, 2010, Century Exploration amended to add allegations of recklessness and intentional misconduct. (Docket Entry No. 63 ¶ 5). Neither version of the claim alleged that Century Exploration was aware of Pride Offshore's contract to use the TGPC pipeline.
Pride Offshore argues that summary judgment is appropriate for two reasons. The first is that Century Exploration's amended claim is insufficient because it fails to allege that Pride Offshore knew of Century Exploration's contract with TGPC. The second is that Century Exploration lacks evidence of a proprietary interest in the pipeline that would support economic-loss damages for negligence.

II. Analysis

A. The Legal Standards
Pride Offshore's motion concerns the application of the Robins Dry Dock rule. In Robins Dry Dock & Repair Co. v. Flint, 275 U.S. 303, 48 S.Ct. 134, 72 L.Ed. 290 (1927), the Supreme Court overturned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs for breach of contract based on damage to a third party's property. "Their loss arose only through their contract with the owners and while intentionally to bring about a breach of contract may give rise to a cause of action, no authority need be cited to show that, as a general rule, at least, a tort to the person or property of one man does not make the tort-feasor liable to another merely because the injured person was under a contract with that other unknown to the doer of the wrong." Id. at 308-09, 48 S.Ct. 134 (citations omitted). "Although criticized from time to time, Robins Dry Dock remains good law." Allders Int'l Ltd. v. United States, No. 94 CIV. 5689(JSM), 1995 WL 251571, *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 28, 1995). "The Fifth Circuit continues to apply the Robins Dry Dock principle to most maritime cases, carving out an exception only for cases involving a collision between two vessels not in privity of contract." Norwegian Bulk Transport A/S v. Int'l Marine Terminals Partnership, 520 F.3d 409, 412 (5th Cir.2008) (citing Amoco Transport Co. v. S/S MASON LYKES, 768 F.2d 659 (5th Cir.1985)). "Since the Amoco Transport decision, the Fifth Circuit ... has not recognized exceptions to the rule in Robins Dry Dock outside of the context of collision cases." Id. at 413 (citations omitted).
The first ground Pride Offshore asserts in moving for summary judgment rests on the sufficiency of Century Exploration's amended complaint. "[A] summary-judgment motion may be made on the basis of the pleadings alone, and if this is done it *800 functionally is the same as a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim ...." 10A CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER & MARY KAY KANE, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 2713, at 222-23 (3d ed. 1998) (citations omitted). A complaint may be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) for "failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted." FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6). In Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007), and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009), the Supreme Court confirmed that Rule 12(b)(6) must be read in conjunction with Rule 8(a), which requires "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." Twombly abrogated the Supreme Court's prior statement in Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957), that "a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief." See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 562-63, 127 S.Ct. 1955 ("Conley's `no set of facts' language... is best forgotten as an incomplete, negative gloss on an accepted pleading standard...."). To withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a complaint must contain "enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955; see also Elsensohn v. St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office, 530 F.3d 368, 372 (5th Cir.2008) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955). The Court explained that "the pleading standard Rule 8 announces does not require `detailed factual allegations,' but it demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation." Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. at 1949 (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955).
When a plaintiff's complaint fails to state a claim, the court should generally give the plaintiff at least one chance to amend the complaint under Rule 15(a) before dismissing the action with prejudice. See Great Plains Trust Co. v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., 313 F.3d 305, 329 (5th Cir.2002) ("[D]istrict courts often afford plaintiffs at least one opportunity to cure pleading deficiencies before dismissing a case, unless it is clear that the defects are incurable or the plaintiffs advise the court that they are unwilling or unable to amend in a manner that will avoid dismissal."); see also United States ex rel. Adrian v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 363 F.3d 398, 403 (5th Cir.2004) ("Leave to amend should be freely given, and outright refusal to grant leave to amend without a justification ... is considered an abuse of discretion." (internal citation omitted)). However, a plaintiff should be denied leave to amend a complaint if the court determines that "a proposed amendment ... clearly is frivolous, advancing a claim or defense that is legally insufficient on its face ...." 6 WRIGHT, MILLER & KANE § 1487, at 732-33; see also Ayers v. Johnson, 247 Fed.Appx. 534, 535 (5th Cir.2007) (unpublished) (per curiam) ("`[A] district court acts within its discretion when dismissing a motion to amend that is frivolous or futile.'" (quoting Martin's Herend Imports, Inc. v. Diamond & Gem Trading U.S. of Am. Co., 195 F.3d 765, 771 (5th Cir.1999))).
The second basis for Pride Offshore's motion is the sufficiency of the evidence in the record to raise a disputed fact issue material to Century Exploration's claim. Summary judgment is appropriate if no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a). "The movant bears the burden of identifying those portions of the record it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Triple Tee Golf, Inc. v. Nike, Inc., 485 F.3d 253, 261 (5th Cir. 2007) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 *801 U.S. 317, 322-25, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)). If the burden of proof at trial lies with the nonmoving party, the movant may satisfy its initial burden by "`showing'that is, pointing out to the district courtthat there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548. While the party moving for summary judgment must demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, it does not need to negate the elements of the nonmovant's case. Boudreaux v. Swift Transp. Co., 402 F.3d 536, 540 (5th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). "A fact is `material' if its resolution in favor of one party might affect the outcome of the lawsuit under governing law." Sossamon v. Lone Star State of Tex., 560 F.3d 316, 326 (5th Cir.2009) (quotation omitted). "If the moving party fails to meet [its] initial burden, the motion [for summary judgment] must be denied, regardless of the nonmovant's response." United States v. $92,203.00 in U.S. Currency, 537 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.2008) (quoting Little v. Liquid Air Corp., 37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir. 1994) (en banc)).
When the moving party has met its Rule 56(a) burden, the nonmoving party cannot survive a summary judgment motion by resting on the mere allegations of its pleadings. The nonmovant must identify specific evidence in the record and articulate how that evidence supports that party's claim. Baranowski v. Hart, 486 F.3d 112, 119 (5th Cir.2007). "This burden will not be satisfied by `some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts, by conclusory allegations, by unsubstantiated assertions, or by only a scintilla of evidence.'" Boudreaux, 402 F.3d at 540 (quoting Little, 37 F.3d at 1075). In deciding a summary judgment motion, the court draws all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Connors v. Graves, 538 F.3d 373, 376 (5th Cir.2008).

B. Whether Century Exploration's Amended Claim Sufficiently Alleges Intentional Interference with Its Contractual Relations
Century Exploration's amended claim alleges that Pride Offshore acted recklessly and intentionally. Citing Nautilus Marine, Inc. v. Niemela, 170 F.3d 1195, 1196-97 (9th Cir. 1999), Pride Offshore argues that "there is no exception to the Robins Dry Dock rule for intentional or reckless conduct." (Docket Entry No. 75 at 6). Century Exploration responds that Pride Offshore overstates the holding of Nautilus Marine. According to Century Exploration, the Ninth Circuit in Nautilus Marine did not rule that a defendant intentionally interfering with a contract would be covered by the economic-loss rule. Instead, the court ruled only that a defendant acting without knowledge of the contract in question would be covered by that rule. (Docket Entry No. 77 at 3 (citing Nautilus Marine, 170 F.3d at 1196-97)). Century Exploration argues that Pride Offshore "intentionally placed a patently inadequate rig on the [sea floor], knowing that it would not withstand hurricane force conditions and would not remain on site. Pride, a long-time driller on the [Outer Continental Shelf] knew that if the rig came loose, it would certainly damage subsea pipelines which permeate the seabed. Pride also knew that the producers on the [Outer Continental Shelf] would have contracts with pipeline owners to transport the oil and gas to shore, and knew that the damage to the pipelines would cause the production facilities to shut down." (Docket Entry No. 77 at 6).
The arguments that Century Exploration makes in its response are not alleged in its claim, even as amended. Century Exploration's amended claim does not refer to Pride Offshore's knowledge of its contract with TGPC. Acknowledging this *802 gap, Century Exploration asks leave to file an amended complaint reciting these factual allegations. (Id. at 6 n. 4).
Pride Offshore argues that the proposed amended claim would be futile. Pride Offshore faults Century Exploration for:
fall[ing] short of alleging that [Pride Offshore] ever had actual knowledge of Century's contracts with TGPC. Century is simply trying to ignore the requirement that [Pride Offshore] have actual knowledge of the contracts because it could never prove such an allegation, and it is attempting to get by with merely alleging reckless allision. However, as the Ninth Circuit made clear, `an intent to allide does not equate to an intent to interfere with the defendant's contract.' [Pride Offshore] must have had actual knowledge of Century's contract with TGPC and let its drilling rig loose in a hurricane in order to interfere with a particular contract. Century knows it is unable to even plausibly allege that [Pride Offshore] had actual knowledge of Century's contracts with TGPC, or intentional interference with these contracts, and therefore Century's proposed pleadings amendment would be futile.
(Docket Entry No. 78 at 4-5) (footnote, citation, and alterations omitted).
In responding to Century Exploration's arguments, Pride Offshore appears to have scaled back its characterization of the Nautilus Marine court's holding. In the response, Pride Offshore characterizes the case as holding that "an intent to allide does not equate to an attempt to interfere with the defendant's contract." (Docket Entry No. 78 at 5 (quoting Nautilus Marine, 170 F.3d at 1197) (alterations omitted)). This accurately reflects the holding. The Ninth Circuit distinguished the facts before it from those in "cases holding that Robins Dry Dock does not preclude recovery for intentional interference with contract relations." Nautilus Marine, 170 F.3d at 1197. "The key to these cases," the court explained, "is not merely that the tort is intentional, but that the tortfeasor knew of the plaintiff's contractual relation and intended to interfere with it. Nautilus has not stated a claim of intentional interference with contractual relations, however, precisely because it did not allege, and could not show, such knowledge and intent." Id. (citations omitted). Century Exploration's characterization of the holding is consistent.
Because Century Exploration has effectively sought leave to amend without filing a proposed amended complaint, it is difficult to determine whether it proposes to allege that Pride Offshore knew of specific contracts between Century Exploration and TGPC or that Pride Offshore knew that Century Exploration had to have contracts with some pipeline owner. To provide a sufficient basis to rule on the futility claim, Century Exploration will be granted leave to file an amended complaint. The allegations in an amended claim will enable Pride Offshore to clarify the basis for its motion to dismiss and enable this court to rule whether the allegations are sufficient. The motion for summary judgment based on the adequacy of the pleadings is granted, with leave to amend.

C. Whether Century Exploration Has a Proprietary Interest in the Pipeline
Pride Offshore also argues that summary judgment is appropriate under Robins Dry Dock for any claim based on Pride Offshore's negligence on the basis that the undisputed facts show that Century Exploration did not have a proprietary interest in the damaged pipeline. Courts consider three factors to determine whether a plaintiff's interest is proprietary: "actual possession or control, responsibility *803 for repair and responsibility for maintenance." IMTT-Gretna v. Robert E. Lee SS, 993 F.2d 1193, 1194 (5th Cir.1993) (summary calendar) (citing Tex. Eastern Trans. v. McMoRan Offshore Explor., 877 F.2d 1214, 1225 (5th Cir.1989)). If a plaintiff cannot meet any of the factors, the case must be dismissed. Id.
In its response, Century Exploration explains that it "does not rely upon" a proprietary interest in the pipeline to justify recovery. (Docket Entry No. 77 at 1-2). This statement, as Pride Offshore points out, abandons the negligence claim.
Century Exploration does not concede that Pride Offshore is correct. In a footnote, citing no authority, Century Offshore argues:
With respect to the proprietary interest issue, the evidence is, and [Pride Offshore] does not dispute, that subsequent to the pipeline damage, Century contributed to the cost of repairs. One of the critical indicia of proprietary interest is liability for repairs. The fact that Century incurred this liability post-accident is immaterial. Century's contribution to repairs is sufficient evidence of its proprietary interest. At a minimum, Century is entitled to recover its contribution to the repair costs.
(Id. at 2 n. 1). Pride Offshore responds in a footnote of its own, also without citing authority: "Although `responsibility for repairs' is one factor considered in determining whether a proprietary interest existed at the time of the damage, Century has already admitted that it was not responsible for repairs to the [pipeline] at the time of the alleged damage." (Docket Entry No. 78 at 2 n. 3).
Century Offshore has acknowledged that it has no proprietary interest in the pipeline. Its contribution to the repair costs does not raise a fact issue as to whether it has a negligence claim against Pride Offshore seeking to recover such payments. The motion for summary judgment based on the absence of a proprietary interest in the damaged pipeline is granted.

III. Conclusion

WOODWORKERS TOOL WORKSv.BYRNE.
No. 13236.
United States Court of Appeals Ninth Circuit.
March 10, 1953.

Tripp & Calloway, Los Angeles, Cal., for appellant.
John W. Olson, Los Angeles, Cal., for appellee.
Before STEPHENS, HEALY, and POPE, Circuit Judges.
HEALY, Circuit Judge.


1
This action is for damages for personal injury sustained by appellee in consequence of the disintegration of an allegedly defective panel raiser head manufactured by appellant, an Illinois corporation, and shipped by it to appellee's employer in California, of which state appellee is a resident. A verdict awarding damages was returned and a judgment entered thereon.


2
On appeal from that judgment, Woodworkers Tool Works v. Byrne, 9 Cir., 191 F.2d 667, this court held with appellee on the merits. But a motion of appellant to quash the service of summons had been denied by the trial court, and we thought, 191 F.2d at pages 670-673, that the showing before the court at the time the motion was ruled on, going to the issue whether appellant had constituted one Preuer by law an agent in California to receive service of process on its behalf, was insufficient to warrant the denial. We noted, however, that during the course of the trial substantial oral evidence had been received tending to show the existence of the necessary agency relationship between appellant and Preuer, and we summarize this evidence, 191 F.2d at page 673; but it was further noted that the trial judge regarded the jurisdictional problem as having already been determined, hence had not taken the oral evidence into account except for such bearing as it might have on the merits.


3
We were of opinion that the issue of the validity of the service, inasmuch as it was one of due process, was open to further examination and that the evidence adduced on the trial might properly be considered as supplementing the original showing on that issue. We said, 191 F.2d at page 673, that "if there be added to the evidence which was before the court at the time of the denial of the motion to quash the service of the summons the evidence adduced at the trial, particularly that of Preuer hereinbefore referred to there might be a basis to sustain a conclusion that Woodworkers Tool Works had made Preuer its agent. This issue cannot be resolved without a finding thereon by the trier of fact and therefore upon remand it will be necessary for the court below to make an appropriate finding upon the present record."


4
After consideration and disposition of the remaining issues the court made the following order: "To the end that the court below may determine the question of whether the evidence now in the record is sufficient to sustain Byrne's contention that Woodworkers Tool Works made Woodworkers Supply Company, viz., Preuer, its agent for the service of process in California, we vacate the judgment and remand the cause with the direction to the court below to proceed to determine that issue. If the court determines the evidence of agency to be sufficient it will possess the authority to reinstate the judgment."1


5
Neither party petitioned for a rehearing.


6
Upon remand the trial court on the existing record made appropriate findings of fact as shown in the footnote,2 and concluded that at and prior to time of service appellant was doing business in California through Preuer as its agent, and had by law constituted him its agent in California to receive service of process in its behalf. The judgment was ordered reinstated.


7
From the reinstated judgment appellant has taken the present appeal, claiming that the evidence is insufficient to support the court's finding of agency. Is the point now open to inquiry? We think not. This court's original decision constitutes the law of the case. It clearly implied that on the evidence in the record the issue was one of fact for the trial court's determination, not one of law for ourselves. Had we deemed the evidence insufficient as a matter of law to support a finding of jurisdiction it would have been worse than an impertinence to remand the case for a finding. We would have been obliged to reverse the judgment outright. Nor, if we were in doubt whether on that evidence a finding of jurisdiction could be sustained by us, would we have thought it proper to undertake at that juncture the very considerable and perhaps wholly futile task of passing on the merits. Taking the opinion by its four corners we construe it as holding that the trial court's finding of fact was to be accepted as conclusive of the question of the validity of the service.


8
True, the rule we apply here is not a compulsive principle akin to res judicata. The phrase law of the case expresses rather the general practice of the courts to decline to reopen what they have already in effect decided. Messenger v. Anderson, 225 U.S. 436, 444, 32 S.Ct. 739, 56 L.Ed. 1152. Cf. People of State of Illinois ex rel. Hunt v. Illinois Central R. Co., 184 U.S. 77, 91, 22 S.Ct. 300, 46 L.Ed. 440. The rule is grounded in large part on the policy of ending litigation, and in some instances on the want of power in an appellate court to modify its own judgments otherwise than on a rehearing. And it has been pointedly observed that if the practice were not followed, changes in the personnel of the court would produce confusion. Clary v. Hoagland, 6 Cal. 685; Oakley v. Aspinwall, 13 N.Y. 500, 501. For a comprehensive statement of the doctrine and for citations of the almost numberless cases bearing on it, see 5 C.J.S., Appeal and Error, § 1821 et seq.; 21 C.J.S., Courts, § 195 et seq.


9
Application of the doctrine in this instance would result in no injustice or hardship since a trial on the merits has already been had.


10
Affirmed.



Notes:


1
 The formal judgment entered by our clerk followed explicitly this language, and directed also an equal division of the costs of the appeal


2
 "That Elmer Preuer is the sole proprietor of Woodworkers Supply Company; that defendant, Woodworkers Tool Works, a corporation, was engaged in selling its products in California through the agency of said Woodworkers Supply Company; that the panel raiser head involved in this action was sold to plaintiff's employer, Selby Company, in California by defendant through said Woodworkers Supply Company; that defendant had a running course of business every year and sold some of its items at all times in California through said Woodworkers Supply Company on a commission basis; that defendant's business of selling its products in California through the agency of said Woodworkers Supply Company was continuous and systematic; that said panel raiser head as well as other products of defendant sold in California were shipped by defendant company directly to the purchasers through orders received from Woodworkers Supply Company and paid for by purchasers through said Woodworkers Supply Company; that said Woodworkers Supply Company was the agent of defendant, Woodworkers Tool Works, as their identity of names implies."

MEMORANDUM BY McLAUGHLIN, J.:                             FILED JULY 26, 2019

        Erik R. Surratt appeals from the judgment of sentence entered following

a resentencing hearing pursuant to Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S. 460 (2012),

and Montgomery v. Louisiana, 136 S.Ct. 718 (2016). Surratt claims that in

fashioning his sentence, the PCRA1 court erroneously considered him an adult,

failed to consider whether he was capable of rehabilitation, and failed to

consider the Miller factors. We affirm.

        Surratt was one of three individuals involved in a shooting that resulted

in the death of two victims and one victim being wounded. Surratt shot one

of the victims that died. Surratt was approximately 17 ½ years old at the time

of the murders. A jury convicted Surratt of two counts of first-degree murder

and other offenses. In 2008, the trial court sentenced Surratt to two life
____________________________________________


1   Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 9541-9546.
J-A08035-19



sentences without parole and 25 to 50 years’ incarceration for the remaining

charges. This Court affirmed the judgment of sentence. In 2017, the PCRA

court granted Surratt a resentencing, pursuant to Miller and Montgomery.

At the resentencing hearing, Surratt presented five witnesses. One of the

witnesses was a forensic social worker who testified to Surratt’s rehabilitation.

Following two hearings, the PCRA court resentenced Surratt to 40 years’

incarceration to life imprisonment. Surratt filed a post-sentence motion which

the trial court denied. This timely appeal followed.

      On appeal, Surratt raises the following issues:

      I.     Whether the lower court erred and abused its discretion
             in imposing a 40-year minimum sentence because the
             Court failed to acknowledge or appropriately consider the
             factors laid out in Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S. 460
             (2012), and Montgomery v. Louisiana, 136 S.Ct. 718
             (2016), in light of the diminished capabilities and greater
             prospects for reform of the adolescent offender.

      II.    Whether the lower court erred and abused its discretion
             by placing excessive weight on the facts of the crime
             rather than focusing on Miller’s central question of
             whether the juvenile is capable of rehabilitation. The
             facts of the murder are not determinative in assessing
             permanent incorrigibility.

      III.   Whether the lower court erred and abused its discretion
             by impermissibly considering Mr. Surratt to be an adult
             at the time of the offense, repeatedly referring the
             “arbitrary line” the U.S. Supreme Court had drawn
             between offenders under the age of 18 and those who
             are 18 and older. The Court does not have the discretion
             to make a finding contrary to the United States Supreme
             Court’s “legal conclusion[s] . . . and the facts (scientific
             studies) underlying it” when it concerns the inherent
             traits associated with adolescent development. See
             Commonwealth v. Batts, 163 A.3d 410, 437 (Pa.

                                       -2-
J-A08035-19


             2017). Because the Commonwealth failed to introduce
             any new evidence at the resentencing hearing, the Court
             also lacked competent evidence to make the
             aforementioned finding.

Surratt’s Br. at 6-7.

      Surratt’s first two claims challenge discretionary aspects of his sentence.

See Commonwealth v. White, 193 A.3d 977, 981 (Pa.Super. 2018)

(concluding claims that trial court failed to consider Miller factors and did not

consider rehabilitative evidence are challenges to discretionary aspects of

sentence).   As such, we must first determine whether: (1) the appeal is

timely; (2) the issue is preserved; (3) appellant’s brief includes a Pa.R.A.P.

2119(f)   statement;    and   (4)   a   substantial   question   is   raised.   See

Commonwealth v. Battles, 169 A.3d 1086, 1090 (Pa.Super. 2017).

      Here, Surratt has satisfied the first three factors. We now address

whether he has raised a substantial question. Surratt maintains that the PCRA

court imposed an excessive sentence and failed to consider his mitigating

factors. He claims that the PCRA court incorrectly “considered [him] an adult

at the time of the crime, and focused on the life without parole sentences

imposed on [his] adult co-defendants.” Surratt’s Br. at 14-15. He also

maintains that the sentence imposed by the court is excessive for a crime that

was committed by a juvenile and is “contrary to the fundamental norms

underlying the sentencing process, and is inconsistent with the Sentencing

Code.” Id. at 15.




                                        -3-
J-A08035-19


       Surratt’s claim of an excessive sentence paired with a claim that the

court failed to consider his mitigating factors raises a substantial question.

See Commonwealth v. Swope, 123 A.3d 333, 339 (Pa.Super. 2015).

Therefore, we will address the merit of his claims.

       We review a challenge to discretionary aspects of sentencing for an

abuse of discretion. See Commonwealth v. Derry, 150 A.3d 987, 997

(Pa.Super. 2016). An abuse of discretion exists where “the sentencing court

ignored or misapplied the law, exercised its judgment for reasons of partiality,

prejudice, bias or ill[-]will, or arrived at a manifestly unreasonable decision.”

Id. (quoting Commonwealth v. Hoch, 936 A.2d 515, 517-18 (Pa.Super.

2007)).

       Surratt claims that the PCRA court “wholly failed to consider [his]

individual, juvenile characteristics – focusing instead on the details of Surratt’s

crime, improperly considering Surratt as an adult, and weighing the life

sentences imposed on Surratt’s adult co-defendants.” Surratt’s Br. at 18. He

argues it failed to consider his juvenile characteristics as referenced in Miller.

       To begin, the PCRA court was not required to consider the Miller factors.

The Miller2 factors must be considered “when a juvenile is exposed to a

potential sentence of life without the possibility of parole[.]” Commonwealth


____________________________________________


2These factors include such things as “immaturity, impetuosity, and failure to
appreciate risks and consequences; . . .” Batts II, 163 A.3d at 438 (quoting
Miller, 567 U.S. at 477-78).


                                           -4-

v. Machicote, 206 A.3d 1110, 1120 (Pa. 2019); see also Batts II, 163 A.3d

at 432. Here, the Commonwealth did not seek a life-without-parole sentence,

and thus, the court was not required to consider the Miller factors.

Commonwealth v. Lekka, --- A.3d ---, 2019 WL 2064541, at *9 (Pa.Super.

filed May 10, 2019) (“In cases where the Commonwealth does not seek a life-

without-parole sentence, the application of the Miller factors is not required”).

       While Surratt maintains that the PCRA court improperly considered him

an adult, we disagree. The PCRA court conceded it had to reconsider Surratt’s

sentence pursuant to Miller and Montgomery because Surratt was under the

age of 18 at the time of the murders. However, the court observed that the

age of majority was somewhat arbitrary and concluded that, as Surratt was

17½ when he committed the murders, he was relatively mature, as

demonstrated, in part, by his actions during his crimes.3 See N.T., 12/6/17,

____________________________________________


3 The court explained why it believed that Surratt was mature at the
time of committing the murders as follows:

       The Court: And you have to understand how I feel about this
       crime. It may well be that he has completely turned his life
       around, and at least for the sake of argument I will accept that.

       And at the time this happened, we are talking - - the Supreme
       Court case talks about juveniles. There is no question in my mind
       that Mr. Surratt was an adult. I mean, he was six months away
       from 18. He was sophisticated. He had, for the very least, engaged
       in criminal activity for three or four years before this happened. I
       mean, he was running wild. He was running with a bunch of, as
       far as I can tell, criminals. He was a sophisticated person. . . . We
       are not talking about a six-year old, who accidently shoots the



                                           -5-
J-A08035-19


at 111-12. It went on to say, “As I said before, this was a - - for lack of a

better term - - this is the behavior of an adult.” N.T., Reconsideration Hearing,

3/7/18 at 9 (emphasis added). It did not say that he was, in fact, an adult.

This claim is thus meritless.

       Surratt’s additional claim that the court solely considered the facts of

the   crime    without     taking    into      consideration   Surratt’s   potential   for

rehabilitation or his mitigating evidence also fails. He argues that the facts

here are similar to Batts II because there was an improper “significant focus

on the facts of Surratt’s crime . . . to the exclusion of considering his personal

history and development as a juvenile.” Surratt’s Br. at 20. We disagree.

       After Miller and Montgomery, Batts was resentenced to life without

parole. Batts II, 163 A.3d at 450. The Court concluded that because there

was “ample positive support relative to Batts’ potential for rehabilitation[,]”

remand was necessary for the trial court to “‘provide [Batts] some meaningful

opportunity     to   obtain   release    based      on   demonstrated      maturity    and

rehabilitation.’” Id. (quoting Miller, 567 U.S. at 479) (brackets in Batts II).

It found that the trial court’s opinion made clear “that its conclusion that Batts’



____________________________________________


       neighbor, or even a ten-year old who accidently shoots the
       neighbor or accidently does one thing or another. This was a
       planned premeditated - - this is as premeditated as you can
       possibly get.

N.T., 12/6/17, at 111-12.


                                            -6-
J-A08035-19


actions were not the result of his ‘unfortunate yet transient immaturity’ was

based exclusively on the fact that the murder was ‘deliberate and

premedi[t]ated.’” Id. at 446 (quoting Sentencing Court Opinion). The facts

before us are not the same.

      First, at the resentencing, Surratt was not sentenced to life without

parole, but rather two concurrent terms of 40 years’ to life imprisonment.

Second, the PCRA court was within its rights to consider the facts of the case

in fashioning Surratt’s new sentence, as they are one of the permissible

sentencing factors. The Sentencing Code explicitly provides that when

selecting from the statutory sentencing alternatives, “the court shall follow the

general principle that the sentence imposed should call for confinement that

is consistent with the protection of the public, the gravity of the offense as it

relates to the impact on the life of the victim and on the community, and the

rehabilitative needs of the defendant.” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9721(b). The court’s

consideration of the facts of Surratt’s crime was not improper. See

Commonwealth v. Blount, 207 A.3d 925,937-38 (Pa.Super. 2019)

(concluding trial court properly considered Section 9721(b) factors when

resentencing juvenile pursuant to Montgomery and Miller).

      Additionally, the court was made aware of Surratt’s potential for

rehabilitation by Surratt’s sentencing memorandum and letters written in

Surratt’s support. It also heard testimony Surratt offered as mitigating

evidence and received a presentence investigation report (“PSI”). Thus, the


                                      -7-
J-A08035-19


trial court “consider[ed] the particular circumstances of the offense and the

character of [Surratt], with reference to [Surratt’s] prior criminal record, age,

personal characteristic, and potential for rehabilitation,” in fashioning Surratt’s

sentence. Lekka, -- A.3d --, 2019 WL 2064541, at *6 (affirming judgment of

sentence of 45 years to life imprisonment following resentencing hearing);

see also Commonwealth v. Finnecy, 135 A.3d 1028, 1038 (Pa.Super.

2016) (stating that there is an assumption that court is aware of information

provided in PSI, including mitigating factors).

      Surratt also maintains that the PCRA court improperly “weigh[ed] the

life sentences imposed on Surratt’s adult co-defendants.” Surratt’s Br. at 18.

This claim warrants no relief. The court explained that it was concerned about

how the co-defendants’ sentences would compare with Surratt’s sentence.

      [The Court]: There is also the issue, and I brought this up the last
      time we were here, is I have three other people who are going to
      spend the rest of their lives in jail without the possibility of parole
      because of the fact that they were over 18 and they were over the
      artificial line.

N.T., 1/10/18, at 7.

      While the court acknowledged its discomfort in the disparity of

sentences,   it   nonetheless   recognized    that   Surratt   was   not   beyond

rehabilitation and therefore concluded that while his co-defendants received

life without parole, the same was not an appropriate sentence for Surratt. See

Machicote, 206 A.3d at 1115 (stating there is a presumption against a

sentence of life without parole for juvenile and may be rebutted by proving


                                       -8-
J-A08035-19


that juvenile is incapable of rehabilitation); see also Trial Court Opinion, filed

8/29/18, at 4 (stating it “did not find beyond a reasonable doubt, that

[Surratt] is incapable of rehabilitation”).

      Judgment of sentence affirmed.

486 So.2d 855 (1986)
STATE of Louisiana
v.
Michael BURGE.
No. 85 KA 0899.
Court of Appeal of Louisiana, First Circuit.
March 25, 1986.
Rehearing Denied April 29, 1986.
*857 Stephen L. Laiche and William B. Faust, III, Asst. Attys. Gen., New Orleans, for the State.
J. Michael McDonald and David E. Stanley, Baton Rouge, for defendant.
Before GROVER L. COVINGTON, C.J., and WATKINS and SHORTESS, JJ.
WATKINS, Judge.
Michael Burge was originally charged by a single grand jury indictment with three counts of first degree murder. Prior to trial on the merits, the indictment was amended to reduce each charge to second degree murder in violation of LSA-R.S. 14:30.1. Thereafter, defendant withdrew his former plea of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity and entered a plea of not guilty. Following trial by jury, defendnat was convicted on each count as charged by the amended indictment. The trial court sentenced defendant to a term of life imprisonment, without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence, on each count. The sentences for counts one and two are to be served consecutively to each other and to any other sentence defendant *858 is now serving. The sentence for count three is to be served concurrently.
Defendant brings this appeal urging ten assignments of error:
1. The trial court erred in failing to suppress the confession of the defendant.
2. The trial court erred in failing to suppress inflammatory, prejudicial photographs.
3. The trial court erred in not granting a mistrial after two violations of its order of sequestration of witnesses.
4. The trial court erred in failing to grant a mistrial after the misconduct and harassment of defense witnesses by the state.
5. The trial court erred in failing to grant a mistrial after harassment by the state of the defendant.
6. The trial court erred in failing to grant a mistrial after improper conduct of the prosecution by referring to a nickname of the defendant in violation of court order.
7. The trial court erred in failing to grant a judgment of acquittal.
8. The trial court erred in failing to grant a mistrial or a new trial because of the cumulative prejudicial effect of the acts of the state and prosecution.
9. The trial court erred in failing to grant a mistrial or seat an alternate juror when a juror viewed the defendant shackled.
10. The trial court erred in admitting into evidence the autopsy report of Dr. Cavalier.
It is conceded by defendant that, shortly after midnight on a Sunday night, he fatally stabbed Ricky Gray, Mark Vincent and Lester Allen with a knife fashioned from a sharpened file. A fourth individual, Darryl Washington, was also stabbed by defendant, but he survived.[1] At the time of the instant offenses, defendant and the victims were all inmates of Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, housed in Magnolia 3 dormitory.
Magnolia 3 dormitory is a prison structure capable of housing sixty inmates, who sleep in one large room with their individual beds arranged side by side in several long rows. Prison personnel characterize the facility as an appropriate placement for an inmate who is not easily integrated into the general prison population.
After making a formal request for protection because of difficulties encountered in another placement at Angola, defendant was moved to Magnolia 3 dormitory some six weeks before the stabbing incident occurred. Robert Shriver was already housed in that facility. Shriver and defendant, both white inmates, subsequently developed a homosexual relationship. Antagonism developed between defendant and Shriver and a group of several black inmates, which included the instant victims. One of those inmates, Larry Thomas, testified that he and Lester Allen broke the lock on Shriver's locker box during the Friday preceding the stabbing incident and stole several items. Larry Thomas admitted that defendant asked to have half of his and Shriver's things returned; however, Thomas was unwilling or unable to comply. Thomas maintains that defendant threatened to recover his property "one way or another." Warren Cain, an inmate who testified for the state, claims to have overheard a conversation among defendant, Shriver, Lester Allen and Mark Vincent during the afternoon immediately preceding the stabbing incident. Cain characterized Allen's and Vincent's response to defendant's request to have his property returned as one of indifference. Defendant was advised to seek return of his property whatever way he wanted.
Defendant and defense witnesses, Al Bates and Aubrey Thompson, maintain that, when questioned about returning defendant's property, Lester Allen advised defendant to get a knife or "check out." However, defendant testified that he did not request a transfer from Magnolia 3 dormitory because he did not want to be separated from Shriver. Rather, defendant *859 retrieved a homemade knife from the prison recreation yard, brought it inside the dormitory, and hid it with his belongings.
On Sunday night in Magnolia 3 dormitory, lights were turned off at 10:00 p.m.; and the dormitory television was turned off at midnight. All inmates were expected to be in bed by midnight. James Slaven, the correctional officer on duty when the stabbing incident occurred, made a head count at 12:30 a.m. Officer Slaven recalled that defendant, Shriver, and Warren Cain were all awake when that count was made. While Officer Slaven was in the shower room reporting his head count, four inmates were stabbed. When the lights were turned on, Officer Slaven observed defendant standing by his bed with a knife in his hand. Defendant's knife, in reality a sharpened file, was held in place by a glove or by gauze wrapped around his hand. No other weapons were found in the dormitory "shake down" following this incident. As defendant was escorted from the dormitory, he remarked to Captain John Purpera of the prison security staff, "I stabbed all four of them."
Accounts of the stabbing incident differ greatly. Inmates Warren Cain and Mark Duhon testified that they saw defendant get out of his bed and proceed to stab Ricky Gray and Mark Vincent as they lay in bed. Gray occupied a bed immediately adjacent to defendant's bed. Vincent's bed was located on the other side of Gray's bed. While Gray and Vincent were being stabbed, Shriver went to Lester Allen's bed and hit Allen with a sock containing batteries. With Gray and Vincent immobilized, defendant went to Shriver's assistance. Defendant stabbed Allen and in the process disturbed Darryl Washington, who occupied the bed immediately adjacent to Allen's bed. Washington was stabbed several times but managed to grab a radio which he hurled against a post.
Robert Shriver acknowledged that he had a sock filled with batteries and was also aware that defendant had brought a knife into the dormitory. He claims ignorance as to Ricky Gray's or Mark Vincent's role in the fight. Rather, Shriver contends that the fight began when Lester Allen approached his bed and said, "Come on and do something for me." In response to that proposition, Shriver got out of his bed, which was positioned end on end relative to defendant's bed, and struck Allen with the sock full of batteries. Defendant came to Shriver's assistance.
Defendant's version of the incident is supported in part by the testimony of fellow inmates, Al Bates, Aubrey Thompson and Donald Fontenot. Defendant maintains that when Shriver and Allen first started arguing he put on a glove and placed the homemade knife in his left hand. Defendant denied utilizing any tape or gauze to wrap his hand. When defendant got up to help Shriver, he was attacked by Ricky Gray and Mark Vincent. Gray had a knife in his right hand, and Vincent appeared unarmed. Defendant grabbed Gray's right hand; and defendant, Gray and Vincent fell onto a bed. Defendant described his encounter with Gray and Vincent: "[W]e was kinda rassling (sic), all three of us on the bed, standing up, falling back down, and I was just stabbing." After Gray and Vincent were incapacitated, defendant intervened in the fight between Shriver and Allen. Defendant stabbed Allen "once or twice". Defendant did not know if Allen had a weapon.
Defendant and Shriver were neither bruised nor cut as a result of the incident. Dr. Emile Laga performed autopsies on Ricky Gray and Mark Vincent. Dr. Laga noted that Gray had four stab wounds to the upper, left half of his body. One deep wound penetrated the front wall of his heart. No defensive injuries were found on Gray's extremities. Dr. Laga was certain that the assailant and Gray had been face to face when Gray was stabbed, and he hypothesized that Gray might have been in a supine position. Vincent suffered two stab wounds to his chest. Again, one wound penetrated the cardial sac, and Dr. Laga was certain that the assailant and Vincent had been face to face when Vincent was stabbed.
*860 Dr. Debra Cavalier, who performed the autopsy of Lester Allen, noted two stab wounds, one positioned in the mid-abdomen and the other on Allen's right side. Allen also had two cuts on his face and a laceration on his forehead. Again, no defensive wounds were located on Allen's hand or forearms, and Dr. Cavalier opined that Allen and his assailant had been face to face during the attack.

ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER 1:
By this assignment, defendant contends that the trial court erred by failing to suppress a written statement made by him. Defendant argues that his written statement was tainted because prior to making that statement he had been taken into custody and orally questioned about the incident without having been advised of his Miranda rights. In addition, defendant contends that his written statement was involuntary because he was not advised by his interrogators, prior to making that statement, that any of the victims of the stabbing incident had died.
Testimony from the hearing on the motion to suppress reveals that a series of oral statements was made by defendant after he was escorted from the interior of Magnolia 3 dormitory. The first statement was to Captain John Purpera of the prison security force. As defendant was being led from the crime scene, he spontaneously remarked to Captain Purpera, who had just arrived on the scene, "I got all four of them." The trial court found that Captain Purpera had asked no questions, that defendant's statement was freely and voluntarily given, and, thereby, it was admissible at trial. Defendant does not contest that ruling on appeal.
Defendant was then handcuffed and placed in custody as the suspect of a homicide by Lieutenant Dallas Constance. From that point in time, defendant was in the immediate and personal control of an officer. Accordingly, his freedom was restricted beyond that of an ordinary inmate. Without advising defendant of his Miranda rights, Lt. Constance asked defendant why he had stabbed a fellow inmate. Defendant replied that he had stabbed four inmates. The trial court suppressed defendant's statement to Lt. Constance, finding that any questioning at that point should have been preceded by advising defendant of his constitutional rights. That particular ruling is not contested; however, defendant urges that the circumstances surrounding the giving of that statement, and an oral statement to Warden Ross Maggio, served to taint his later written statement.
According to his testimony at the hearing on the motion to suppress, Warden Maggio first spoke with defendant about 1:00 a.m. on the walkway outside Magnolia 3 dormitory. Warden Maggio stated that the primary focus of this conversation with defendant was to determine if any inmates, who remained in Magnolia 3 dormitory, were in danger because of the stabbing incident. Without advising defendant of his Miranda rights, Warden Maggio asked defendant what had happened. Defendant testified at the hearing that he answered Warden Maggio's questions because he wanted to explain the incident. Defendant did not feel compelled to answer. Defendant's response to this questioning was described as detailing the same basic sequence of events which defendant later set forth in his written statement. The trial court did not rule on the admissibility of defendant's oral statement to Warden Maggio because the state indicated that it would not seek to introduce it at trial.
At approximately 2:40 a.m., defendant was taken to Capt. Purpera's office. In the presence of Deputy Ivy Cutrer of the St. Francisville Sheriff's Office, Assistant Warden Prentice Butler, Deputy Warden C.M. Lensing, and Warden Ross Maggio, defendant was fully advised of his Miranda rights and executed a written waiver. Thereafter, defendant detailed the antagonism which existed among various inmates housed at Magnolia 3 dormitory and outlined the scenario which culminated in *861 the instant stabbing incident.[2] Handwritten notes of defendant's oral statement were taken by Deputy Warden Lensing and prepared in typed form. At approximately 3:30 a.m., defendant read and signed the typed statement, which was ruled admissible by the trial court and introduced into evidence by the state.
In written reasons for judgment on the motion to suppress, the trial court relied on Oregon v. Elstad, ___ U.S. ___, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 84 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985), in rejecting defendant's contention that his written statement was tainted by the earlier unadvised questioning of Lt. Constance and Warden Maggio.
The United States Supreme Court recently decided in Oregon v. Elstad, supra, that a careful and thorough administration of Miranda warnings may cure the condition that rendered previous unwarned statements inadmissible.[3] The Miranda warning, itself, when properly administered, conveys the relevant information and thereafter a suspect's choice whether or not to exercise a privilege to remain silent should ordinarily be viewed as an act of free will. The United States Supreme Court reasoned that there is no basis for presuming coercive effect where the suspect's initial inculpatory statement, although technically in violation of Miranda, was voluntary.
In the instant case, defendant acknowledged during the hearing on the motion to suppress that he did not feel compelled to answer Warden Maggio's initial questions. Defendant also admitted that he was anxious to explain his side of the incident. We do not find that Warden Maggio's initial questioning of defendant was coercive or a deliberately conceived improper tactic to obtain defendant's initial statement. At that point in time, Warden Maggio's primary concern was to protec those inmates remaining in Magnolia 3 dormitory. The scene was one of confusion following a violent confrontation which left three inmates dead. Cf. New York v. Quarles, 467 U.S. 649, 104 S.Ct. 2626, 81 L.Ed.2d 550 (1984).
As Justice O'Connor explained in Oregon v. Elstad, supra:
It is an unwarranted extension of Miranda to hold that a simple failure to administer the warnings, unaccompanied by any actual coercion or other circumstances calculated to undermine the suspect's ability to exercise his free will so taints the investigatory process that a subsequent voluntary and informed waiver is ineffective for some indeterminate period. Though Miranda requires that the unwarned admission must be suppressed, the admissibility of any subsequent statement should turn in these circumstances solely on whether it is knowingly and voluntarily made.
105 S.Ct. at 1293-1294.
Therefore, under Oregon v. Elstad, the relevant inquiry to be made in determining *862 whether a post-Miranda statement is admissible is whether it was voluntarily made. In addition, Louisiana statutory law requires that, before a confession or inculpatory statement may be introduced in evidence, the state must prove affirmatively and beyond a reasonable doubt that the statement was free and voluntary, and not made under the influence of fear, duress, intimidation, menaces, threats, inducements or promises. LSA-R.S. 15:451; La.C.Cr.P. art. 703(G); State v. Nathan, 444 So.2d 231 (La.App. 1st Cir.1983), cert. denied, 445 So.2d 1232 (La.1984).
In this context, defendant argues that the action of the interrogating officers in withholding knowledge of the inmates' deaths constituted a form of inducement or coercion, rendering his written statement inadmissible as not being freely and voluntarily made.
Once a defendant alleges specific instances of police misconduct in reference to a statement, it is incumbent upon the state to specifically rebut each instance. State v. James, 459 So.2d 28 (La.App. 1st Cir.1984). The trial court's conclusions on credibility are entitled to the respect due those made by one who saw the witnesses and heard them testify. State v. Collins, 470 So.2d 549 (La.App. 1st Cir.1985). The decision of the trial court on the question of whether the confession was voluntarily given is entitled to great weight and will not be overturned on appeal unless it is not supported by the evidence. State v. Haynie, 395 So.2d 669 (La.1981).
At the hearing on the motion to suppress, defendant testified that he inquired about the health status of the inmates he had stabbed. Only Warden Maggio recalled discussing that topic with defendant. In response to defendant's inquiry, Warden Maggio advised defendant that he was not fully aware of the condition of those inmates. However, he noted that defendant was positioned in such a location that he would have been able to see medical personnel moving at least one inmate's body from the interior of the dormitory. In written reasons for judgment, the trial court noted: "... by the sheer brutality of the stabbing attacks, Burge was fully aware of the high probability that one or all of the victims would die as a result."
Assuming for the sake of argument, that defendant did not know the fatal effect of the wounds he had inflicted upon his fellow inmates, this fact alone would not compel a conclusion that defendant's statement was not freely and voluntarily made. Cf. State v. James, supra. The Louisiana Supreme Court has established that the central determination of voluntariness is whether the statement was the product of the defendant's free and rational choice. State v. Richey, 364 So.2d 566 (La.1978). Making that determination requires an examination of the totality of the circumstances. Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S. 477, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981).
Defendant knew at the least that his victims were in extremely serious condition after having been stabbed by him a number of times. He was also aware of the illegal nature of his act. The record supports the conclusion that defendant fully understood his rights and the consequences of waiving them. Defendant's statement was the product of his free and rational choice, despite the fact that he may not have had knowledge of the fatal effects of his criminal actions. In light of all the circumstances, the record supports the trial court's conclusion that the defendant's statement was freely and voluntarily made and thus admissible.
Moreover, since defendant's testimony at trial is free of any constitutional taint and of equal cast with his prior inculpatory statement, we find admission of his statement, even if improper, was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. La.C. Cr.P. art. 921. See, State v. Robertson, 464 So.2d 760 (La.App. 1st Cir.1984), writ denied, 467 So.2d 534 (La.1985).
ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER 2:
By means of this assignment, defendant contends that the trial court erred by failing *863 to suppress inflammatory, prejudicial photographs depicting the victims and the crime scene.
The admission of allegedly gruesome photographs will not be overturned unless it is clear that the prejudicial effect of the photographs outweighs their probative value. State v. Johnson, 475 So.2d 394 (La.App. 1st Cir.1985), writ denied, 478 So.2d 143 (La.1985). Photographs which illustrate any fact, shed light upon any fact or issue in the case, or are relevant to describe the person, place or thing depicted, are generally admissible. State v. Kirkpatrick, 443 So.2d 546 (La.1983), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 993, 104 S.Ct. 2374, 80 L.Ed.2d 847 (1984).
The record indicates that the trial court closely examined each photograph submitted at the hearing on the motion to suppress, rejecting those which were repetitious or of little probative value. After examining the contested photographs, we find no error in the trial court's ruling that the probative value of those admitted photographs outweighs any prejudicial effect. Accordingly, these photographs were properly admitted over defense counsel's objection.
This assignment of error is without merit.
ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER 3:
By this assignment, defendant contends that the trial court erred by failing to grant a mistrial after the state violated the witness sequestration order on two different occasions.
In the first instance, the record reveals that during the course of the trial, defense counsel noted of record that he had personally observed the prosecutor meeting with several prospective witnesses during a noontime recess. The witnesses in attendance were identified by the prosecutor as Dr. Emile Laga and Dr. Debra Cavalier. Dr. Laga performed the autopsies on Ricky Gray and Mark Vincent, and Dr. Cavalier performed the autopsy on Lester Allen. The prosecutor admitted that he had met with these two physicians and others; however, he maintained that each autopsy was discussed on an individual basis with the respective physician. Dr. Laga had just taken the witness stand when the objection was voiced and, outside the presence of the jury, confirmed the prosecutor's characterization of the meeting. Dr. Laga also testified that his prospective testimony was not influenced by that meeting. In denying the defense motion, the trial court relied on Dr. Laga's testimony and the fact that the witnesses at issue had been called to testify as medical experts.
In the second instance, defense counsel noted of record that defendant's father, Al Burge, had observed the prosecutor engaged in conversation with two state witnesses, Lt. Constance and Capt. Purpera, during a noontime recess prior to their testifying at trial. Under examination by the trial court, the prosecutor stated that he had not told either witness about testimony of prior witnesses but had asked each officer individually, in the presence of the other officer, about policy on transferring an inmate within the Louisiana State Penitentiary. At the time of defense counsel's objection, both officers had already testified during trial on the merits. The trial court noted that each officer's testimony had been of a limited nature and substantially the same as his respective testimony during the hearing on the motion to suppress defendant's confession. Finding no particular breach, the trial court denied defendant's motion.
Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure article 764 provides for sequestration of witnesses upon the court's own motion or upon request of the state or of the defense. The purpose of sequestration is to assure that a witness will testify as to his own knowledge of events, to prevent the testimony of one from influencing the testimony of others, and to strengthen the role of cross-examination in developing facts. State v. Nolan, 457 So.2d 1246 (La. App. 1st Cir.1984), writ denied, 462 So.2d 190 (La.1984). It is within the sound discretion of the trial court to permit witnesses who have violated the order to testify.
*864 This may be done where the purpose of the sequestration order has not been thwarted or there is no evidence that the witness's testimony has been tainted. Id.
We find no prejudice to defendant arising from the trial court's application of the sequestration rule in this case. There is no evidence that any witness' testimony was tainted by the prosecutor's casual approach to the sequestration order. Dr. Laga and Dr. Cavalier testified as expert witnesses called to address different factual considerations. Although Lt. Constance and Capt. Purpera were questioned about internal transfer of inmates, the subject matter of the group meeting, this was not "a major issue in the case" as defendant contends in brief. Defendant, himself, freely admitted during his testimony at trial that he had not sought to be transferred from Magnolia 3 Dormitory because he did not want to be separated from Robert Shriver. Defendant was not concerned that procedural obstacles attendant to requesting that relief would have served to thwart his efforts.
For the foregoing reasons, this assignment of error is without merit.
ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR NUMBERS 4 AND 5:
By means of these assignments, defendant contends that the trial court erred in failing to grant a mistrial due to harassment of the defendant and defense witnesses by the state.
The alleged harassment is based on the assertion that defendant and defense witnesses, Wayne Martin and Daniel Holmes, were moved by Louisiana State Penitentiary personnel to administrative lockdown, i.e., a cell block situation, several days prior to commencement of trial on the merits. Before these individuals testified at trial, defense counsel noted his objection of record citing possible prejudice "if these people come to court and don't want to testify because the power of the State has been brought upon them."
However, the record reveals that defense counsel's fears were not realized. Wayne Martin and Daniel Holmes each testified fully as to his knowledge of relevant circumstances surrounding the incident. On cross-examination, each admitted that his testimony at trial was not adversely affected by his transfer within the penitentiary. Defendant also took the stand on his own behalf. In detailing the relationship between Robert Shriver and Lester Allen, defendant noted they had, at one time, been housed together in the "dungeon". In defining the term "dungeon", defendant provided: "It is [sic] proper term would be administrative lockdown. It is where they put you when you [sic] waiting to go to court, or you have a rule infraction or you check out." Thus, contrary to defense counsel's voiced concerns, defendant apparently perceived placement in administrative lockdown as a routine administrative procedure which might be implemented prior to an inmate's courtroom appearance.
The record clearly reveals that the anticipated prejudicial impact did not materialize. In addition, it was not demonstrated that internal movement of these prisoners was grounded on any consideration other than appropriate operation of the penal system. Under these circumstances, these assignments of error are without merit.
ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER 6:
By this assignment, defendant contends that the trial court erred by failing to grant a mistrial following improper comment by the prosecutor, who referred to defendant's nickname in violation of a court order.
The record reveals that defendant filed a motion in limine seeking inter alia to prevent the state from referring to defendant's prison nickname of "Iron Mike" in the presence of the jury. During the hearing on that motion, the prosecutor suggested that a definitive ruling be deferred. Thereafter, the trial court noted: "If his (defendant's) character is at issue, I'm not going to try to prevent that. If his character is not at issue, I'll instruct the State not to use that nickname."
During cross-examination of defendant, the prosecutor asked defendant his nickname after defendant acknowledged that *865 he was regarded as a strong inmate. Before defendant could respond, defense counsel objected; and the trial court sustained the objection. No further relief was sought.
If an objection is sustained, defendant cannot on appeal complain of the alleged error unless at trial he requested and was denied either an admonition to disregard or a mistrial. State v. Michel, 422 So.2d 1115 (La.1982). Moreover, assuming for the purpose of argument that the prosecutor's question was improper, the general rule regarding reversible error due to improper questioning requires a clear showing that the matters complained of are of such an extremely prejudicial nature that defendant was deprived of a fair and impartial trial. See, State v. Morris, 404 So.2d 1186 (La.1981).
In this instance, no such showing was made. The prosecutor's question did not reveal defendant's nickname. In addition, through defendant's opening statement, the jury learned that prisoners routinely referred to each other by nicknames. Thus, the fact that defendant was known by a nickname was entirely customary. In view of the foregoing, this assignment of error is without merit.
ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER 7:
By means of this assignment, defendant contends that the trial court erred by failing to grant his motion for post-verdict judgment of acquittal.
Defendant acknowledges that he stabbed his fellow inmates and that the stab wounds caused their deaths. It is defendant's contention that he was justified in killing Ricky Gray, Mark Vincent, and Lester Allen in self-defense or in defense of Robert Shriver.
A defendant in a homicide prosecution who asserts that he acted in self-defense does not have the burden of proof on that issue because the state bears the burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that the homicide was not perpetrated in self-defense. State v. Brown, 414 So.2d 726 (La.1982). LSA-R.S. 14:20, in pertinent part, provides: "A homicide is justifiable: (1) when committed in self-defense by one who reasonably believes he is in imminent danger of losing his life or receiving great bodily harm and that killing is necessary to save himself from that danger...." It is also justifiable "to kill in the defense of another person when it is reasonably apparent that the person attacked could have justifiably used such means himself, and when it is reasonably believed that such intervention is necessary to protect the other person." LSA-R.S. 14:22. However, an aggressor or one who brings on difficulty, as a general rule, cannot claim the right of self-defense unless he withdraws from the conflict in good faith and indicates his intention of abandoning the difficulty. LSA-R.S. 14:21. The relevant inquiry on appeal is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the homicide was not committed in self-defense. State v. Brown, supra.
As often happens, eyewitnesses presented the jury with conflicting accounts of the incident. Defense witnesses suggest that defendant was initially attacked by Ricky Gray and Mark Vincent and while wrestling with both men, he stabbed each man several times. State witnesses, Warren Cain and Mark Duhon, testified that they saw defendant get out of his bed and proceed to stab Ricky Gray and Mark Vincent, who were lying in adjacent beds. This account was corroborated by forensic evidence detailing the situs of the wounds and by the lack of evidence suggesting a struggle.
The trier of fact is free to accept or reject in whole or in part, the testimony of any witness. State v. Richardson, 459 So.2d 31 (La.App. 1st Cir.1984). Apparently, the jury exercised its lawful prerogative and chose to believe the outline of events presented by the state. Moreover, Shriver's own account of his and defendant's confrontation with Lester Allen fails to *866 support justification for stabbing the unarmed Allen. Shriver testified that he answered Allen's proposition by striking Allen with a sock filled with batteries. By the time defendant intervened in that fist fight, Allen had already fallen back onto his bed and had stopped fighting, thereby negating justification for use of deadly force.
The law cannot permit even a harassed and threatened inmate of a penal institution to take the law into his own hands, arm himself, attack his enemy with a knife, and then, because of prior threats, claim justification for a homicide which follows. After consideration of all the state's evidence, we conclude that any reasonable trier of fact could have found that the state carried its burden in establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that the homicides of Ricky Gray, Mark Vincent, and Lester Allen were not committed in self-defense or in defense of Robert Shriver.
For the foregoing reasons, this assignment of error is without merit.
ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER 9:
By means of this assignment, defendant contends that the trial court erred by failing to grant a mistrial or to seat an alternate juror after one juror viewed defendant shackled.
The record reveals that, during the course of the instant trial, defense counsel noted of record that he had observed one of the jurors downstairs in the courthouse waiting for transportation home after trial had been adjourned for the day. As that juror waited, defendant was brought downstairs in handcuffs and shackles to be transported from the courthouse to Louisiana State Penitentiary at AngoLa.Defendant moved for a mistrial on the basis of this inadvertent sighting. In denying the defense motion, the trial court acknowledged that it too had observed the juror waiting for transportation. However, at that point in the trial, the jury was already fully aware of defendant's status as an inmate of the Louisiana State Penitentiary at AngoLa.The trial court weighed the need for security in transporting defendant and the juror's prior knowledge of defendant's inmate status in determining that the inadvertent sighting did not prejudice defendant.
We find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a mistrial. Under the circumstances, the possibility that on one occasion a juror may have seen the defendant shackled does not appear to have so prejudiced defendant as to warrant relief on appeal. Mistrial is a drastic remedy and should only be granted on a showing of substantial prejudice. State v. Murphy, 463 So.2d 812 (La.App. 2d Cir.1985), writ denied, 468 So.2d 570 (La. 1985). There is no showing that defendant's presumption of innocence was destroyed or that any juror was influenced by seeing defendant in handcuffs and shackles.
Accordingly, this assignment of error is without merit.
ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER 10:
By means of this assignment, defendant contends that the trial court erred by admitting into evidence the autopsy report of Lester Allen prepared by Dr. Cavalier.
The record reveals that following the examination of Dr. Cavalier the state sought to introduce into evidence the autopsy report of Lester Allen. Defendant grounded his contemporaneous objection to its admission on an allegation that the state had failed to provide him with a copy of that report in response to defendant's discovery request. Following a bench conference held off the record, the trial court overruled the objection finding that the state's failure to furnish the report was inadvertent and that defendant was neither surprised nor prejudiced by this omission.
The state's failure to comply with discovery procedures will not automatically demand a reversal. See La.C.Cr.P. art. 729.5; State v. Faulkner, 447 So.2d 1139 (La.App. 1st Cir.1984), writ denied, 449 So.2d 1345 (La.1984), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 105 S.Ct. 164, 83 L.Ed.2d 100 (1984). We agree with the trial court's reasoning *867 and find no undue surprise or prejudice. Before trial, defense counsel was aware of, and sought to take advantage of, the inadvertent error. Defense counsel was aware prior to trial testimony of Dr. Cavalier that she had performed the autopsy on Lester Allen. [See assignment of error number three.] In addition, existence of the autopsy report was revealed during direct examination of Dr. Cavalier. Rather than seeking a recess, defense counsel chose to vigorously participate in examination of that witness.
Under these circumstances, we find this assignment of error without merit.
ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER 8:
By this assignment, defendant urges that the cumulative effect of the above referenced errors was so prejudicial as to preclude defendant's receiving a fair trial.
For reasons more fully set forth in our treatment of defendant's other arguments urged on appeal, we find this assignment of error meritless.
The conviction and sentence are therefore affirmed.
CONVICTION AND SENTENCE AFFIRMED.
NOTES
[1]  The attack on Darryl Washington does not form a part of this prosecution.
[2]  In pertinent part, defendant stated that after Robert Shriver and Lester Allen started fighting he got up from his bed and retrieved a knife from his pillow. Defendant intervened in the fight between Shriver and Allen. Defendant stabbed Allen "a couple of times". Defendant was attacked by Ricky Gray and Mark Vincent and also stabbed each of those inmates "a couple of times".
[3]  We note that by adoption of Article I, § 13 of the 1974 Louisiana Constitution, Louisiana incorporated the prophylactic rules of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). See State In The Interest of Dino, 359 So.2d 586 (La.1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1047, 99 S.Ct. 722, 58 L.Ed.2d 706 (1978). Decisions of the United States Supreme Court, although given careful consideration, do not necessarily control or dictate decisions by Louisiana courts construing the Louisiana Constitution, nor replace the independent judgment of the Louisiana courts so long as the state decisions do not infringe on federal constitutional rights. The decision of Oregon v. Elstad is well grounded in law and supported by strong policy considerations. It advances the legitimate interests of the criminal justice system without sacrificing the individual rights guaranteed by the constitution. Exercising the independent judgment of this Louisiana court, we adopt the Oregon v. Elstad holding (that a voluntary unwarned statement in a non-coercive environment does not "taint" a subsequent statement made after full warnings and waiver) as applicable to cases arising under Article I, § 13 of the Louisiana Constitution, for the sound reasons set forth in the majority opinion of the United States Supreme Court.

                            ORDER AND JUDGMENT *


Before TYMKOVICH and BALDOCK, Circuit Judges, and BRORBY, Senior
Circuit Judge.


*
       After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined
unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of
this appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is
therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is
not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata,
and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value
consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.
      Clarence E. Grissom, Jr., a Kansas state prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals

from the dismissal of his civil rights action. We have jurisdiction under

28 U.S.C. § 1291 and affirm.

I.    BACKGROUND

      Mr. Grissom filed an action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The district court

screened his form complaint and numerous other filings under 28 U.S.C. § 1915A

and entered a screening order. In that order, the district court identified three

claims in his form complaint: (1) use of excessive force on August 27, 2008, at

the El Dorado Correctional Facility; (2) denial of medical care for injuries

sustained during that incident; and (3) creation of a false disciplinary report to

cover up the incident.

      These claims were based on the following allegations. Defendants Daniel

A. Jackson and C. Castlman, both correctional officers, told Mr. Grissom to come

to his cell door to be restrained while they removed his wheelchair. Mr. Grissom

resisted the order, responded obscenely, and threw water at Officer Jackson.

Officer Jackson, who knew that Mr. Grissom suffers from chronic obstructive

pulmonary disease, used pepper spray on him. Officer Jackson then called a

“Condition 30,” which resulted in the arrival of a team of correctional officers.

Unidentified members of that team hit Mr. Grissom with an electric shield while

he was in his wheelchair, then forcibly removed him from his cell and carried him

                                         -2-
to the shower, where they held him under hot water. He sustained a broken nose

and facial bruises.

      Thereafter, Mr. Grissom was laid down, his underwear was cut off, and he

was rolled onto his side so that defendant Bokor, an advanced registered nurse

practitioner (A.R.N.P.), could administer an albuterol inhaler. A.R.N.P. Bokor

looked at his face but provided no treatment. The next day, both of his eyes were

black and blue, and his right eye was swollen shut. He requested medical

treatment but was denied. Later, Officer Jackson, Officer Castlman, and A.R.N.P.

Bokor created an allegedly false disciplinary report to justify their actions,

charging Mr. Grissom with battery and disobeying orders. Mr. Grissom was

found guilty and given sixty days of disciplinary segregation, forty dollars in

fines, and ninety days “‘L.G.T.’” R. at 167. 1 Based on these allegations,

Mr. Grissom requested damages and the termination of defendants’ employment.

      In its screening analysis, the district court first concluded that it lacked

power to order that any defendants be fired. The court also determined that

Mr. Grissom’s request that he be permitted to use his wheelchair while in

segregation, which was set forth in an attachment to his form complaint, was

improperly joined, identified no named defendant, and stated no supporting facts.

The court further concluded that for the same reasons, still other claims, scattered

throughout the attachments to his complaint and other filings, were improperly

1
      Apparently, “L.G.T.” means “loss of good time.”

                                          -3-
raised. The court informed Mr. Grissom that it would not consider any claims

referred to only in his attachments, and that instead, he must file an amended

complaint in order to add claims or defendants; motions, exhibits, or other papers

were not proper for that purpose. The court also provided him an overview of

joinder under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

      The district court then dismissed two defendants, Correct Care Solutions

and the El Dorado Minimum Clinic, because neither was a “person” for § 1983

purposes, a necessary element of a § 1983 claim. Id. at 176 (citing Will v. Mich.

Dep’t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 66, 71 (1989)). Further, the court pointed out

that Mr. Grissom failed to adequately identify the personal participation of

defendants Roberts, McNickle, Thompkins, or Sherman. See R. at 176 (citing,

inter alia, Trujillo v. Williams, 465 F.3d 1210, 1227 (10th Cir. 2006)). Thus, the

court gave Mr. Grissom an opportunity to file a supplemental complaint alleging

the necessary participation.

      The district court also instructed Mr. Grissom that a supplemental

complaint was necessary to correct other shortcomings in his pleadings. As to his

excessive force claim, the court reasoned that Mr. Grissom’s own statements and

exhibits showed that “he was combative, disruptive, and very disrespectful”; he

refused to obey orders”; he “had a history of battering or attempting to batter

correctional officers”; and he “refused to be restrained and had thrown a cup of

water on Jackson.” R. at 179-80. “Under such circumstances,” the court

                                         -4-
concluded, “the use of some physical force such as pepper spray can hardly be

considered repugnant to the conscience of mankind.” Id. at 180. 1 Moreover, the

court noted that Mr. Grissom had not alleged severe pain or lasting injury as a

result of the pepper spray, as required under Sampley v. Ruettgers, 704 F.2d 491,

495 (10th Cir. 1983). Therefore, the court concluded, Mr. Grissom had not

advanced sufficient factual allegations to show an Eighth Amendment violation

based on Officer Jackson’s use of pepper spray or his call for a Condition 30.

      Turning to the physical injuries Mr. Grissom alleged were caused by the

forced removal from his cell, the district court observed that he had not described

acts by any specific defendant that caused those injuries. Rather, he alleged he

was beaten by a team of correctional officers. Therefore, the court permitted him

to file a supplemental complaint to provide additional factual allegations of

personal participation by named defendants.

      The district court next concluded that Mr. Grissom’s allegations did not

support his claim that he was denied medical treatment in violation of the Eighth

Amendment. Mr. Grissom’s filings indicated that A.R.N.P. Bokor immediately

gave him an albuterol inhaler and examined his broken nose and facial injuries.

Mr. Grissom did “not describe any additional treatment as having been prescribed

or obviously necessary for his broken nose or facial abrasions” or “any


1
      The district court apparently drew this standard from a line of Supreme
Court cases discussed in Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 105-06 (1976).

                                        -5-
‘substantial harm’ suffered as a result of any delay in treating his broken nose or

facial injuries.” Id. at 184 (applying standards set out in Ramos v. Lamm,

639 F.2d 559, 575 (10th Cir. 1980), and Garrett v. Stratman, 254 F.3d 946, 950

(10th Cir. 2001)). Nor had he identified the officer who denied his request for

medical treatment the next day as one of the named defendants. Again, the

district court instructed Mr. Grissom that he could file a supplemental complaint

to remedy these deficiencies.

      The district court further concluded that Mr. Grissom’s claim that Officers

Jackson and Castlman and A.R.N.P. Bokor filed a false disciplinary report could

be raised only in a writ of habeas corpus because it “involve[d] good time and the

possibility of entitlement to a speedier release.” R. at 185 (citing Preiser v.

Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475 (1973)). The court also reasoned that Mr. Grissom could

not recover damages on this claim unless he could show that his conviction of the

charged offenses was “‘invalidated.’” R. at 186 (quoting Heck v. Humphrey,

512 U.S. 477, 487 (1994), and citing Edwards v. Balisok, 520 U.S. 641 (1997),

for its extension of Heck to loss of good time credit in prison setting)). 2

      Based on its analysis, the district court gave Mr. Grissom thirty days in

which to file a supplemental complaint. Mr. Grissom filed a timely supplement,

2
       Mr. Grissom also filed two motions requesting an injunction or a temporary
restraining order with regard to the conditions of his later confinement at a
different correctional facility. The court denied the motions on the ground that
neither one provided a sufficient factual or legal basis for such relief.
Mr. Grissom has not challenged these denials on appeal.

                                           -6-
and he also filed numerous other papers outside the allotted time. The district

court reviewed all of these filings and concluded that Mr. Grissom had not

remedied the deficiencies in his complaint and had ignored most of the directions

in the court’s screening order. The court found no mention of defendants

McNickle, Thompkins, or Sherman in any of the additional filings, and no

allegation that defendant Roberts had personally participated in any of the events

underlying the three claims set out in the initial form complaint. Thus, the court

dismissed the claims as to these defendants. Similarly, the court could find no

specification of “which named defendant, if any, took acts that actually caused

the injuries to his nose and face during [the] forced [cell] move.” R. at 490-91.

Nor did the court find any additional allegations showing “either that [Officer]

Jackson used more force than was reasonably necessary under the[] circumstances

or that [he] applied the pepper spray and called a Condition 30 other than in a

‘good faith effort’ to restore institutional order.” Id. at 491. 3 Accordingly, the

district court dismissed the excessive force claim without prejudice for failure to

state a claim on which relief may be granted.

      The district court next concluded that Mr. Grissom failed to remedy the

deficiencies in his claim that he was denied medical treatment. Although he

appeared to claim that Officer Jackson had denied his request to see A.R.N.P.


3
      The district court apparently was relying on Sampley, 704 F.2d at 495,
which it had cited in its screening order, see R. at 178.

                                          -7-
Bokor, he also stated that he had another inmate contact A.R.N.P. Bokor, who

said there was nothing she could do “‘to fix [his] broken nose because it ha[d]

been broken twice before and it wouldn’t do any good to fix it.’” Id. at 493

(quoting Supplement to Complaint, id. at 192). The court determined that this

concession, read in light of Mr. Grissom’s continued failure “to allege that any

particular treatment was prescribed or medically necessary for his broken nose

beyond the immediate examination that was provided,” id. at 493, indicated

nothing more than a difference of opinion on a matter of medical judgment, which

is not actionable under the Eighth Amendment, see Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S.

97, 106-07 (1976). Consequently, Officer Jackson’s alleged denial of

Mr. Grissom’s request for treatment also failed to state a claim under the Eighth

Amendment. Therefore, the district court dismissed the claim of denial of

medical treatment.

      The court next considered a multitude of claims described in the numerous

filings Mr. Grissom submitted in response to the screening order, concluding that

none of them were included in the original complaint, none had been added by a

proper amendment, and none were properly joined because Mr. Grissom did not

show they were related to the incident underlying the claims in his original

complaint. Accordingly, the court dismissed all those claims without prejudice.

This appeal followed.




                                         -8-
II.   DISCUSSION

      We review de novo the district court’s dismissal for failure to state a claim.

Young v. Davis, 554 F.3d 1254, 1256 (10th Cir. 2009). “We review the complaint

for plausibility; that is, to determine whether the complaint includes enough facts

to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Id. (quotation omitted).

      In his appellate brief, Mr. Grissom provides a selective restatement of his

factual allegations, but the full extent of his legal argument is that he thought

what he did “was fair,” and he disagrees with “the way [he] was judged for not

understanding the procedure.” Aplt. Br. at 4. These limited “arguments” are

insufficient to merit appellate review, even taking into account that Mr. Grissom

is not represented by an attorney. See Garrett v. Selby Connor Maddux & Janer,

425 F.3d 836, 840-41 (10th Cir. 2005) (concluding that pro se appellant forfeited

right to appellate review of dismissal of complaint because he did not present any

reasoned arguments supported by record citations or legal authority).

Nonetheless, we have exercised our discretion to review the record and the

applicable law, see id. at 841, and we see no error in the district court’s handling

of this case. The court is commended for its considerable patience in providing

Mr. Grissom a detailed explanation, in plain English, of the deficiencies in his

complaint, and in providing him an opportunity to cure those deficiencies.

      Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court for

substantially the same reasons set out in its screening order and its dismissal

                                          -9-
order. Mr. Grissom’s motion to proceed on appeal without prepayment of fees is

granted, and we remind him that he is obligated to continue making partial

payments until the entire fee has been paid.

BOROUGH OF KENNETT SQUARE
v.
Amrit LAL, Appellant.
Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania.
Submitted on Briefs June 6, 1994.
Decided July 8, 1994.
Reargument Denied August 17, 1994.
*577 Thomas R. Kellogg, for appellant.
John L. Hall, for appellee.
Before COLINS and PELLEGRINI, JJ., and NARICK, Senior Judge.
NARICK, Senior Judge.
Appellant, Amrit Lal, appeals from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County, sitting in equity, ordering injunctive relief and appointing an agent for Appellant to manage Appellant's apartment complex known as "Scarlett Manor Apartments," in order to bring it into compliance with the Borough of Kennett Square's (Borough) housing and building codes.
This matter commenced in February, 1993 when the Borough filed this action in an effort to bring an end to almost five years of continuous litigation with Appellant. From the time Appellant purchased Scarlett Manor Apartments, in March 1988, when they were apparently in a good state of repair and free of any Housing Code (Code) violations, until December 1993, Appellant was cited for more than 160 Code violations, and the Borough had spent more than $40,000.00 in attorney's fees in this effort to compel Appellant's compliance. As noted by the trial court judge, The Honorable Thomas J. Gavin, who had personally heard more than one hundred (100) cases involving Appellant's rental real estate, "[Appellant] is the *578 single most litigious person in the history of Chester County."[1] (T.C. Opinion at 5, December 8, 1993.)
According to the trial court, Appellant's obstructive conduct usually conformed to the following pattern:
Following inspections, the borough would communicate deficiencies to the defendant and suggest that he contact the borough regarding the resolution of same. Several months would pass, often with another intervening inspection, but no corrective action taken. More letters would be generated and ultimately defendant would agree to remedy the deficiencies by a date certain. It is important to note that the defendant was always given leeway to select a date by which the repairs, or deficiencies, would be corrected. The corrective date would come and go with no action by defendant, whereupon the borough would issue citations. Hearings would then be scheduled before the district court (District Court 15-3-04) where the defendant would or would not appear to defend. Whether found guilty by the District Justice or in absentia, an automatic appeal would be taken to the Court of Common Pleas. By the time the cases found their way to my courtroom the deficiencies, which would now be months if not years old, remained uncorrected. In each case numerous pre-trial motions would be filed, often on the day scheduled for trial, asserting that the court lacked jurisdiction, was biased against the defendant, that the borough was discriminating against defendant because of his third world origin, etc. etc. Ultimately the cases would be heard, appropriate verdicts rendered and plaintiff advised that if the repairs were corrected pre-imposition of sentence, nominal fines would be imposed. Invariably, post-verdict motions would be filed, no corrections made and the defendant sentenced accordingly. Thereafter, motions to vacate sentence and/or appeals would be filed with the deficiencies still uncorrected. The deficiencies *579 cited by the borough, by way of example and not limitation, run the gamut from countless vectors (a polite euphemism for cockroaches) scurrying about the apartments to defective and/or leaking and/or missing plumbing fixtures, lighting fixtures that do not work, windows with broken or missing panes, or screens, loose or missing balcony railings, leaking roofs and trash strewn about the properties.
(T.C. Opinion at 2-3, December 8, 1993).
As a result of this delay and vexatious conduct, the Borough filed a complaint asking for the extraordinary remedy of appointment of an agent to manage the apartments and correct the Code violations. In response, Appellant filed preliminary objections which were denied, and Appellant was given leave to file an answer to the Borough's complaint within twenty (20) days. Appellant failed to file an answer within the time allowed, and instead appealed the trial court's denial of his preliminary objections, via a petition for review, to this court. Appellant's petition to vacate Judge Gavin's order denying his preliminary objections was denied by Judge MacElree of the Chester County Court of Common Pleas. Appellant was notified that a default judgment would be taken if he did not file an answer within ten (10) days, and when such answer was not filed, a default judgment was entered and a final hearing to frame an appropriate final decree was scheduled. The final hearing concluded on November 19, 1993, which resulted in the appointment of an agent to manage the apartment buildings in order to correct the problems and bring them into compliance with the Borough's ordinances. Meanwhile, Appellant's legal maneuverings continued with, inter alia, a petition to quash the Borough's request for a final hearing to fashion an appropriate final decree, a petition for recusal of Judge Gavin or transfer to another county, continuing requests for production of documents after a protective order had been granted, and a motion to disqualify the court's appointed agent.
On appeal to this Court, Appellant raises eleven issues for our review, three of which have been waived by failure to *580 raise them in post-trial motions.[2] Pa.R.C.P. No. 227.1(b)(2); Estate of Hall, 517 Pa. 115, 535 A.2d 47 (1987); Borough Council for Borough of Millbourne v. Bargaining Committee of Millbourne Borough Police, 109 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 474, 531 A.2d 565 (1987). We will therefore consider the remaining issues on their merits.
First, Appellant argues that Judge Gavin should have recused because of animosity to Appellant. Judge Gavin denied the motion stating that his actions do not evince any bias towards Appellant. (T.C. Opinion at 2, December 17, 1993.) Like his post-trial motions, Appellant's brief on appeal contains repetitive, generalized, boilerplate allegations of bias and prejudice, but he only indicates one instance which he believes shows the court's animosity, Judge Gavin's threat to hold Appellant in contempt for continuing to cross-examine a witness, Mr. Marguriet, on irrelevant matters. (R. at 50a.) The record indicates that the first questions Appellant asked on cross-examination of Mr. Marguriet, the Manager and Code Enforcement Officer of the Borough, concerned the deeds of properties owned by other landowners, and a case pending against a property owner in the Borough. These questions were clearly irrelevant, and such was Judge Gavin's ruling. Yet, Appellant continued to ask irrelevant questions, until he repeated some he had attempted to ask earlier, and at that point, Judge Gavin warned Appellant to cross-examine only on relevant issues, or risk a contempt citation. (R. 40a-50a.) Judge Gavin remained remarkably patient while Appellant asked one irrelevant question after another, but his repeated rulings were ignored. His warning was therefore warranted, and his threatened use of his contempt powers was entirely proper.
*581 In this jurisdiction, it is presumed that a trial judge is capable of recognizing in himself/herself the symptoms of bias and prejudice. If the judge believes that he or she can hear and dispose of the case without partiality, then that decision will not be overturned, absent an abuse of discretion. Reilly by Reilly v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, 507 Pa. 204, 489 A.2d 1291 (1985); Commonwealth v. Knight, 421 Pa.Superior Ct. 485, 618 A.2d 442 (1992). Here, there was no abuse of discretion in warning Appellant that he would be in contempt of court if he continued to ask totally irrelevant questions. Therefore, there is no merit to Appellant's claim that Judge Gavin should have recused.
Next, Appellant claims that the enforcement of the Borough's ordinances was discriminatory against the low income groups which reside in Scarlett Manor and against Appellant, who claims to be a "member of a minority group, being an Asiatic Indian." Appellant not only failed to prove that there was discriminatory enforcement of the Building Code, but has failed to allege any facts which, if true, would support this claim. Township of Ridley v. Pronesti, 431 Pa. 34, 244 A.2d 719 (1968); Harasty v. Borough of West Brownsville, 50 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 186, 412 A.2d 688 (1980). We will not recapitulate the facts of this case, but suffice to say that the Borough's ordinances were enforced against Appellant because Appellant had violated these ordinances numerous times, there had been numerous complaints by the tenants and others, and because Appellant engaged in every delaying tactic he knew, including abusing his legal rights, to resist abating the conditions for which he was cited and avoid complying with minimal standards of habitability. (Plaintiff's Exhibit 1 and 3.) Therefore, we find no merit to this argument.
Next, Appellant claims that the court erred in entering a final order in this case before the receipt and consideration of post-trial motions. Pa.R.C.P. No. 227.1. Appellant relies on Reading Anthracite Co. v. Rich, 525 Pa. 118, 577 A.2d 881 (1990), where an adjudication and decree nisi were entered which ordered the convening of a meeting within ten (10) days *582 of entry of the final order, and also invited the parties to submit post-verdict motions within ten (10) days. The petitioners filed their motions on the tenth day, but prior to their receipt the chancellor disposed of the ultimate issue in the case. The Supreme Court held that the petitioners were denied due process when they were denied the right to file exceptions or post-trial motions.
This case is readily distinguishable from Reading Anthracite. First, although the December 8, 1993 filing was labeled an opinion and order, Appellant had the opportunity and did file post-trial motions which were thoroughly addressed and considered by the trial court. Moreover, the court was not required to enter a decree nisi because a judgment by default had already been entered. Panther Valley Television Co. v. Borough of Summit Hill, 372 Pa. 524, 94 A.2d 735 (1953). Thus, Reading Anthracite is inapplicable here, and there is no merit to this argument.
Next, Appellant claims that the trial court erred in failing to insure that the party intending to purchase the Scarlett Manor was represented at the hearing, and that the tenants were joined as parties. The issue of the necessity of joining the tenants has been waived because it was not raised at the hearing or in post-trial motions. Moreover, notwithstanding Appellant's allegations regarding a potential buyer for his property, the buyer remains unnamed and unproven in the record. When Appellant's attorney, Mr. Kalmbach, was asked about this buyer, he responded that the Borough was more involved in the negotiations for sale than he was. (R. 84.) However, the attorney for the Borough stated that the Borough knew very little about the potential sale, apart from what was told them by Appellant months before. The Borough never saw a copy of the alleged agreement of sale and never knew the name of the alleged, potential buyers. (R. 83-85.) Appellant did not offer any more specific information about the buyers during the hearing, although he was given every opportunity to do so. Instead, he continued to rely on his and his attorney's assertions that the sale was imminent. *583 (R. 85.) The court cannot join a person or persons in a proceeding when it has not been given information as to the identity of such persons, and when it has received no evidence confirming an interest in the property which would be affected by the court's proceedings. Therefore, there is no merit to Appellant's allegation of trial court error on this issue.
Next, Appellant claims that the relief ordered was not a proper exercise of the equitable powers of the court because he made substantial efforts to provide decent housing for the tenants and to comply with the general intent of the ordinance. Appellant cites his own testimony and that of his manager, Mr. Ayra, both of whom the court specifically found not credible. As an example of Mr. Ayra's testimony, he made the incredible statement that perhaps he failed to notice certain Code violations because he made inspections only in the evening. (R. 167a). Although he claimed to have called repair persons to correct the problems, he did not produce a single receipt or cancelled check to prove that they had undertaken the repairs they claimed to have accomplished. As factfinder in the evidentiary hearing, the trial court was free to disregard Appellant's testimony and make findings as to credibility. Commonwealth v. Nunez, 312 Pa.Superior. Ct. 584, 459 A.2d 376 (1983). In no uncertain terms, the trial court found Appellant incredible and disregarded the testimony he and Mr. Ayra offered.
Next, Appellant claims that the trial court had an adequate remedy at law, and therefore equitable relief should not have been granted. Citing School District of West Homestead v. Allegheny County Board of School Directors, 440 Pa. 113, 269 A.2d 904 (1970), Appellant argues that the trial court had no jurisdiction to consider this action in equity because: (1) there is a constitutionally valid statute, the Borough's citation procedures, which provide an explicit and exclusive administrative remedial process, with review by the Court of Common Pleas; and (2) the statutory remedy is adequate and compliance with the statutory remedy will not cause irremedial harm.
*584 The Borough Code provides that boroughs are specifically vested with the power to enforce housing ordinances by instituting appropriate actions or proceedings in law or in equity. The Borough Code, Act of February 1, 1966, P.L. (1965) 1656, as amended, 53 P.S. § 46202(24). Although there are explicit legal and administrative procedures for serving citations for violations of the Borough's housing ordinances, under the Borough Code, they are not the exclusive remedies available to the authorities, and the courts may proceed in equity.
The trial court held that the inadequacy of the available legal remedies was proven by evidence that Code violations continue unabated, notwithstanding the filing of multiple actions by the Borough against Appellant. (T.C. Opinion at 10, December 8, 1993). In explaining this holding the trial court stated, "The borough has tried amicably and legally for five years to compel defendant to meet those minimum standards its other citizens are required to adhere to . . . If equitable relief is not granted, the borough will continue to be frustrated in its legitimate efforts to enforce its housing codes." (T.C. Opinion at 8-9, December 8, 1993).
Equity has jurisdiction notwithstanding a failure to pursue an available statutory remedy if that remedy is inadequate. While this Court is reluctant to favor equity over administrative remedies, it is appropriate to take equity jurisdiction to avoid a multiplicity of actions. Temple University v. Department of Public Welfare, 30 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 595, 374 A.2d 991 (1977). We hold that the remedies at law, the hundreds of citations for violations of the housing code received by Appellant, have been inadequate to insure their enforcement. Thus, the safety and the habitability of the premises can not be guaranteed, and the health and welfare of the tenants residing in Appellant's apartment complex is endangered. Therefore, it was perfectly appropriate for the court to provide equitable relief in the form of appointment of an agent to manage the Scarlett Manor apartments.
*585 Appellant next claims that the court erred in failing to open the default judgment. The decision to open a default judgment is left to the sound discretion of the trial court, which must determine that: (1) the petition to open was promptly filed; (2) there was a reasonable excuse for failure to respond; and (3) a meritorious defense must be shown. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority v. DiAntonio, 152 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 237, 618 A.2d 1182 (1992). Appellant cannot meet any part of this test.
First, judgment by default for failure to answer the Borough's complaint was entered on September 10, 1993. Appellant did not file his petition to open until December 13, 1993. Although he states he relied on his petition for review of the trial court's dismissal of his preliminary objections, which were filed in this court, to stay the proceedings on the default judgment so that he did not need to file an answer, such reliance was misplaced. Pa.R.A.P. 1701(b)(6) provides that the trial court may proceed further in any matter in which a nonappealable interlocutory order has been entered, notwithstanding the filing of a notice of appeal or a petition for review. Here, Appellant attempted to appeal a nonappealable interlocutory order, which this court dismissed on two different occasions, September 15, 1993 and October 29, 1993, and therefore the trial court properly continued to proceed in this matter while the appeals were pending. Even if we were to accept that Appellant were relying on his petitions for review to stay the proceeding, he still waited for over a month to file his petition to open after his petitions to this Court were dismissed. Thus, the petition to open was not promptly filed, and there is no reasonable excuse for Appellant's failure to respond to the trial court's order to file an answer to the Borough's complaint.
Moreover, as we have discussed, no meritorious defense, which has been defined as a defense sufficient to justify relief if proven, Id., was offered. As discussed above, all Appellant's defenses are without merit and are therefore insufficient to justify relief. Therefore, the trial court did not err in refusing to open the default judgement.
*586 Finally, Appellant claims that the decree should be vacated because the court did not require that the agent appointed by the court to manage Appellant's property post bond pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 1533(d). Rule 1533(d) provides that a "receiver" must give security for the faithful performance of his duty as the court shall direct, and shall not act until the security is paid.
Here, however, an "agent" was appointed, similar to the agent required by the Borough Code, Section 8-107, which requires an owner of any apartment building to register a person to serve as a responsible local agent. Traditionally a person seeking a receiver does so to protect property in which he or she has an interest. Levin v. Barish, 505 Pa. 514, 481 A.2d 1183 (1984); Northampton National Bank of Easton v. Piscanio, 475 Pa. 57, 379 A.2d 870 (1977).[3] Here, the agent was not appointed to protect the assets of a party which has a property interest in Appellant's property; he was only appointed to manage the property in compliance with local ordinances, as would a responsible local agent. Moreover, the appointment does not divest Appellant of his interest in the property; he retains the power to repair and maintain his property if he so chooses. Therefore, we find no merit to Appellant's claim that the trial court erred in failing to require the agent to post security.
We believe that the repetitious and frivolous nature of this appeal entitles the Borough to the award of reasonable counsel fees pursuant to Section 2503(7) of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. § 2503(7) and Pa.R.A.P. 2744(1). Gossman v. Lower Chanceford Township Board of Supervisors, 503 Pa. 392, 469 A.2d 996 (1983). Moreover, in In the Matter of Appeal of Richard Michael George, 101 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 241, 515 A.2d 1047 (1986), and Patel v. Workmen's Compensation *587 Appeal Board (Sauquoit Fibers Co.), 103 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 290, 520 A.2d 525, appeal denied, 515 Pa. 616, 530 A.2d 869 (1987), we held that we are clearly authorized, under Pa.R.A.P. 2744, to sua sponte impose on the appellant the sanction of paying the reasonable counsel fees of the appellee, and while we did not at that time award fees, we held that such abuse of this Court's appeals process may in the future result in the imposition of such sanctions.
Here, Appellant has so clearly abused the legal process that we now impose on Appellant, sua sponte, the sanction of paying reasonable counsel fees. This appeal was a result of Appellant's refusal to respond to the Borough's complaint in equity, and instead twice appealing the trial court's preliminary rulings. Then, when Appellant suffered a judgement by default, brought on by his own intentional conduct, he filed this appeal, raising numerous, frivolous issues designed to obstruct and delay the equitable relief ordered by the trial court.
Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's order in its entirety, and remand to the trial court for the calculation of reasonable fees incurred by the Borough in this appeal, to be paid by Appellant.

ORDER
AND NOW, this 8th day of July, 1994, the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County in the above-captioned matter is affirmed. Further, the case is remanded to the trial court for calculation of reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the Borough in this appeal, to be paid by Appellant.
Jurisdiction relinquished.
NOTES
[1]  The trial court noted that Appellant has a Ph.D. and a law degree, and the level of sophistication of his pleadings and his ability to manipulate the rules shows he was not a typical pro se litigator. Rather, he was more an unlicensed lawyer of considerable skill. (T.C. Opinion at 6, December 8, 1993.)
[2]  Although Appellant raised more than fifty (50) issues in the trial court he still has waived the following issues: (1) The Building Code of the Borough of Kennett Square was unconstitutional as it bears no reasonable relationship to the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the community; (2) There is no basis for equity jurisdiction because by its inaction the Borough brought about the conditions of which it complains; (3) The Court was in error to exclude certain evidence.
[3]  It was held in DeAngelis v. Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Co., 467 Pa. 410, 358 A.2d 53 (1976), that it was improper to appoint a receiver when the party petitioning for such an appointment does not have a lien on the property in question, and only has contract rights to the property which have not been reduced to judgment. Thus, the petitioning party did not have sufficient property rights in the disputed property to force the appointment of a receiver.

MEMORANDUM & ORDER
LUNGSTRUM, District Judge.
Plaintiffs filed suit against defendants asserting various claims arising out of defendants' acquisition of plaintiff Horizon Marine LC, an aluminum boat manufacturing company. Specifically, plaintiffs Horizon Holdings, LLC f/k/a Horizon Marine LC (hereinafter "Horizon") and Geoffrey Pepper claimed that defendants breached both the express terms of the purchase agreement entered into between the parties and the duty of good faith and fair dealing implied in the purchase agreement. Plaintiffs Horizon and Mr. Pepper further claimed that defendants made a variety of fraudulent misrepresentations to them for the purpose of inducing plaintiffs to enter into the purchase agreement. In addition, plaintiffs Cassandra O'Tool and John O'Tool alleged that defendants breached the employment agreements signed by them. Ms. O'Tool further alleged that defendants discriminated against her on the basis of her pregnancy when they denied her a raise and when they terminated her employment. Finally, Ms. O'Tool and Mr. Pepper claimed that defendants unlawfully terminated their employment in retaliation for Ms. O'Tool's and Mr. Pepper's complaints of pregnancy discrimination. For a more thorough understanding of the facts of this case, please see the court's order resolving defendants' motions for summary judgment, Horizon Holdings, L.L.C. v. Genmar Holdings, Inc., 241 F.Supp.2d 1123 (D.Kan.2002).
In November 2002, plaintiffs' claims were tried to a jury and, at the conclusion of the trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiffs Horizon and Mr. Pepper on their breach of contract claim in the amount of $2,500,000. The jury also found in favor of the O'Tools on their claims that defendants breached the O'Tools' employment contracts and awarded Ms. O'Tool the sum of $63,200 and Mr. O'Tool the sum of $20,313. The jury found in favor of defendants on all other claims.
This matter is presently before the court on three post-trial motions-plaintiffs' motion to alter or amend the judgment (doc. # 197); plaintiffs' motion for attorneys' fees, costs and expenses (doc. # 198); and defendants' renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50(b) or, in the alternative, motion for remittitur *1256 and/or new trial pursuant to Rule 59 (doc. # 199). As set forth in more detail below, plaintiffs' motion to alter or amend the judgment is granted only to the extent that a typographical error in the judgment will be corrected and is otherwise denied; plaintiffs' motion for attorneys' fees, costs and expenses is granted in part and denied in part; and defendants' renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law, for remittitur and/or for a new trial is denied.

I. Defendants' Renewed Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law, for Remittitur and/or for New Trial
Defendants seek post-trial relief on all aspects of the jury's verdict that are favorable to plaintiffs. The primary thrust of defendants' post-trial motion concerns the jury's verdict of $2.5 million in favor of Horizon and Mr. Pepper on the breach of contract claim. According to defendants, this award constitutes a windfall unsupported by the facts or the law. Defendants urge that plaintiffs, as a matter of law, are not entitled to recover any damages in the form of lost earn-out. In the alternative, defendants contend that the award must be remitted or a new trial must be granted on lost earn-out damages. Defendants also seek judgment as a matter of law on the jury's liability finding on the breach of contract claim, asserting that plaintiffs failed to present legally sufficient evidence that defendants breached the express or implied terms of the purchase agreement. Similarly, defendants move for judgment as a matter of law on the O'Tools' claims for breach of their respective employment agreements or for a remittitur of those verdicts. Finally, defendants assert that they are entitled to a new trial because the court erroneously admitted parol evidence and erroneously instructed the jury on the duty of good faith and fair dealing.

A. The Jury's Verdict in favor of Plaintiffs Horizon and Geoff Pepper on their Breach of Contract Claim
The court first addresses defendants' argument that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the jury's liability finding with respect to Horizon and Mr. Pepper's breach of contract claim. Judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) "should be cautiously and sparingly granted," Black v. M & W Gear Co., 269 F.3d 1220, 1238 (10th Cir.2001), and is appropriate only if the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, "points but one way and is susceptible to no reasonable inferences supporting the party opposing the motion." Sanjuan v. IBP, Inc., 275 F.3d 1290, 1293 (10th Cir.2002). In determining whether judgment as a matter of law is proper, the court may not weigh the evidence, consider the credibility of witnesses, or substitute its judgment for that of the jury. See Turnbull v. Topeka State Hosp., 255 F.3d 1238, 1241 (10th Cir.2001).
In essence, the court must affirm the jury verdict if, viewing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, it contains evidence upon which the jury could properly return a verdict for the nonmoving party. See Roberts v. Progressive Independence, Inc., 183 F.3d 1215, 1219-20 (10th Cir.1999) (citing Harolds Stores, Inc. v. Dillard Dep't Stores, Inc., 82 F.3d 1533, 1546 (10th Cir.1996)). Conversely, the court must enter judgment as a matter of law in favor of the moving party if "there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis ... with respect to a claim or defense ... under the controlling law." Deters v. Equifax Credit Information Servs., Inc., 202 F.3d 1262, 1268 (10th Cir. 2000) (quoting Harolds, 82 F.3d at 1546-47).
In their papers, defendants assert that, as a matter of law, they did not breach the express terms of the purchase *1257 agreement or the implied terms of the purchase agreement. The jury was instructed that they could find in favor of plaintiffs on plaintiffs' breach of contract claim if they found that plaintiffs had proved a breach of one or more express terms or a breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. See Jury Instruction 12. Because the court concludes that there was ample evidence presented at trial to support a finding that defendants breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the court declines to address defendants' arguments concerning whether the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that defendants had breached any express terms of the purchase agreement.
According to defendants, plaintiffs' claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing fails as a matter of law because it purports to "add wholly new terms to the contract" and "requires the court to rewrite or supply omitted provisions to the purchase agreement in contravention of Delaware law." [1] This is, of course, an accurate statement of Delaware law. See, e.g., Cincinnati SMS A Limited Partnership v. Cincinnati Bell Cellular Systems Co., 708 A.2d 989, 992 (Del. 1998) ("Delaware observes the wellestablished general principle that ... it is not the proper role of a court to rewrite or supply omitted provisions to a written agreement."). Nonetheless, principles of good faith and fair dealing permit a court to imply certain terms in an agreement so as to honor the parties' reasonable expectations when those obligations were omitted, in the literal sense, from the text of the written agreement but can be understood from the text of the agreement. Id. In determining whether to imply terms in an agreement, the proper focus is on "what the parties likely would have done if they had considered the issue involved." Id.
Nothing in this court's instructions to the jury would have permitted the jury to "rewrite" the purchase agreement or to inject into that agreement wholly new terms. In fact, the jury was instructed, entirely consistent with Delaware law, that they should consider "whether it is clear from what was expressly agreed upon by the parties that the parties would have agreed to prohibit the conduct complained of as a breach of the agreement had they thought to negotiate with respect to that matter." See Jury Instruction 12. Defendants argue in their papers that Mr. Pepper did not demonstrate at trial that the parties would have agreed to prohibit the challenged conduct if they had thought to negotiate about such conduct. Of course, defendants also made this argument to the jury. The jury rejected the argument and there was more than sufficient evidence presented at trial to support that conclusion.
For example, the jury could have readily concluded that, in light of the express agreement that plaintiffs would have an opportunity to realize up to $5.2 million in earn-out consideration (defined in the agreement itself as part of the "purchase price"), that the parties would have agreed, had they thought about it, that defendants would not be permitted to undermine Mr. Pepper's authority as president of Genmar Kansas; to abandon the Horizon brand name entirely; to mandate production of Ranger and Crestliner brands at the Genmar Kansas facility to the detriment of the Horizon brand; or to reimburse Genmar Kansas at only "standard cost"[2] for the manufacture of Ranger *1258 and Crestliner boats thereby impairing realization of the earn-out. If the jury concluded that defendants had engaged in such conduct (and there was sufficient evidence to draw such a conclusion), then the jury was free to conclude that such conduct was inconsistent with the spirit of the agreement concerning the earn-out consideration and that such conduct constituted a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In short, there is evidence in the record upon which a jury could properly return a verdict for Horizon and Mr. Pepper on their breach of contract claim. Judgment as a matter of law, then, is not appropriate.
Defendants also assert that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Horizon and Mr. Pepper's breach of contract claim because plaintiffs failed to present evidence upon which a reasonable jury could have concluded that defendants acted in bad faith. In support of this argument, defendants point to a Delaware Supreme Court decision defining "bad faith" as "the conscious doing of a wrong because of a dishonest purpose or moral obliquity; it is different from the negative idea of negligent in that it contemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or ill will." See Desert Equities, Inc. v. Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund. II, L.P., 624 A.2d 1199, 1209 n. 16 (Del. 1993). According to defendants, the evidence concerning defendants' course of conduct demonstrates only that defendants were attempting to make a profit and that no evidence was presented that defendants were acting with any furtive design or ill will.
As an initial matter, the jury was instructed that a "violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing implicitly indicates bad faith conduct." See Jury Instruction 12. Thus, the court's instruction certainly requires that defendants' conduct reflect some element of bad faith. While the jury was not required to find specifically that defendants acted with furtive design or ill will in order to find that defendants had breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, defendants have not directed the court to any cases suggesting that proof of a breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing is inadequate in the absence of proof of some furtive design or ill will. Certainly, the Desert Equities case does not suggest such a conclusion. There, the court defined "bad faith" only for purposes of contrasting the nature of that claim with a fraud claim in explaining why it was rejecting the defendants' argument that a plaintiff must plead with particularity under Rule 9(b) a claim of bad faith. See 624 A.2d at 1208. The court, then, rejects defendants' suggestion that evidence of some furtive design or ill will was necessary for a finding of liability on plaintiffs' claim that defendants breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. See True North Composites, LLC v. Trinity Indus., Inc., 191 F.Supp.2d 484, 517-18 (D.Del.2002) (rejecting argument that claimant must prove that the other party acted "with furtive design or ill will" in order to prove a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing).
In any event, even assuming that plaintiffs were required to prove that defendants acted with furtive design or ill will *1259 in order to prove a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, copious evidence was presented at trial demonstrating that defendants acted with the requisite "dishonest purpose" or "furtive design." There was ample evidence, for example, that defendants had ulterior motives for acquiring Horizon Marine, including the desire to remove a potentially significant competitor from the market and the desire to obtain a facility in the "southern" market dedicated primarily to the production of Ranger boats. There was also substantial evidence demonstrating that defendants' course of conduct was intended to benefit defendants' bottom line to the financial detriment of Mr. Pepper.
In that regard, the jury could reasonably have concluded that defendants' efforts to undermine Mr. Pepper's authority as president of Genmar Kansas and their decisions to abandon the Horizon brand name entirely, to mandate the production of Ranger and Crestliner brands at the Genmar Kansas facility and to reimburse Genmar Kansas at only "standard cost" for the manufacture of Ranger and Crestliner boats were all designed to either force Mr. Pepper to quit his employment (thereby extinguishing Mr. Pepper's right to collect any earn-out) or prevent Mr. Pepper from achieving the profit margins necessary to realize his earn-out (because the formula pursuant to which the earn-out was calculated was weighted heavily in favor of the production of Horizon boats). While defendants urge that such a characterization of the evidence simply makes no sense because defendants themselves made no money on the Horizon Marine acquisition (an argument that defendants presented at length to the jury), the evidence was sufficient to support the conclusion that defendants believed (but were ultimately incorrect) that they could still turn a profit through the production of Ranger and Crestliner boats at Genmar Kansas while simultaneously preventing Mr. Pepper from realizing any earn-out by stifling the production of Horizon boats and reimbursing Genmar Kansas only at standard cost for the production of other boats. Simply put, ample evidence was presented from which the jury could reasonably conclude that defendants' conduct, taken as a whole, was in "bad faith," regardless of how that phrase is defined.
In sum, the evidence presented at trial was more than adequate for the jury to conclude that defendants breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Defendants' motion on this issue is denied.

B. The Jury's Award of $2.5 Million for Lost Earn-Out Consideration
Defendants contend that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Horizon and Mr. Pepper's claim for damages for two separate but related reasons. First, defendants assert that plaintiffs presented no evidence whatsoever for the jury to ascertain what position plaintiffs would have been in if the purchase agreement had been properly performed. Second, defendants assert that Delaware law precludes any recovery because Genmar Kansas was a new business with no profit history and no evidence was presented from which the jury could conclude that Genmar Kansas was reasonably certain to realize the gross profit margins necessary to achieve any earn-out under the agreement. In the alternative, defendants seek an order remitting the award to nominal damages of one dollar or a new trial on the issue of damages.

1. Judgment as a Matter of Law
The jury was instructed that if they found that defendants had breached the purchase agreement and that plaintiffs sustained damages as a result of that *1260 breach, then Horizon and Mr. Pepper were entitled to compensation "in an amount that [would] place them in the same position they would have been in if the purchase agreement had been properly performed." See Jury Instruction 13. According to defendants, plaintiffs made no effort to explain to the jury how, assuming defendants had performed their contractual obligations in good faith, Genmar Kansas would have ever met the requisite gross profit margins or generated the gross revenues necessary to entitle them to substantial earn-out payments. Stated another way, defendants urge that there was simply no evidence presented at trial that Genmar Kansas would have been profitable absent defendants' breach of the purchase agreement.
The evidence presented at trial, however, was more than sufficient to permit the jury to conclude that Genmar Kansas would have been profitable absent defendants' breach. Mr. Pepper, for example, testified on the second day of his direct examination that, in his mind, the requisite 13 percent gross profit margin was reasonable and obtainable based on his prior experience with other industry boat companies. According to Mr. Pepper, he had worked for other companies where the gross profit margins ranged from 15 percent to 30 percent, so the 13 percent figure seemed "low" to him. Mr. Pepper further testified that during the time that he was responsible for directing Lowe's manufacturing operations,[3] Lowe achieved gross profit percentages in the range of 30 percent. Mr. Pepper cautioned, however, that he needed a certain level of autonomy with respect to the management of Genmar Kansas to ensure that Genmar Kansas would realize the profits and revenues necessary for Mr. Pepper to obtain the earnout. Specifically, Mr. Pepper testified on the first day of his direct examination that he sought (and received) assurances from Mr. Oppegaard and Mr. Cloutier that they would "allow [him] to do what is necessary in managing the company to obtain that earn-out." According to Mr. Pepper, Mr. Oppegaard further assured him that he would be in control of Genmar Kansas' operations and that he would be able to make the "operation decisions necessary" to obtain the earn-out.
The evidence presented at trial was also sufficient from which the jury could conclude that Horizon Marine, just prior to defendants' acquisition, was about to "break into the black" and turn a profit. Mr. Pepper, for example, testified on the first day of his direct examination that Horizon Marine was enjoying significant progress in late 1997 and the first six months of 1998. Mr. Pepper fully expected Horizon Marine to start making a profit in 1998. Indeed, the opinions and perspectives of other people associated with the acquisition lent additional credence to Mr. Pepper's beliefs. Mr. Pepper testified on direct examination, for example, that Bill Ek, a consultant for defendants who visited the Horizon Marine facility in November 1997, was "amazed" at "how far [Horizon Marine] had come in such a short period of time." Mr. Oppegaard testified on cross-examination that Mr. Ek had advised him that Mr. Pepper was "the best product development person in the industry." Similarly, the jury heard testimony on the first day of Mr. Pepper's direct examination that Mr. Oppegaard was impressed and excited about what Mr. Pepper had been able to accomplish with Horizon Marine in a short period of time. In fact, Mr. Oppegaard, after meeting Mr. Pepper and visiting Horizon Marine for the first time, sent an internal memorandum *1261 to his executive team in which he described Mr. Pepper and the Horizon product as "a major competitor if left alone to grow." Mr. Oppegaard also testified on cross-examination that he anticipated that Horizon Marine would grow very fast.
From this evidence, a reasonable jury could infer that if defendants had allowed Mr. Pepper to direct the daily operations of Genmar Kansas, then Mr. Pepper would have been able to achieve the requisite gross profit margins to realize the earnout. See Harrington v. Hollingsworth, 1992 WL 91165, at *4 (Del.Super.Ct. Apr. 15, 1992) (in breach of contract case, lost income damages not speculative where commercial fisherman testified that had the defendant constructed his larger commercial fishing boat on time, he would have been able to catch more sea bass and double his annual income; fisherman's testimony was sufficient to establish damages with reasonable probability where his projections were based on bass fishing industry, an industry with which plaintiff was familiar and in which he had participated for 20 years).
Moreover, defendants attempted to demonstrate at trial-through both argument and the examination of witnessesthat plaintiffs' claim for damages based on the earn-out was unreasonable because it was uncertain whether the company would have been able to meet the requisite profit margins and revenues. Defendants' efforts in that regard apparently had some impact-the jury awarded only half of the total earn-out consideration. Presumably, then, the jury concluded that plaintiffs had not proved loss of the total earn-out amount with reasonable certainty. Finally, any doubt concerning the amount of damages sustained by plaintiffs is resolved against defendants. As the breaching party, defendants "should not be permitted to reap advantage from [their] own wrong by insisting on proof which by reason of [their] breach is unobtainable." See E. Allan Farnsworth, Contracts § 12.15 at 922 (2d ed.1990); accord Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 352 cmt. a (Any doubts in the proof of damages are resolved against the party in breach because "[a] party who has, by his breach, forced the injured party to seek compensation in damages should not be allowed to profit from his breach where it is established that a significant loss has occurred.").
In a related argument, defendants contend that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on plaintiffs' claim for damages because, under Delaware law, "a new business with no profit history cannot obtain lost profit damages." See Defs. Br. at 7. On its face, then, defendants' argument is premised on the idea that plaintiffs' damages for lost earn-out consideration is the equivalent of an award for damages based on lost profits. Given the nature of the earn-out consideration at issue in this case, however, it is simply not appropriate to subject plaintiffs' claim for damages to a traditional lost profits analysis.
To be sure, Genmar Kansas' profitability was an important component of the earnout formula. However, unlike those cases in which one party seeks to recover lost profits when the issue of whether that party could reasonably expect such profits is in dispute, the parties here agreed at the outset of their relationship that it was reasonable for Mr. Pepper to expect an additional $5.2 million in earn-out consideration pursuant to a formula developed by defendants. Indeed, the parties agreed that the earn-out consideration was part of the total purchase price for the acquisitionan agreement that is reflected in Article 2 of the contract, which states that the "Cash Consideration and the Earn-Out Consideration described in Section 2.2 below are referred to in this Agreement in *1262 the aggregate as the `Purchase Price.'" See Trial Ex. 227a § 2.1. As Mr. Pepper explained on the second day of his direct examination, defendants initially proposed the earn-out consideration as "more of an incentive-type thing" separate and apart from the purchase price. However, after multiple discussions during which Mr. Pepper, Mr. Oppegaard and Mr. Cloutier all agreed that the earn-out was obtainable and that Mr. Pepper would be given the requisite autonomy to obtain the earn-out, defendants ultimately agreed to include the earn-out as part of the purchase price.
While both parties agreed at trial that the earn-out was not a "guarantee," ample evidence was presented that all parties believed there to be "reasonable probability" that Mr. Pepper would realize the full amount of the earn-out. Indeed, on his direct examination, Mr. Pepper testified that both Mr. Cloutier and Mr. Oppegaard assured him that the earn-out was obtainable. On his cross-examination, Mr. Pepper testified that he advised his investors in writing that "the management of Horizon believes there is a reasonable probability that ... the earn-out consideration will be achieved." Similarly, Mr. Cloutier testified on direct examination that he he believed at the time of the transaction that Mr. Pepper had a "very realistic" opportunity to achieve the earn-out. Moreover, on cross-examination, Mr. Cloutier testified that he believed that the earn-out portion of the purchase agreement was achievable based in part on defendants' own internal projections.
In their papers, defendants now characterize their assurances and beliefs that the earn-out was obtainable as mere "pre-contractual guesswork" and contend that to permit plaintiffs to recover damages based on such guesswork without considering Genmar Kansas' "actual performance" is to provide plaintiffs with an "unwarranted windfall." This argument, however, ignores the significance of the jury's implicit finding-that Genmar Kansas' actual performance would have been different (indeed, it would have been profitable) had defendants performed their obligations under the purchase agreement consistent with plaintiffs' reasonable expectations. In other words, the jury apparently found that defendants' conduct, including undermining Mr. Pepper's managerial authority and requiring increased production of multiple models of Ranger boats, had the effect of rendering Mr. Pepper unable to perform as he had planned, unable to operate Genmar Kansas appropriately and ultimately unable to succeed in achieving any earnout consideration. For these reasons, defendants' reliance on the actual performance of Genmar Kansas as a basis for judgment as a matter of law is misplaced.
In sum, the court rejects defendants' attempt to analyze plaintiffs' claim for damages as one for lost profits. The jury's award of $2.5 million is not speculative and is supported by evidence that Genmar Kansas would have been profitable and that the earn-out would have been obtainable if defendants had performed in good faith their obligations under the purchase agreement.

2. Remittitur
As an alternative to their argument that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on plaintiffs' claim for damages in the form of lost earn-out, defendants maintain that this court should enter a remittitur reducing the $2.5 million verdict to nominal damages of one dollar in light of the "utterly speculative nature" of the lost earn-out damages. Of course, the court has already concluded that the jury's award of $2.5 million was not speculative, so the motion for remittitur is denied. In any event, under Delaware law, the court may order a remittitur only if the verdict *1263 "is so grossly out of proportion as to shock the Court's conscience." See Gillenardo v. Connor Broadcasting Delaware Co., 2002 WL 991110 at *10 (Del.Super.Ct. Apr.30, 2002) (citing Mills v. Telenczak, 345 A.2d 424, 426 (Del.1975)); see also Century 21 Real Estate Corp. v. Meraj Int'l Investment Corp., 315 F.3d 1271, 1281 (10th Cir.2003) (in assessing measure of damages awarded pursuant to contract containing choice of law provision, district court must follow chosen state's law-absent any argument that choice of law provision is unenforceable-including that state's law concerning remittitur).
Again, the jury had before it sufficient evidence to conclude that plaintiffs would have realized a significant portion of the earn-out consideration had defendants performed in good faith their obligations under the contract. The $2.5 million verdict represents exactly half of the entire earnout portion of the purchase agreement and exactly half of what the plaintiffs sought to recover on their breach of contract claim. The award is not excessive, it is not unreasonable, it does not shock the court's conscience and, thus, it will not be remitted. See id. at 1282-83 (affirming district court's refusal to remit $700,000 verdict on breach of contract claim, despite concerns about reliability of testimony concerning lost profits and "unrealistic" projections; district court reviewed award under "shock the conscience" standard).

3. New Trial
Defendants' final arguments with respect to the jury's verdict on plaintiffs' breach of contract claim is that they are entitled to a new trial because the verdict is against the weight of the evidence and the result of passion and prejudice. Delaware law permits a district court to set aside a verdict and order a new trial only if "the evidence preponderates so heavily against the jury verdict that a reasonable jury could not have reached the result." See Gannett Co. v. Re, 496 A.2d 553, 558 (Del. 1985). For the reasons set forth above in connection with defendants' motion for judgment as a matter of law, the court concludes that evidence presented at trial was sufficient for the jury to have reached the result that it did. Similarly, for the reasons explained above, the court cannot conclude that the verdict is so clearly excessive as to indicate that it was the result of passion or prejudice. See Yankanwich v. Wharton, 460 A.2d 1326, 1332 (Del.1983) ("A verdict will not be disturbed as excessive unless it is so clearly so as to indicate that it was the result of passion, prejudice, partiality, or corruption; or that it was manifestly the result of disregard of the evidence or applicable rules of law."). The jury's verdict of $2.5 million on plaintiffs' breach of contract claim will stand.

C. The Jury's Verdicts in favor of Cassandra O'Tool and John O'Tool
The jury also found in favor of Cassandra O'Tool and John O'Tool on their claims that defendants breached the O'Tools' employment contracts. The jury awarded Ms. O'Tool the sum of $63,200 and Mr. O'Tool the sum of $20,313. Defendants assert that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the O'Tools' claims for breach of their employment contracts or, in the alternative, that they are entitled to a remittitur reducing the damages awarded to the O'Tools. For the reasons explained below, defendants' motion is denied.

1. Judgment as a Matter of Law
At trial, Cassandra and John O'Tool argued that defendants breached the express terms of their respective employment agreements. Specifically, the O'Tools maintained that, pursuant to the express language of their employment agreements, defendants could not discharge Mr. or Ms. O'Tool prior to the end *1264 of an initial three-year employment period except in four narrow circumstances and that they were not discharged for any of those four reasons. In support of their argument, the O'Tools highlighted for the jury section 3 and section 7 of their employment agreements:
3. Term of Employment. This Agreement shall have a term of three (3) years, subject to earlier termination pursuant to the provisions of Section 7 hereof.
* * * * * *
7. Termination and Severance.

(a) This Agreement may be terminated prior to the end of the three (3) year term by Genmar Kansas for (i) cause, (ii) lack of adequate job performance as determined by Genmar Kansas' President and the President of Genmar Holdings, (iii) death of Employee, or (iv) disability of Employee.
(b) In the event Genmar Kansas terminates Employees employment for any reason other than termination for cause, death or disability Employee shall be entitled to six (6) months of severance pay at the base salary Employee is earning on the date of such termination.
Defendants attempted to convince the jury, and now the court, that the O'Tools were terminated for "lack of adequate job performance" consistent with section 7 of their employment contracts. The jury clearly rejected defendants' argument and, in finding that defendants breached the O'Tools' employment contracts, concluded that the O'Tools were not terminated for inadequate job performance or any other reason set forth in section 7. Indeed, ample evidence was presented at trial to support the jury's conclusion. In that regard, the jury could have concluded (and presumably did conclude) that the O'Tools were terminated not because of any performance issues but because of their familial ties with Geoff Pepper, the key individual with whom defendants were attempting to sever their relationship. In other words, the jury could have easily concluded from the evidence presented at trial that defendants terminated Mr. and Mrs. O'Tool because defendants believed it would be awkward to retain the O'Tools after terminating Geoff Pepper.
Another possibility, equally supported by the evidence, is that the jury concluded that the O'Tools were terminated for inadequate job performance but that the assessment of their job performance was not, as required by section 7, "determined by Genmar Kansas' President and the President of Genmar Holdings." Specifically, the jury could have concluded that Mr. Pepper was still serving as the president of Genmar Kansas during the relevant time period and that Mr. Pepper had not determined that his daughter and son-inlaw were performing inadequately. Moreover, the jury could have concluded from the evidence presented at trial that Mr. Oppegaard, the president of Genmar Holdings, had simply not made an assessment of the O'Tools' job performance. In fact, Mr. Oppegaard testified at trial that he had never discussed with Mr. Pepper the adequacy of the O'Tools' job performance and that he did not make the decision to terminate the O'Tools.
Defendants also reiterate their argument (made at the summary judgment stage, to the court at the close of plaintiffs' case and to the jury throughout the trial) that Section 12 of the O'Tools' employment agreements eviscerates any notion that the O'Tools were guaranteed employment for a three-year term.[4] Section 12 of the *1265 agreement, entitled "Miscellaneous," contains the following sentence: "This Agreement shall not give Employee any right to be employed for any specific time or otherwise limit Genmar Kansas' right to terminate Employees employment at any time with or without cause." As the court noted in its summary judgment order, however, any ambiguity created when sections 3 and 7 are read together with section 12 was for the jury to resolve and defendants certainly are not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the O'Tools' breach of contract claims based on the language of section 12. See Horizon Holdings, L.L.C. v. Genmar Holdings, Inc., 241 F.Supp.2d 1123, 1146 (D.Kan.2002). Moreover, the jury could have concluded that section 12, read literally, gives only Genmar Kansas the right to terminate an employee for any reason whatsoever and that, in contrast, Genmar Holdings and Genmar Industries are bound by the language of sections 3 and 7.
In sum, the court certainly cannot conclude as a matter of law that the O'Tools were terminated for lack of adequate job performance consistent with section 7 of their employment agreements or that the O'Tools were not guaranteed any specific term of employment. The record contains more than sufficient evidence upon which the jury could properly return a verdict for the O'Tools on their breach of contract claims.

2. Remittitur
In the alternative, defendants urge that the damages awarded by the jury to the O'Tools are excessive and against the weight of the evidence and, as a result, they ask the court to enter an order of remittitur reducing the awards. The court begins with defendants' arguments concerning the jury's award of $63,200 to Ms. O'Tool. According to defendants, Ms. O'Tool's lost wages for the relevant time period were only $52,000 and thus, the jury must have awarded Ms. O'Tool more than $11,000 in lost MIP earnings (a bonus pursuant to defendants' Management Incentive Program). Defendants urge that the $52,000 in lost wages must be reduced because the jury failed to deduct from this amount any wages that Ms. O'Tool could have earned if she had made reasonable efforts to obtain other employment.
Of course, the burden was on defendants to prove that Ms. O'Tool failed to mitigate her damages. See Leavenworth Plaza Assocs., L.P. v. L.A.G. Enterprises, 28 Kan.App.2d 269, 272, 16 P.3d 314 (2000) (citing Kelty v. Best Cabs, Inc., 206 Kan. 654, 659, 481 P.2d 980 (1971); Rockey v. Bacon, 205 Kan. 578, 583, 470 P.2d 804 (1970)).[5] Defendants spent very little time on this issue at trial. They presented no evidence regarding any specific jobs that might have been available to Ms. O'Tool and, in contrast, plaintiffs presented evidence reflecting that Ms. O'Tool did, in fact, attempt to find alternative employment but was unsuccessful. Ultimately, defendants simply failed to carry their burden on the mitigation issue.
Defendants further contend that the jury's calculation of Ms. O'Tool's lost MIP earnings was inaccurate. Consistent with the evidence presented by plaintiffs at trial, the jury apparently awarded Ms. O'Tool approximately $11,000 in lost MIP earnings, *1266 representing 20 percent of Ms. O'Tool's salary. Significantly, defendants do not contest that Ms. O'Tool's employment agreement provided that her MIP compensation would be 20 percent of her salary assuming that both Genmar Holdings and Genmar Kansas met their operating profit goals. Moreover, defendants do not contest that 20 percent of Ms. O'Tool's salary over the relevant 15-month period at issue (the time of her termination through the time when Ms. O'Tool's employment contract would have expired) would be roughly $11,000.[6] Rather, defendants urge that the jury incorrectly assumed that both Genmar Holdings and Genmar Kansas would have met their operating profit goals during the relevant time frame-an assumption that defendants characterize as "clearly erroneous" in light of the fact that Genmar Kansas never reached the operating profits necessary to generate MIP payments.
Similarly, defendants contend that the jury improperly calculated Mr. O'Tool's lost MIP earnings when it awarded him $20,313. In that regard, the jury's verdict represents only lost MIP earnings as it was undisputed that Mr. O'Tool earned more money in his subsequent job than he would have earned if he had stayed at Genmar Kansas. Defendants do not dispute that Mr. O'Tool's employment contract provided that his MIP compensation would be 25 percent of his salary (assuming that both Genmar Holdings and Genmar Kansas met their operating profit goals). Defendants also do not dispute that the jury's verdict of $20,313 represents almost to the penny 25 percent of Mr. O'Tool's annual salary of $65,000 over the course of 15 months.[7] Again, defendants maintain only that the jury incorrectly assumed (or wildly speculated) that both Genmar Holdings and Genmar Kansas would have met their operating profit goals during the relevant time frame and that, in fact, Genmar Kansas never met the requisite profit goals.
Of course, defendants had the opportunity to make this argument to the jury and did, in fact, make this argument to the jury. The jury, as it was entitled to do, rejected this argument and plainly adopted plaintiffs' theory, thoroughly developed at trial, that Genmar Kansas would have reached its operating profit goals but for defendants' breach of their obligations under the purchase agreement, including their duty of good faith and fair dealing. In short, the jury's award of $63,200 to Ms. O'Tool and $20,313 to Mr. O'Tool does not shock the conscience of this court and, thus, no remittitur will be issued. See Dougan v. Rossville Drainage Dist, 270 Kan. 468, 486, 15 P.3d 338 (2000) (court has the power to issue a remittitur where a verdict is so manifestly excessive that it shocks the conscience of the court); see also Century 21 Real Estate Corp. v. Meraj Int'l Investment Corp., 315 F.3d 1271, 1281 (10th Cir.2003) (in assessing measure of damages awarded pursuant to contract containing choice of law provision, district court must follow chosen state's law-absent any argument that choice of law provision is unenforceable-including that state's law concerning remittitur).


*1267 D. Remaining Arguments in Support of New Trial

Finally, defendants assert that they are entitled to a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(a) in light of two "substantial errors of law" committed by the court. Specifically, defendants contend that the court erred in admitting parol evidence of the parties' negotiations prior to the execution of the purchase agreement and that the court erred in its instruction to the jury regarding the appropriate standard for determining whether defendants breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The court addresses each of these arguments in turn and, as explained below, rejects both arguments.

1. Admission of Parol Evidence
In their motion, defendants initially argue that the court erred when it admitted, over defendants' objection, parol evidence of the parties' negotiations to support plaintiffs' claim that they were fraudulently induced into executing the purchase agreement. Curiously, defendant concedes (in the same paragraph) that the law permits such evidence to prove fraudulent inducement. What defendants are really arguing is that parol evidence is inadmissible to prove bad faith in a breach of contract claim and that the jury should not have been permitted to consider evidence of the parties' negotiations (and, more specifically, oral assurances made to plaintiffs by defendants prior to the execution of the agreement) in connection with plaintiffs' claim that defendants breached the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.[8]
While defendants objected at trial to the admission of parol evidence concerning the parties' negotiations, they did not, once the court ruled that such evidence was clearly admissible with respect to plaintiffs' fraud claim, request a limiting instruction or even raise the issue of whether such evidence was admissible with respect to plaintiffs' breach of contract claim. In fact, defendants concede, as they must, that they failed to request a limiting instruction. Defendants, however, urge that parol evidence is a rule of substantive law that is not waived by the failure to object to its admission. See Carey v. Shellburne, Inc., 224 A.2d 400, 402 (Del.1966). While this is certainly time, there is nonetheless an evidentiary objection-relevance under Federal Rules of Evidence 401 and 402-that defendants should have made (and did not) if they desired to preclude the jury from considering such evidence with respect to plaintiffs' breach of contract claim. Because defendants failed to raise a timely objection to the admission of such evidence on that basis and request a limiting instruction, the court reviews the admission of the evidence under the "plain error" standard. See Fed.R.Evid. 103(d).
The court readily concludes that the admission of evidence concerning the parties' negotiations prior to executing the purchase agreement was not plain error. In fact, the point largely is moot because the court, even if defendants had brought the issue to the court's attention at trial, would have permitted the jury to consider such evidence in connection with plaintiffs' claim that defendants breached the implied covenant of good faith and fail" dealing. In other words, the court would have overruled any objection that defendants might have made in this regard.
*1268 The parol evidence rule requires the court to exclude "extraneous evidence that varies or contradicts the terms of a unified written instrument." True North Composites, LLC v. Trinity Indus., Inc., 191 F.Supp.2d 484, 514 (D.Del.2002) (citation omitted). Because defendants have not shown (much less argued) that the evidence presented at trial concerning the parties' negotiations varied or contradicted the terms of the purchase agreement, such evidence simply does not require invocation of the parol evidence rule. Moreover, because the purchase agreement was silent with respect to the majority of the issues discussed by the parties prior to the execution of the agreement (e.g., the number of Ranger boats that Genmar Kansas would be expected to produce or whether Genmar Kansas would be expected to produce any sister-brand boats at all), evidence concerning the parties' pre-acquisition negotiations is entirely appropriate to provide context for plaintiffs' claim that defendants breached their duty of good faith and fair dealing. See id. at 514-15 (denying motion for new trial based on court's alleged error in admitting parol evidence of transaction underlying written agreement because evidence provided context to good-faith-and-fair-dealing claims and testimony did not vary or contradict the terms of the agreement).
In other words, evidence concerning what the parties discussed prior to executing the agreement, to the extent such evidence, as here, does not contradict the agreement, is entirely relevant to whether defendants breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing because the parties' reasonable expectations at the time of the contract formation determine the reasonableness of the challenged conduct. See id. at 516 (evidence concerning course of dealings between the parties prior to execution of agreement was relevant to claim that party breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing because such evidence illuminated the parties' expectations of each other at the time of contract formation).
To conclude, then, defendants have not shown that the parol evidence rule required exclusion, at least for purposes of plaintiffs' breach of contract claim, of evidence concerning the parties' negotiations prior to the execution of the purchase agreement. The court rejects defendants' contention that it erred by allowing the jury to consider such evidence.

2. The Good Faith and Fair Dealing Instruction
Defendants' final argument in support of their motion for a new trial is that the court erred in its instruction to the jury concerning the duty of good faith and fair dealing. In its instructions, the court explained the duty, under Delaware law, as follows:
[T]he law imposes a duty of good faith and fair dealing in every contract. This duty is a contract term implied by courts to prevent one party from unfairly taking advantage of the other party. This duty includes a requirement that a party avoid hindering or preventing the other party's performance. The implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing emphasizes faithfulness to an agreed common purpose and consistency for the justified expectations of the other party. The parties' reasonable expectations at the time of the contract formation determines the reasonableness of the challenged conduct. A violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing implicitly indicates bad faith conduct.
In determining whether defendants breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, you may consider whether it is clear from what was expressly agreed upon by the parties that *1269 the parties would have agreed to prohibit the conduct complained of as a breach of the agreement had they thought to negotiate with respect to that matter.
See Jury Instruction 12. The court's instruction, in large part, was based on an instruction given by another federal court applying Delaware law concerning the duty of good faith and fair dealing, True North Composites, LLC v. Trinity Indus., Inc., 191 F.Supp.2d 484 (D.Del.2002). In True North, the court, faced with a motion for a new trial based an alleged errors in the good faith and fail dealing instruction, reviewed its instruction and found it to be "consonant with Delaware law." Id. at 517-18. Specifically, the court noted that its instruction "tracks the language of § 205(a) of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts (1979), which has been used by Delaware courts to explain the duty of good faith." Id. at 518.[9] In short, the court readily concluded that its instruction on the duty of good faith and fair dealing was not in error. Id.
Defendants urge, as they did at the instruction conference, that any proper instruction on the duty of good faith and fair dealing under Delaware law must require a finding that the conduct at issue involved "fraud, deceit or misrepresentation." Defendants' proposed instruction, for example, contained the following sentence that the court expressly rejected: "To prove defendants breached the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in the Purchase Agreement, plaintiffs must demonstrate that defendants engaged in conduct of fraud, deceit or misrepresentation." See Def. Proposed Instruction 5. This proffered language is derived from Corporate Property Associates 6 v. Hallwood Group Inc., 792 A.2d 993 (Del.Ch.2002), a trial court decision from the Court of Chancery in Delaware. In that case, a commercial dispute, the Vice Chancellor stated that a claimant seeking to prove a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing "must also demonstrate that the conduct at issue involved `an aspect of fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.'" Id. at 1003. At the instruction conference, defendants relied solely on the Corporate Property case to support their proffered instruction. Indeed, defendants did not direct the court to any other Delaware case-much less a Delaware Supreme Court case or a federal case interpreting Delaware law-in which a court required a finding of fraud, deceit or misrepresentation to support a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the context of a commercial transaction.
As the court explained at the conference, the trial court in Corporate Property cites only to Merrill v. Crothall-American, Inc., 606 A.2d 96, 101 (Del.1992) in support of the "fraud, deceit or misrepresentation" language. The Merrill case involved an employment-at-will contract and the court held that when the conduct of an employer in the employment-at-will context rises to the level of fraud, deceit or misrepresentation, then the employer will have violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Id. Interestingly, the Merrill court, in turn, relies on two cases from two other state courts in support of its conclusion that an element of fraud, deceit or misrepresentation must be present before an employer violates the covenant of good faith and fail' dealing. Id. Those cases, Magnan v. Anaconda Indus., Inc., 37 Conn.Supp. 38, 429 A.2d 492 (1980) and A. John Cohen Ins. v. Middlesex Ins. Co., 8 Mass.App.Ct. 178, 392 N.E.2d 862 (1979), *1270 both arise in the employment-at-will context.
In the limited and unique context of employment-at-will, requiring an employee to prove that his or her employer's conduct amounted to fraud in order to show a breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing is entirely consistent with the notion of an at-will employment relationship. For in the absence of a showing of fraud, the covenant of good faith and fair dealing could not operate in the employment-at-will context without wholly defeating the benefit for which the parties bargained-the employer's ability to discharge the employee and the employee's ability to quit his or her employment for good reason, bad reason or no reason at all. Stated another way, parties to an at-will employment relationship are generally not subjected to any good faith standard.[10] On the other hand, in the context of a commercial transaction like the one presented here, the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing-as it is typically applied (i.e., without a requirement of fraud)-does not conflict with the benefit for which parties to a commercial transaction generally bargain. For these reasons, the court reiterates its belief that the trial court in Corporate Property incorrectly incorporated into the commercial context the "fraud, deceit or misrepresentation" language from the employment-at-will context of Merrill.[11] Defendants, for the first time, now also cite to a Delaware Supreme Court case that they assert rejects the distinction that this court has drawn between the commercial context and employment-at-will context. Specifically, defendants rely on Cincinnati SMSA Limited Partnership v. Cincinnati Bell Cellular Systems Co., 708 A.2d 989 (Del.1998) and contend that in Cincinnati Bell the Delaware Supreme Court "made clear that the same standard applied by the Delaware court in Merrill should also be applied in the commercial contract context." Defendants' characterization of the Cincinnati Bell case is simply inaccurate; in fact, that case supports this court's conclusion that any requirement that a party prove fraudulent conduct to demonstrate a violation of the duty of good faith and fair dealing is limited to the employment-at-will context.
In Cincinnati Bell, the Delaware Supreme Court reviewed a decision by the Court of Chancery dismissing, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a good faith and fair dealing claim arising in the context of a limited partnership agreement. Id. at 990. Specifically, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's conclusion that the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing could not provide a basis for implying additional noncompete obligations in a limited partnership agreement where the agreement's noncompete clause was unambiguous. Id. at 993-94. In so holding, the Cincinnati Bell court emphasized that "implying obligations based on the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is a cautious enterprise." Id. at 992.
*1271 Tracing the development of the implied covenant under Delaware law, the court in Cincinnati Bell noted that the Merrill case was the first case in which the court "first recognized the limited application of the covenant to inducement representations in at-will employment contracts." Id. The Cincinnati Bell court further noted that in Merrill, the court "was careful to heed the legal right of employers to pursue a certain amount of self-interest in the creation of contractual relationships" and "held that, to plead properly a claim for breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the inducement of employment, a plaintiff must allege `an aspect of fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.'" Id. at 992-93 (quoting Merrill, 606 A.2d at 101-02). The court in the Cincinnati Bell case then stated, "[t]his Court should be no less cautious or exacting when asked to imply contractual obligations from the written text of a limited partnership agreement." Id. at 993. Defendants argue that this single sentence clearly illustrates an intent by the Delaware Supreme Court to incorporate the fraud standard of the employment-at-will context into the commercial transaction context. A full reading of Cincinnati Bell, however, indicates that the court was simply stressing the narrow scope of the implied covenant and that application of the covenant is a "cautious enterprise." Id. at 992-93. There is no indication in Cincinnati Bell that the court utilized the fraud standard of Merrill in resolving the appeal. In short, Cincinnati Bell in no way suggests that the jury in this case should have been instructed that plaintiffs were required to prove that defendants acted fraudulently in order to prove a breach of the implied covenant and, more importantly, the court believes that the Delaware Supreme Court, if faced with the issue, would refuse to adopt such a requirement.
Moreover, defendants' construction of Delaware law on good faith and fair dealing is illogical as it would render a good faith and fair dealing claim entirely duplicative of a fraud claim. In fact, defendants essentially contend that plaintiffs' good faith and fair dealing claim should be converted into one of fraud. Under defendants' theory, then, plaintiffs could not prevail on their good faith and fair dealing claim without also prevailing on their fraud claim. Any distinction, then, between the two claims would be lost. Such a result would be untenable, as the Delaware Supreme Court obviously recognizes a distinction between the two claims. See Desert Equities, Inc. v. Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund, II, L.P., 624 A.2d 1199, 1207-08 (Del.1993) (distinguishing claim of fraud from allegations of bad faith).
Finally, defendants contend that the court's instruction on the duty of good faith and fair dealing was erroneous because it failed to inform the jury that plaintiffs were required to show affirmative acts of bad faith on the part of defendants. The court's instruction advised the jury that a violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing "implicitly indicates bad faith conduct." While defendants may have preferred different language concerning bad faith, they have not identified how the court's instruction departs from or incompletely portrays Delaware law. Moreover, defendants have not demonstrated why plaintiffs' proof of a breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing is inadequate without further proof of affirmative acts of bad faith conduct. The court, then, rejects defendants' argument that the instruction was erroneous. See True North, 191 F.Supp.2d at 517-18 (rejecting argument that instruction was erroneous because it failed to advise that the claimant must prove that the other party acted in bad faith where movant failed to show how the court's instruction was inconsistent with Delaware law).


*1272 11. Plaintiffs' Motion to Alter or Amend the Judgment
The judgment entered on November 21, 2002 states that plaintiffs Horizon and Mr. Pepper shall recover on their breach of contract claim "the sum of $2,500,000.00, with interest thereon at the rate of 1.46 percent per annum as provided by law." Plaintiffs move to alter or amend the judgment to reflect the parties' contractually agreed interest rate of 2 percent per month.[12] In that regard, the relevant section of the purchase agreement executed by the parties states as follows:
In the event that the Non-Defaulting Party is entitled to receive an amount of money by reason of the Defaulting Party's default hereunder, then, in addition to such amount of money, the Defaulting Party shall promptly pay to the Non-Defaulting Party a sum equal to interest on such amount of money accruing at the rate of 2% per month (but if such rate is not permitted under the laws of the State of Delaware, then at the highest rate which is permitted to be paid under the laws of the State of Delaware) during the period between the date such payment should have been made hereunder and the date of the actual payment thereof.
See Purchase Agreement, Section 13.2(b) (Trial Exhibit 227a). Defendants oppose plaintiffs' motion for three reasons. According to defendants, the contractual rate of interest specified in the purchase agreement is preempted by the standard rate contained in 28 U.S.C. § 1961; plaintiffs have waived their right to have the judgment accrue interest at the parties' contractually agreed rate; and the contractually agreed rate is not permitted under Delaware law. As set forth below, the court concludes that parties are free to contract for a rate other than that specified in 28 U.S.C. § 1961 and, thus, the federal statute does not supersede the parties' agreement. Nonetheless, because the court concludes that plaintiffs have waived their right to assert the rate set forth in the purchase agreement by not preserving their claim of entitlement to such rate in the pretrial order and by failing to raise the issue until after the entry of judgment, the court denies plaintiffs' motion to alter or amend the judgment to the extent plaintiffs seek to enforce the rate established in the purchase agreement.

A. Whether Section 1961 Supersedes the Contractually Agreed Rate
Defendants contend that 28 U.S.C. § 1961, the federal statute governing post-judgment interest, must govern the award of post-judgment interest in this case despite the parties' contractual agreement for a different rate. Section 1961 states, in relevant part, that "[i]nterest shall be allowed on any money judgment in a civil case recovered in district court" and that [s]uch interest shall be calculated from the date of the entry of the judgment, at a rate equal to the coupon issue yield equivalent (as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury) of the average accepted auction price for the last auction of the fifty-two week United States Treasury bills settled immediately prior to the date of the judgment." 28 U.S.C. § 1961(a).
In support of their argument, defendants direct the court to Wilmington Trust Co. v. Aerovias de Mexico, S.A. de C.V., 893 F.Supp. 215, 220 (S.D.N.Y.1995), *1273 where the court calculated post-judgment interest at the section 1961 rate despite a contractual agreement providing for a higher rate. In that case, the district court simply stated that the language of section 1961(a) is mandatory and must govern the interest rate on any judgment debt:
The language of [section 1961(a) ] is mandatory: once a claim is reduced to judgment, the original claim is extinguished, and a new claim, called a judgment debt, arises. Section 1961(a) governs the interest rate on this judgment debt. Carte Blanche (Singapore) v. Carte Blanche (Int.), 888 F.2d 260 (2d Cir.1989), citing Kotsopoulos v. Asturia Shipping Co., 467 F.2d 91 (2d Cir.1972).
Id. at 220-21. The Wilmington case, however, is not entirely helpful for purposes of this court's analysis of whether parties can contract for a rate of interest different from the rate set forth in section 1961(a). In that regard, the district court in Wilmington did not expressly address whether the parties could contract around the federal statute. Rather, the court seemed to assume that the parties would not be permitted to do so under Second Circuit precedent. However, Carte Blanche and Kotsopoulos, the Second Circuit cases upon which the Wilmington court relies, do not stand for the proposition that parties cannot contract for a different rate of interest. In Kotsopoulos, a maritime case, the issue before the Second Circuit was only whether state law or federal law would determine the appropriate rate of post-judgment interest in admiralty and maritime cases. See 467 F.2d at 94-95. Similarly, the Second Circuit in Carte Blanche did not address whether parties to a contract could provide for a rate different than the standard rate set forth in section 1961(a). There, the Circuit held that an arbitrator could not impose a postjudgment interest rate different than the rate established in section 1961(a). See 888 F.2d at 268-69 (district court judgment affirming an arbitration award is governed by section 1961(a) rather than rate set forth in arbitration award).
Plaintiffs, on the other hand, urge that nearly every Circuit Court of Appeals to have addressed this issue has concluded that the parties can agree to an interest rate other than the standard one contained in 28 U.S.C. § 1961. For example, the Seventh Circuit in Central States, Southeast & Southwest Areas Pension Fund v. Bomar National, Inc., 253 F.3d 1011 (7th Cir.2001), affirmed a district court's award of post-judgment interest pursuant to the rate agreed upon in a pension trust agreement rather than the standard rate contained in section 1961(a). In so doing, the Seventh Circuit stated that "[i]t is well established that parties can agree to an interest rate other than the standard one contained in 28 U.S.C. § 1961." Id. at 1020. In support of its statement, the Seventh Circuit cites to the Fifth Circuit's decision in Hymel v. UNC, Inc., 994 F.2d 260, 265 (5th Cir.1993).
In Hymel, the Fifth Circuit "noted" that the district court was correct when it awarded post-judgment interest at a rate of 9 percent per annum pursuant to express language contained in a promissory note executed by the parties. Id. at 265-66. The Circuit summarily rejected the argument that section 1961 applies in every case without exception and, in doing so, cited to another Fifth Circuit case, In re Lift & Equipment Service, Inc., 816 F.2d 1013 (5th Cir.1987). See id. In In re Lift, a case arising out of the bankruptcy court, the parties disputed whether the creditor was entitled to post-judgment interest under Louisiana law or under section 1961(a), 816 F.2d at 1018. The Fifth Circuit, however, rejected both arguments and, embracing a view that none of the parties had espoused, applied the interest *1274 rate set forth in the written assignment of accounts receivable. Id. In so doing, the Circuit stated, "While 28 U.S.C. § 1961 provides a standard rate of post-judgment interest, the parties are free to stipulate a different rate, consistent with state usury and other applicable laws." Id.
While the Fifth Circuit in In re Lift offered no explanation for its conclusion, it cited to a Ninth Circuit decision, Investment Service Co. v. Allied Equities Corp., 519 F.2d 508 (9th Cir.1975). In that case, the district court judge applied the interest rate agreed upon by the parties in a promissory note. Id. at 511. The guarantor of the loan argued that the assignee of the note was only entitled to the legal rate of interest under Oregon state law. See id. The Ninth Circuit rejected the argument:
It is true that the contractual duty here is discharged by merger once the judgment is entered on the note. Restatement of Contracts § 444. However, upon entry of the judgment the legal rate of interest applicable should apply unless the parties have agreed in the note that some other rate of interest shall apply. Corbin on Contracts § 1045 (1962).
Id. The court's reliance on Corbin, however, is somewhat puzzling in that Corbin does not purport to draw any conclusion about the effect of a judgment on the parties' contractual agreement to a different rate and it does not address a contractual agreement for post-judgment interest; rather, the section cited by the Ninth Circuit deals only with the payment of interest as "agreed compensation" for a breach of the contract. See Arthur Linton, Corbin on Contracts § 1045 (Interim ed.2002) (expressly stating that section 1045 addresses neither a contract right to interest nor statutory rights thereto, but only interest recoverable as compensatory damages for a breach of contract). In any event, the court ultimately applied Oregon's legal-rate-of-interest statute, which specifically provides that parties to a contract can agree to a higher rate of interest provided that such rate does not exceed the maximum rate allowed by law. See id.
The court concedes at the outset that the cases relied upon by plaintiffs, to the extent those cases purport to stand for a well-recognized rule that parties are free to contract for an interest rate other than the rate established in section 1961(a), are problematic in certain respects. In large part, the cases offer very little analysis as to why parties would be able to contract around the seemingly mandatory language of section 1961(a). Moreover, in several of the cases, the precise issue was not one that the court had to decide and, thus, any conclusions about the issue would be mere dicta. Nonetheless, it is clear that the Seventh, Fifth and Ninth Circuits consider it beyond dispute that parties are free to contract for whatever post-judgment interest rate they choose. In addition, the Fourth Circuit, albeit in an unpublished decision, expressly adopted the Fifth Circuit's Hymel decision in affirming a district court's award of post-judgment interest at a rate set forth in a stock redemption agreement as opposed to the rate set forth in section 1961(a). See Carolina Pizza Huts, Inc. v. Woodward, 67 F.3d 294, 1995 WL 572902, at *3 (4th Cir.1995). Moreover, at least one district court has declined to award post-judgment interest at the section 1961(a) rate where the parties stipulated to the entry of a judgment which provided for interest at a higher rate. See In re Connaught Properties, Inc., 176 B.R. 678, 684-85 (Bankr.D.Conn.1995).
In the end, the court is called upon to resolve a difficult legal issue on which the Tenth Circuit has not been called to opinean issue that is rendered that much more difficult in light of the dearth of on-point *1275 analysis by other courts. After carefully weighing both sides of the issue, the court ultimately believes that the Tenth Circuit would likely concur with those Circuits that have held that parties should be and are able to contract for a rate other than the rate set forth in section 1961(a). While section 1961 without a doubt uses mandatory language, the court concludes that Congress intended it to be mandatory in the sense that a district court or other third party (e.g., an arbitrator) has no discretion to award a different rate of interest or to decline to award post-judgment interest. See, e.g., Bell, Boyd & Lloyd v. Tapy, 896 F.2d 1101, 1104 (7th Cir.1990) (section 1961(a) allows the judge no discretion to deny the interest authorized by that section); Carte Blanche, 888 F.2d at 269 (the language of section 1961 is mandatory and its terms do not permit the exercise of judicial discretion in its application). The court, however, can discern no sound reason why Congress would have intended that parties themselves could not agree to a different rate. Thus, the court rejects defendants' contention that section 1961(a) supersedes the rate agreed upon by the parties in the purchase agreement.

B. Whether Plaintiffs Waived the Right to Assert, the Contractually Agreed Rate
Defendants also oppose plaintiffs' motion to alter or amend on the grounds that plaintiffs waived the right to assert the 2% per month rate by failing to include that rate in the pretrial order. Plaintiffs concede that they did not articulate in the pretrial order their claim of entitlement to a higher rate of post-judgment interest. Nonetheless, plaintiffs contend that no such claim needed to be asserted in the pretrial order. As explained below, the court disagrees with plaintiffs on this point.
In their papers, plaintiffs rely to a large extent on the legal principles that an award of post-judgment interest is mandatory, see Bancamerica Commercial Corp. v. Mosher Steel of Kansas, Inc., 103 F.3d 80, 81 (10th Cir.1996), and, as such, must be made regardless of what was demanded in the complaint or stated in the pretrial order. See Bell, Boyd & Lloyd v. Tapy, 896 F.2d 1101, 1104 (7th Cir.1990); 10 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2664 at 186-87 (1998). However, the issue is not whether plaintiffs were required to request post-judgment interest in the pretrial order to receive an award of post-judgment interest. The law is clear (and defendants do not dispute) that plaintiffs are entitled to post-judgment interest, at least at the rate established in 28 U.S.C. § 1961(a), despite their failure to request such an award in the pretrial order. The issue as this court sees it is whether plaintiffs are entitled to an award of post-judgment interest at the higher rate of interest specified in the purchase agreement when no such request was made in the pretrial order.
It is axiomatic that a Rule 59(e) motion cannot be used to raise a new issue that could have been raised prior to judgment. See Steele v. Young, 11 F.3d 1518, 1520 n. 1 (10th Cir.1993); 11 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2810.1 (2d ed.1995). In other words, Rule 59(e) is "aimed at re consideration, not initial consideration" and, thus, a party may not rely on Rule 59(e) to raise an argument which could, and should, have been made before judgment issued. United States ex rel, Noyes v. Kimberly Constr., Inc., 43 Fed.Appx. 283, 286-87 (10th Cir.2002) (emphasis in original). Despite plaintiffs' insistence that they did not need to raise the issue prior to judgment, *1276 it is beyond dispute that plaintiffs could have raised the issue prior to judgment. Unlike an award of postjudgment interest pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1961, the award sought by plaintiffs here was not necessarily a "given." In that regard, while defendants assert only legal arguments in opposition to plaintiffs' claim of entitlement to the higher rate of interest, it is possible that defendants could have sought to raise factual arguments in opposition to the claim. For example, defendants could have asserted that section 13.2(b) was altered by plaintiffs after the contract was signed.[13] Had defendants so asserted, then they would have been entitled to have the jury resolve that dispute. Because a court is not permitted to give relief under Rule 59(e) "if this would defeat a party's right to jury trial on an issue," see Wright, Miller & Kane, supra, § 2810.1, then the fact that one in the place of defendants might have had fact-based defenses available renders plaintiffs' request for award of postjudgment interest pursuant to the purchase agreement the type of request that cannot be raised for the first time pursuant to Rule 59(e).
According to plaintiffs, defendants were nonetheless on notice that plaintiffs would assert a claim of entitlement to an award of postjudgment interest at the higher rate because defendants executed the purchase agreement and are charged with knowledge of the contents of that agreement. The court finds this argument disingenuous as it is clear that plaintiffs themselves did not remember (or perhaps even recognize) that the purchase agreement provided for a higher rate of interest until very late in the litigation process. Indeed, section 13.2(b) provides not only for postjudgment interest, but prejudgment interest-a remedy that plaintiffs failed to request at any time during the course of the litigation (and a remedy that plaintiffs acknowledge they cannot now seek). Plaintiffs' failure in that regard demonstrates to the court that they were not aware of or did not remember the contents of section 13.2(b). Moreover, while section 13.2(a) provides for a prevailing party to recover reasonable attorneys fees, plaintiffs did not assert a claim for fees in the pretrial order. This also demonstrates to the court the likelihood that plaintiffs had not considered the contents of section 13.2 in connection with this case at any time prior to entry of the pretrial order. Only after defendants asserted in the pretrial order a right to recover fees did plaintiffs scour the purchase agreement looking for the source of defendants' claim. At that point, after the entry of the pretrial order, plaintiffs moved to amend the pretrial order to assert a claim for fees. The court granted that motion because defendants, who had asserted a claim for the recovery of fees pursuant to the purchase agreement, were not prejudiced by the addition of that claim in that they clearly had knowledge of that portion of the contract and they had not demonstrated that plaintiffs' right to recover fees would affect the trial of the case in any way.
The court concludes that defendants were entitled to notice from plaintiffs-prior to trial and, hopefully, at least by the date of entry of the final pretrial order-that plaintiffs intended to seek postjudgment interest at the contractual rate. Such notice would have enabled defendants to ascertain *1277 whether they had any good faith factual arguments to raise in the face of section 13.2(b)-factual arguments that could have been presented to the jury. Moreover, such notice would have permitted defendants to assess fully the risk of bringing this case to trial. More specifically, defendants would have been able to ascertain the total potential exposure that they might face if the jury, as they did, returned a verdict in favor of plaintiffs. Indeed, the interest rate set forth in the contract-2 percent per month-would expose defendants to an additional $600,000 per year in indebtedness to plaintiffs on a verdict of $2.5 million, assuming the jury's verdict is upheld on appeal. In short, the court believes that defendants were entitled to actual notice that plaintiffs' recovery might encompass this significant amount.
In sum, plaintiffs' motion to alter or amend the judgment is denied to the extent plaintiffs seek an award of post-judgment interest pursuant to the interest rate set forth in the parties' purchase agreement.

C. Whether Delaware Law Prohibits Application of the Contractually Agreed Rate
Because the court denies plaintiffs' motion on the grounds that plaintiffs waived their right to assert the higher interest rate found in the purchase agreement, the court need not address defendants' argument that the higher rate is not permitted under Delaware law. Nonetheless, in the interest of judicial economy in the event the parties' appeal this court's decision to the Tenth Circuit, the court notes, without elaborating in full detail, that it would conclude that the higher rate established in the contract is permissible under Delaware law.
The Delaware law governing post-judgment interest is codified at section 2301 of Title 6 of the Delaware Code and states, in relevant part, as follows:
Any lender may charge and collect from a borrower interest at any rate agreed upon in writing not in excess of 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate including any surcharge thereon, and judgments entered after May 13, 1980, shall bear interest at the rate in the contract sued upon. Where there is no expressed contract rate, the legal rate of interest shall be 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate including any surcharge as of the time from which interest is due; provided, that where the time from which interest is due predates April 18, 1980, the legal rate shall remain as it was at such time.
Id. § 2301(a). The court agrees with defendants that section 2301(a) clearly provides that no interest rate can exceed 5% over the federal discount rate and rejects plaintiffs' argument that because the judgment in this case was entered after May 13, 1980, section 2301(a) permits interest to accrue at a contractually agreed rate.
However, as plaintiffs highlight in their papers, section 2301(c) expressly provides that there is "no limitation on the rate of interest which may be legally charged for the loan or use of money, where the amount of money loaned or used exceeds $100,000, and where repayment thereof is not secured by a mortgage against the principal residence of any borrower." While defendants urge that this provision does not apply because it is limited to the context of a unsecured loan between a lender and a borrower, section 2301(a) on its face would also appear to apply only to lenders and borrowers. Thus, if subsection (a) applies to the purchase agreement (as defendants urge that it does), then subsection (c) would have to apply as well. In any event, defendants are precluded under Delaware law from challenging the *1278 contractual rate as usurious. See Del. Code. tit. 6 § 2306 ("No corporation ... or limited liability company ... shall interpose the defense of usury in any action.").
For these reasons, the court would conclude that the rate of interest agreed upon by the parties in the purchase agreement is not prohibited by Delaware law.

III. Plaintiffs' Motion for Attorneys' Fees, Costs and Expenses
The purchase agreement executed by the parties provides that the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the defaulting party all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred in connection with enforcing the terms of the purchase agreement. See Purchase Agreement, Section 13.2(a) (Trial Exhibit 227a). Pursuant to this provision of the contract, and having prevailed on their breach of contract claim, plaintiffs Horizon and Mr. Pepper seek attorneys' fees and expenses totaling $846,740.35.[14] As set forth below, with the exception of a few minor adjustments, the court grants plaintiffs' motion.[15]
The parties have stipulated to the reasonableness of all billing rates and, thus, the court need not address that issue. To the extent defendants do oppose plaintiffs' fee request, that opposition is both exceedingly narrow and easily resolved. Defendants assert that plaintiffs' request is simply too exorbitant because of the "limited success" achieved by plaintiffs at trial. To be clear, defendants have not articulated any objections to any specific portion of the fee request or plaintiffs' billing records and they do not contest any specific time entries. Instead, defendants assert only a general objection to the fee request as unreasonable. Indeed, in the face of a request for nearly $850,000 in fees and expenses, defendants have submitted a brief that is less than 9 pages in length.
Defendants suggest in their papers that they are relieved of the burden of objecting to specific portions of plaintiffs' fee request because, according to defendants, plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of showing that the request is reasonable. The court disagrees. To meet their burden of proving the number of hours reasonably spent on the litigation, plaintiffs "must submit meticulous, contemporaneous time records that reveal, for each lawyer for whom fees are sought, all hours for which compensation is requested and how those hours were allotted to specific tasks." United Phosphorus, Ltd. v. *1279 Midland Fumigant, Inc., 205 F.3d 1219, 1233 (10th Cir.2000) (citing Case v. Unified Sch. Dist. No. 233, 157 F.3d 1243, 1249-50 (10th Cir.1998)). The district court, then, may reduce the number of hours when the time records provided to the court are inadequate. Id. at 1233-34. The court has reviewed the billing records submitted by plaintiffs and those records are more than adequate to meet plaintiffs' burden.
Defendants also invite the court to dissect plaintiffs' billing records in an effort to determine or "approximate" those fees that are attributable to the breach of contract claim and those fees that are attributable to the unsuccessful claims. The court, however, is not obligated to comb the record to ferret out deficiencies in plaintiffs' submission. It is defendants' obligation to direct the court to such deficiencies if they believe such deficiencies exist. See Public Serv. Co. of Colorado v. Continental Casualty Co., 26 F.3d 1508, 1521 (10th Cir.1994) ("We do not feel that the trial judge was obligated to comb the evidence before him-consisting of voluminous attorney billing records-to ferret out gaps or inconsistencies in the evidence presented on the fees."); see also United States ex rel. C.J.C., Inc. v. Western States Mechanical Contractors, Inc., 834 F.2d 1533, 1549 (10th Cir.1987) ("[T]he trial court is not responsible for independently calculating a `reasonable' fee."). Nonetheless, the court has reviewed the billing records and, in large part, concludes that plaintiffs' fee request is a reasonable one. The court will, however, deduct from plaintiffs' request fees of $67.50 for work performed by attorney Normal Siegel on April 15, 2002 and fees of $585.00 for work performed by attorney Amy Baumann on August 14, 2002. It is apparent from plaintiffs' papers that they intended to deduct these fees from their request (and to request fees for attorney time only to the extent work was done by the two primary lawyers involved in the case-George Hanson and Todd McGuire) but, presumably by oversight, neglected to do so. Similarly, the court will deduct fees of $3195.00 incurred during July 2002 in connection with plaintiffs' motion to compel discovery. Again, plaintiffs' papers indicate that they intended to deduct these fees from their request, having already recovered this sum from defendants by virtue of this court's July 25, 2002 order, but the billing records indicate that this deduction was not, in fact, made.
To reiterate, then, aside from these minor deductions, the court has reviewed the billing records and, in the absence of any specific objection to plaintiffs' request and in the absence of any evidence that the hours claimed by plaintiffs are unreasonable, concludes that plaintiffs' fee request is a reasonable one. See Robinson v. City of Edmond, 160 F.3d 1275, 1279, 1285-86 (10th Cir.1998) (plaintiffs requested $186,000 in fees and defendants generally objected to this request as unreasonable but specifically articulated objections to only $43,000 of the request, leaving $142,000 in requested attorney's fees "not separately contested;" district court abused its discretion in reducing fee award in part because the end result was a fee award that was below the "unrebutted," "unchallenged," and "uncontested" amount of the fee request); Sheets v. Salt Lake County, 45 F.3d 1383 (10th Cir.1995) (affirming trial court's fee award in part because defendants failed to proffer any evidence that the hours claimed were unreasonable and, instead, simply made unsubstantiated allegations that the fees were duplicative and exorbitant in nature).
Defendants' general objection to plaintiffs' request is that the request is simply unreasonable in light of plaintiffs' "limited success"-plaintiffs prevailed only on their "relatively simple" contract claim. In the context of this litigation, however, a verdiet *1280 of $2.5 million is a substantial victory for plaintiffs and there was nothing "simple" about the contract claim. Rather, the case presented complex commercial issues and plaintiffs' counsel successfully developed those issues at trial. Indeed, Mr. Pepper and Horizon's breach of contract claim-the claim on which plaintiffs ultimately succeeded-encompassed a claim that defendants had breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, a claim that is often difficult for judges and lawyers to comprehend let alone lay persons on a jury. To prove plaintiffs' claim at trial, plaintiffs' counsel could not rely on an express term of the contract and could not point to one specific act that constituted defendants' breach. Instead, counsel was required to convey to the jury that defendants' entire course of conduct (conduct that spanned over 18 months) breached an "implied" duty to act in "good faith." Despite the sheer volume of evidence needed to describe and place in context defendants' course of conduct, coupled with the need to fit that evidence into amorphous concepts like "good faith" and "implied duty," plaintiffs' counsel achieved a multimillion dollar verdict for his clients. For these reasons, the court readily concludes (and defendants cannot seriously dispute) that plaintiffs obtained excellent results at trial. See Hampton v. Dillard Dep't Stores, Inc., 247 F.3d 1091, 1120 (10th Cir.2001) (proper focus is on the overall relief obtained). No blanket reduction is warranted and plaintiffs' counsel is deserving of a fully compensatory fee. See Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433-35, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983).
In a related vein, defendants contend that plaintiffs are only permitted to recover those reasonable fees and expenses incurred in connection with the pursuit of their contract claim. Defendants contend that plaintiffs are improperly attempting to recover fees and expenses associated with the numerous claims on which plaintiffs did not prevail at trial and that the time and labor required to present evidence to the jury that defendants breached the purchase agreement was "only a small part of that actually expended by plaintiffs' counsel." The court rejects this argument, too. As an initial matter, plaintiffs' papers demonstrate that plaintiffs' counsel have already excluded from their request those hours associated with discrete research and other work related to plaintiffs' statutory discrimination claims, including hours spent working with plaintiffs' expert witness concerning plaintiffs' potential damages under Title VII. See Robinson, 160 F.3d at 1281 (prevailing party must make a good faith effort to exclude from request those hours that are excessive, redundant or otherwise unnecessary).
In any event, in light of the fact that most, if not all, of the unsuccessful claims were intertwined with the successful breach of contract claim through a common core of fact or related legal theories, any reduction of fees would be inappropriate. See id. at 1283 (reversing district court's reduction of fee award on the grounds that plaintiffs achieved only partial success where all unsuccessful claims were intertwined with the successful claims). The law is clear that when a lawsuit consists of related claims, a plaintiff who has won substantial relief should not have his attorney's fee reduced simply because the court or jury did not adopt each contention raised. See Hampton, 247 F.3d at 1120 (citing Jane L. v. Bangerter, 61 F.3d 1505, 1512 (10th Cir.1995)) (affirming district court's refusal to reduce fee award based on alleged limited success; all of the claims were similar and stemmed from the same set of facts). Indeed, the Supreme Court has cautioned that a court should exclude an unsuccessful claim from a fee award only if that claim is "distinct in *1281 all respects" from the successful claim. See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 440, 103 S.Ct. 1933.
Utilizing this standard (a standard that defendants do not even reference in their papers), the court simply cannot conclude that any of plaintiffs' unsuccessful claims are unrelated to the pursuit of the ultimate result achieved. Indeed, any attempt to divide the hours expended in this case on a claim-by-claim basis would be difficult and unjust. Nearly all of the claims pursued by plaintiffs-particularly plaintiffs' fraud and breach of contract claims-centered on the same core of facts. Any investigation or development of the fraud claim would necessarily have encompassed plaintiffs' breach of contract claim (and vice versa) as both claims required careful scrutiny of the parties' pre-contractual negotiations and the parties' conduct throughout the course of the contractual relationship. Thus, it is not surprising to this court that the billing records of plaintiffs' counsel, in large part, do not distinguish between claims. See id. at 435, 103 S.Ct. 1933 ("Much of counsel's time will be devoted generally to the litigation as a whole, making it difficult to divide the hours expended on a claim-by-claim basis."). Moreover, the Tenth Circuit has emphasized the importance of allowing litigants the "breathing room" necessary to raise alternative legal grounds that seek the same result and, thus, focusing on the actual result of the trial rather than dividing attorneys' fees by the number of successful claims. See Robinson, 160 F.3d at 1283.
For the foregoing reasons, the court rejects defendants' contention that a blanket reduction of fees is warranted and, with the exception of the minor adjustments noted above, grants plaintiffs' motion for fees and costs and expenses.
IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED BY THE COURT THAT plaintiffs' motion to alter or amend the judgment (doc. # 197) is granted in part and denied in part. Specifically, the motion is granted to the extent that a typographical error in the judgment shall be corrected and is otherwise denied; plaintiffs' motion for attorneys' fees, costs and expenses (doc. # 198) is granted in part and denied in part and the court awards plaintiffs fees, costs and expenses in the amount of $842,-892.85; and defendants' renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50(b) or, in the alternative, motion for remittitur and/or new trial pursuant to Rule 59 (doc. # 199) is denied.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED BY THE COURT THAT the clerk of the court shall amend the judgment to reflect this court's award of $842,892.85 in attorneys' fees, costs and expenses. The amended judgment should also be corrected to reflect that the jury returned a verdict on November 21, 2002 as opposed to November 12, 2002.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
NOTES
[1]  The parties do not dispute that Delaware law governs plaintiffs' claim that defendants breached the terms of the purchase agreement, as that agreement contains an express choice-of-law provision.
[2]  The undisputed evidence at trial was that "standard cost" was the amount that it actually cost Genmar Kansas to build the boat in terms of labor, material and overhead. In other words, Genmar Kansas was not making any profit on Ranger or Crestliner boats and, in most instances, was actually losing money on these boats because Genmar Kansas was not operating at maximum efficiency. Profits on these boats that were built on the production line in the Genmar Kansas facility were earned by Ranger and Crestliner when they in turn sold the boats to their dealer network.
[3]  Lowe is another aluminum boat manufacturing company. Mr. Pepper worked for Lowe for nearly ten years; ultimately Lowe was purchased by defendants.
[4]  In their papers, defendants also assert that section 4 of the employment agreements supports their argument that the O'Tools were not guaranteed a specific term of employment. Defendants, however, have not mentioned section 4 at any time prior to filing their renewed motion and certainly did not highlight this section for the jury.
[5]  The parties do not dispute that Kansas law governs the O'Tools' breach of contract claims as the O'Tools' employment contracts contained a provision identifying Kansas law as the parties' choice of law.
[6]  In their papers, defendants assert that 20 percent of Ms. O'Tool's salary is only $8320. That figure, however, is based on Ms. O'Tool's annual salary of $41,600 instead of the total salary that Ms. O'Tool would have earned over the relevant 15-month period.
[7]  When Mr. O'Tool's annual salary is translated into a monthly salary, and that monthly salary is multiplied by 15 months (measured from the time of Mr. O'Tool's discharge through the time when Mr. O'Tool's employment contract would have expired), his total lost salary is $81,249.90 (65,000/12 = $5,416.66 per month x 15). Twenty-five percent of $81,249.90 is $20,312.47.
[8]  This argument presupposes that the jury considered such evidence in connection with plaintiffs' breach of contract claim. Defendants, of course, have no way of knowing that the jury did, in fact, consider such evidence in its assessment of the breach of contract claim.
[9]  While the court in True North referenced § 205(a) of the Restatement (Second), that Restatement does not contain a § 205(a); the court intended to reference comment a of § 205.
[10]  For this reason, many states, including Kansas, have held that there is simply no implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the employment-at-will context. See, e.g., St. Catherine Hosp. of Garden City v. Rodriguez, 25 Kan.App.2d 763, 765, 971 P.2d 754 (1998) (Kansas does not recognize any good faith obligation in the employment-at-will context) (citing cases).
[11]  It may be that the court in Corporate Property was simply using the fraud language as a short-hand for the concept of bad faith. The point, however, is that the court fails to explain why it is utilizing that language and fails to provide any insight into the significance, if any, of that language, such as whether a party bringing a good faith and fair dealing claim would be held to proving the elements of fraud (e.g., false representation, scienter and reliance) in order to prevail.
[12]  In their motion to alter or amend, plaintiffs also point out that the judgment entered on November 21, 2002 contains a typographical error in that the judgment states that the verdict was returned by the jury on November 12, 2002. The jury, however, returned its verdict on November 21, 2002. The judgment will be corrected, and plaintiffs' motion will be granted, in this respect.
[13]  No one, of course, is suggesting that plaintiffs did so; the court is simply posing a hypothetical for illustrative purposes to demonstrate that there might have been factbased defenses available to defendants had the issue been raised by plaintiffs. Thus, because plaintiffs were not necessarily automatically entitled to the higher rate, the court rejects plaintiffs' contention that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(c) requires an award of post-judgment interest at the higher rate irrespective of the contents of the pretrial order.
[14]  Plaintiffs' fee request covers the time period ending December 31, 2002. To the extent plaintiffs intend to recover fees, costs and expenses incurred in January 2003 in connection with responding to defendants' motion for judgment as a matter of law and filing their initial fee application, plaintiffs must file a motion for a supplemental award of fees, as those figures are not presently before the court. To the extent plaintiffs intend to seek fees in connection with defending an appeal filed by defendants, plaintiffs must direct such a request to the Tenth Circuit. See, e.g., San Juan Prods., Inc. v. San Juan Pools of Kansas, Inc., 849 F.2d 468, 477 (10th Cir.1988).
[15]  Because plaintiffs' fee request stems from a contractual fee provision, plaintiffs' request is subject to far less scrutiny than a request made pursuant to a fee-shifting statute and the court does not possess the same degree of equitable discretion to deny such fees as it has when applying a statute providing for a discretionary award. See United States ex rel. C.J.C, Inc. v. Western States Mechanical Contractors, Inc., 834 F.2d 1533, 1547-50 (10th Cir.1987) (remanding claim for attorneys' fees made pursuant to contractual fee provision where district court reduced the fee and, in doing so, applied the wrong standard and scrutinized the fee request too closely). In such cases, fees are "routinely awarded" unless the trial court determines that an award consistent with the request would be inequitable or unreasonable. Id. at 1548.

1
For 12 years, John Serpico and Maria Busillo held and abused various influential positions with the Central States Joint Board ("CSJB"), a labor organization that provides support to its member unions. Among other responsibilities, Serpico and Busillo controlled the management of the unions' money. The pair, along with longtime friend and business associate Gilbert Cataldo, collaborated on three schemes involving the misappropriation of the unions' funds. Two of those schemes are the focus of this appeal by Serpico and Cataldo (Busillo has not appealed her conviction).


2
In their "loans-for-deposits" scheme, Serpico and Busillo deposited large sums of union money in various banks. In exchange, the two received overly generous terms and conditions on personal loans totaling more than $5 million. In the more complicated hotel loan kickback scheme, several groups entered into the 51 Associates Limited Partnership, which planned to construct a hotel. The partnership was unable to obtain financing for the construction of the building without first securing a commitment for a mortgage loan that would guarantee repayment of the construction loan after the hotel was built. Serpico used union funds to make a mortgage loan to the developers, after which Mid-City Bank agreed to make the construction loan. In exchange for Serpico's help in securing the loan, 51 Associates paid $333,850 to Cataldo's corporation, Taylor West & Company, for "consulting services" that Cataldo never actually performed. Cataldo then kicked back $25,000 to Serpico by paying Serpico's share of a $50,000 investment into an unrelated business project (the Studio Network project) in which the two were partners.


3
Serpico, Busillo, and Cataldo were tried on charges of racketeering, mail fraud, and bank fraud. At the close of the evidence, the court granted motions by Serpico and Busillo for acquittal on the racketeering and bank fraud counts. The jury convicted Serpico and Busillo on mail fraud charges relating to the loans-for-deposits scheme and Serpico and Cataldo on mail fraud charges for the hotel loan kickback scheme.


4
At sentencing, the district court determined that Serpico and Cataldo were each responsible for a loss of $333,850, the amount paid to Cataldo, for the hotel loan kickback scheme. For the loans-for-deposits scheme, the court found the damage to the unions to be equal to the additional amount of interest the union assets would have earned had Serpico purchased CDs at banks offering the highest interest rates instead of those offering him special deals on his personal loans. The court totaled loans from Capitol Bank as well as six others, estimating the loss to be between $30,000 and $70,000. The court thus increased Serpico's base offense level of 6 by 9 levels, plus 2 levels for more than minimal planning and 2 levels for abuse of trust (19 total). Serpico and Cataldo were sentenced to 30 and 21 months in prison, respectively.


5
Serpico and Cataldo (collectively "Serpico" as we go forward) appeal, challenging the verdicts and the application of the sentencing guidelines on a number of grounds. In its cross-appeal, the government also contests the application of the sentencing guidelines.


6
First, Serpico argues that his convictions should be overturned because his schemes did not "affect" a financial institution. The 5-year statute of limitations for mail and wire fraud offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 3282 is extended to 10 years "if the offense affects a financial institution," 18 U.S.C. § 3293(2), and Serpico could not have been prosecuted without that extension. Serpico claims that an offense only "affects a financial institution" if the offense has a direct negative impact on the institution. The district court instructed the jury that the schemes affected the banks if they "exposed the financial institution[s] to a new or increased risk of loss. A financial institution need not have actually suffered a loss in order to have been affected by the scheme."


7
Although Serpico agreed to the jury instruction, he now points to United States v. Agne, 214 F.3d 47, 53 (1st Cir.2000) and United States v. Ubakanma, 215 F.3d 421, 426 (4th Cir.2000), to support his claim that the financial institution must suffer an actual loss. In Agne, however, the court found that the bank "experienced no realistic prospect of loss," so it did not have to reach the question of whether the bank must suffer an actual loss. Agne, 214 F.3d at 53. Similarly, Ubakanma simply held that "a wire fraud offense under section 1343 `affected' a financial institution only if the institution itself were victimized by the fraud, as opposed to the scheme's mere utilization of the financial institution in the transfer of funds." Ubakanma, 215 F.3d at 426. Neither side here argues that "mere utilization" is sufficient; the question is whether an increased risk of loss is enough, even if the institution never suffers an actual loss.


8
Several courts, including this one and the Fourth Circuit, which produced Ubakanma, have concluded that an increased risk of loss is sufficient in similar contexts. See, e.g., United States v. Longfellow, 43 F.3d 318, 324 (7th Cir.1994) (quoting United States v. Hord, 6 F.3d 276, 282 (5th Cir.1993) ("risk of loss, not just loss itself, supports conviction" for bank fraud)); United States v. Colton, 231 F.3d 890, 907 (4th Cir.2000); see also Pattern Criminal Federal Jury Instructions for the Seventh Circuit (1990), p. 217 (The mail interstate carrier wire fraud statute "can be violated whether or not there is any [loss or damage to the victim of the crime] [or] [gain to the defendant].").


9
More importantly, the whole purpose of § 3293(2) is to protect financial institutions, a goal it tries to accomplish in large part by deterring would-be criminals from including financial institutions in their schemes. Just as society punishes someone who recklessly fires a gun, whether or not he hits anyone, protection for financial institutions is much more effective if there's a cost to putting those institutions at risk, whether or not there is actual harm. Accordingly, we find no error in the district court's jury instruction.


10
Serpico next argues that, even if the district court correctly interpreted § 3292(2), his schemes did not "affect" a financial institution because they did not create increased risks for the banks involved in the schemes. Essentially, Serpico claims that the banks in both schemes were willing participants who would not have chosen to participate unless it was in their best interests (that is, factoring in the risks, they expected to make money on the deals). But the mere fact that participation in a scheme is in a bank's best interest does not necessarily mean that it is not exposed to additional risks and is not "affected," as shown clearly by the various banks' dealings with Serpico.


11
For example, the hotel loan kickback scheme affected Mid-City even though Mid-City believed it would make money on the deal. Mid-City made a $6.5 million construction loan, one it obviously would not have made if it believed the risks associated with the loan outweighed the expected payoff. But the loan, as all loans do, did carry some risk. Since Mid-City did not want to be a long-term real estate lender, it agreed to the loan only after Serpico misappropriated Midwest Pension Plan ("MPP") funds in making the MPP's $6.5 million end-mortgage loan (which meant that, if all went well, Mid-City would quickly be repaid). Therefore, Mid-City never would have been exposed to the risks of its loan absent Serpico's scheme because it never would have made the loan.


12
Serpico responds that MPP's $6.5 million essentially guaranteed the loan, so there was no risk to Mid-City. But, under the terms of the loan, if the hotel was not completed on time and under budget, the money MPP put up would be returned to it. That would leave Mid-City with a risky long-term loan it didn't want. On top of that, the kickback scheme increased the chances that the project would run into trouble. Certainly a construction project is more likely to be delayed when those running it and putting up the money for it are doing so illegally, making them subject to the disruption of investigation and arrest at any time.


13
The loans-for-deposits scheme shows even more dramatically that a bank can take on higher risk while acting in what it believes to be its own best interests. Banks, including Capitol Bank (which no longer exists as a result of punishments it received after pleading guilty to conspiring with Serpico and Busillo to defraud the CSJB entities), decided the benefits from the deposits made it worth the risk of loss resulting from the generous terms and conditions of the loans it gave Serpico. But the fact remained that the bank made risky loans at low interest rates that it never would have made absent the scheme.


14
In fact, at trial, Serpico's counsel told the court that "if the defendants were convicted of a loans-for-deposits scheme, that conduct in and of itself would mean that they affected a financial institution" and "I don't know I could conceivably argue that the particular scheme did not affect a financial institution." He now tries two arguments. In addition to arguing that the bank was acting in its own best interest, Serpico claims that a financial institution is not "affected" if it is an active perpetrator in the offense. We find that argument unpersuasive. It is not supported by Ubakanma, as Serpico claims, and we find it hard to understand how a bank that was put out of business as a direct result of the scheme was not "affected," even if it played an active part in the scheme.


15
Next, Serpico argues that he was prejudiced by the admission of evidence relating to various charges on which the district court acquitted him before the case went to the jury. In United States v. Holzer, 840 F.2d 1343, 1349 (7th Cir.1988), we addressed almost this very issue:


16
When, as is often the case (it was here), the jury acquits a defendant of some counts of a multi-count indictment, the defendant is not entitled to a new trial on the counts of which he was convicted, on the theory that the conviction was tainted by evidence, which the jury heard, relating to the counts on which it acquitted.... No rule of evidence is violated by the admission of evidence concerning a crime of which the defendant is acquitted, provided the crime was properly joined to the crime for which he was convicted and the crimes did not have to be severed for purposes of trial. It makes no difference, moreover, whether the jury acquits on some counts or the trial or reviewing court sets aside the conviction.


17
Serpico notes that his case is different in that the admitted evidence here concerned claims that the court dismissed before they reached the jury. Still, the Holzer reasoning applies. No rule of evidence was violated, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to award a new trial to Serpico.


18
We also reject Serpico's claims that his conviction should be overturned or he is entitled to a new trial because there was not sufficient evidence to convict him and that the record does not permit a confident conclusion that Serpico is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Given the evidence, the jury reasonably concluded that the $333,850 payment to Cataldo was made in exchange for the loan from Serpico and that some of that $333,850 trickled down to Serpico.


19
Similarly, we reject Cataldo's claim that the district court abused its discretion in denying his severance motion. To succeed, Cataldo must show that he was "unable to obtain a fair trial, not merely that a separate trial would have offered [him] a better chance of acquittal." United States v. Bruce, 109 F.3d 323, 327 (7th Cir.1997). Cataldo claims he should have been tried separately because there was a gross disparity in the evidence presented against him and his co-defendants. But a "simple `disparity in the evidence' will not suffice to support a motion for severance," United States v. Caliendo, 910 F.2d 429, 438 (7th Cir.1990). Moreover, the trial court instructed the jury to consider the evidence against each defendant individually, and juries are presumed to be capable of following such limiting instructions. United States v. Williams, 858 F.2d 1218, 1225 (7th Cir.1988). Because there is no reason the jury here could not follow that instruction, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Cataldo's motion.


20
Finally, both Serpico and the government challenge the district court's application of the sentencing guidelines. Serpico challenges the calculation of the loss from both schemes. With regards to the hotel loan kickback scheme, Serpico claims that the union entities suffered no loss because the loan was repaid (the district court found the loss attributable to both defendants to be $333,850, the amount paid to Cataldo). But Serpico's theory fails to consider the fact that, although none of the $6.5 million was lost, more money could have been earned. Obviously, the 51 Associates partnership was willing to pay (and did pay) an extra $333,850 in order to secure the loan. That money could have gone to the union entities instead of Cataldo if Serpico had been acting in the entities' best interests instead of his own. See generally United States v. Briscoe, 65 F.3d 576, 589 (7th Cir.1995) (kickbacks "represent money that should have gone to the Union" and, as such, were properly included in the loss calculation).


21
We also reject Serpico's alternative argument that he (individually, as opposed to with Cataldo) should only be accountable for the $25,000 that Cataldo kicked back to him. Serpico and Cataldo are each accountable for "all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity." USSG § 1B1.3(a)(1)(B). Since Serpico knew money was going to be paid back to Cataldo for work he never did, the district court correctly held him responsible for the full $333,850 loss.


22
Serpico also argues that, in computing the losses from the loans-for-deposits scheme, the district court should not have included losses arising from CD purchases from banks other than Capitol because the court did not have sufficient evidence to support a conclusion that the scheme extended to those banks. But the 12-year pattern of union deposits into banks from which Serpico simultaneously sought personal loans, combined with documents from Gladstone-Norwood Bank and Exchange Bank suggesting that loans were approved in order to secure union deposits, presented sufficient evidence.


23
In its cross-appeal, the government first claims the district court applied the wrong offense guideline. The district court calculated the defendants' sentences under § 2F1.1 (the fraud guideline), but the government argues it should have applied § 2E5.1 (the benefit plan bribery guideline) during sentencing. We review the district court's selection of the applicable guideline section de novo. United States v. Dion, 32 F.3d 1147, 1148 (7th Cir.1994).


24
Clearly, the government wants it both ways; having chosen to prosecute Serpico under the mail fraud statute, it wants him sentenced based on bribery. As unjust as this practice might seem in a case like this (Serpico essentially would be sentenced for a crime, bribery, he could not have been charged with because the statute of limitations had run), the guidelines not only allow but even encourage this scheme, which someone could argue is a little like an old bait-and-switch. Under § 1B1.2(a), however, the district court is instructed to "[d]etermine the offense guideline section in Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) applicable to the offense of conviction (i.e., the offense conduct charged in the count of the indictment or information of which the defendant was convicted)." USSG § 1B1.2(a) (1990). The commentary to that section elaborates: "When a particular statute proscribes a variety of conduct that might constitute the subject of different offense guidelines, the court will determine which guideline section applies based upon the nature of the offense conduct charged in the count of which the defendant was convicted." § 1B1.2, comment. (n.1). In other words, as in United States v. Hauptman, 111 F.3d 48 (7th Cir. 1997), the sentencing judge should endeavor to locate the "essence" of the defendant's conduct, not merely the name attached to the statute violated.


25
Therefore, § 1B1.2(a) encourages the district court to find an appropriate guideline section to fit the conduct (not just the charge). Section 2F1.1 of the 1990 guidelines, under which Serpico was convicted and sentenced, notes:


26
[T]he mail or wire fraud statutes, or other relatively broad statutes, are used primarily as jurisdictional bases for the prosecution of other offenses.... Where the indictment or information setting forth the count of conviction (or a stipulation as described in § 1B1.2(a)) establishes an offense more aptly covered by another guideline, apply that guideline rather than § 2F1.1.


27
§ 2F1.1, comment. (n.13).


28
The indictment charged that Serpico "sought and received a substantial personal benefit and kickback in exchange for influencing" the MPP to provide the $6.5 million loan, which is closer to bribery than mail fraud (in § 2E5.1, a "bribe" is "the offer or acceptance of an unlawful payment with the specific understanding that it will corruptly affect an official action of the recipient." § 2E5.1, comment. (n.1)). Similarly, the loans-for-deposits scheme was basic bribery, with Serpico promising union deposits to the banks in exchange for favorable personal loans. Therefore, the district court should have sentenced Serpico and Cataldo under § 2E5.1.


29
Finally, the government argues that the district court erred by failing to consider the approximately $475,000 that Serpico derived from the loans-for-deposits scheme through his investment in Studio Network. The government argues that it showed that Serpico invested $25,000 in the partnership in 1983, then sold his share 5 years later for $500,000. The government claims that the district court should have used Serpico's gain as an alternative measure of loss under § 2F1.1 (which also would be used under § 2E5.1). See § 2F1.1, comment. (n.8) ("The offender's gain from committing the fraud is an alternative estimate that ordinarily will underestimate the loss.").


30
We have interpreted § 2F1.1 of the 1990 guidelines to require that the amount of loss be based on "the net detriment to the victim." See United States v. Mount, 966 F.2d 262, 265. Therefore, the defendant's gain should only be used when the loss to the victim cannot be reasonably estimated (as the 2001 guidelines make clear: "The court shall use the gain that resulted from the offense as an alternative measure of loss only if there is a loss but it reasonably cannot be determined."), § 2B1.1, comment. (n.2(B)). The district court reasonably estimated the loss from the loans-for-deposits to be equal to the additional amount the union entities could have earned at banks offering more favorable rates on CDs. To use the $475,000 that Serpico earned suggests that the unions would have received an astounding 1,900 percent return on their investments, a wholly unsubstantiated claim.


31
To summarize: We affirm the convictions and the loss calculations but remand for sentencing under § 2E5.1.

Margaruite J. BRANCH, Plaintiff,
v.
Robert H. FINCH, Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, Defendant.
Civ. A. No. T-4561.
United States District Court, D. Kansas.
April 22, 1970.
*338 *339 *340 Reginald LaBunker, Topeka, Kan., for plaintiff.
Robert J. Roth, U. S. Atty., Elmer Hoge, Asst. U. S. Atty., Topeka, Kan., for defendant.

MEMORANDUM OF DECISION
TEMPLAR, District Judge.
This proceeding was instituted by plaintiff against the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare as is authorized by and pursuant to Section 205(g) of the Social Security Act, 42 U. S.C. § 405(g), for the purpose of obtaining a judicial review of a final decision of the Secretary denying her application for disability insurance benefits under Sections 216(i) and 223 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. § 416(i) and 423. An affidavit being filed, this Court, on April 25. 1969, entered an order granting plaintiff leave to sue forma pauperis without securing costs.
Both parties in this action have submitted motions for summary judgment together with briefs to support their respective positions.
The plaintiff filed her application to establish a period of disability on February 28, 1968, as provided in Section 416(i), and for disability insurance benefits, as provided under Section 423 of the Act. Claimant alleged, in substance, that she became unable to work because of a badly sprained back on September 23, 1967. The application was denied initially and on reconsideration. On December 11, 1968, a hearing was conducted before the hearing examiner of the department, at which the plaintiff was present without an attorney. The hearing examiner filed his decision denying plaintiff's application on December 30, 1968. The appeals Council upheld the decision of the hearing examiner upon the plaintiff's request for review. The hearing examiner's decision became the final decision of the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare. The claimant will meet the earnings requirement until June 30, 1972.
The hearing examiner determined that, in view of the claimant's limited education and age, training for sedentary work would not be profitable for her. In his determination that the claimant is not entitled to a period of disability or to disability insurance benefits, the hearing examiner made the following findings:
"FINDINGS OF FACT
"1. The claimant is approximately 59 years of age and she has an eighth grade education.
"2. The claimant has worked as a laundry worker, waitress, maid, and nurse's aide.
"3. In September 1967 the claimant began to suffer from back pain and she was treated for the condition at St. Francis Hospital, Topeka, Kansas.
"4. Orthopedic examination of the claimant's back in May 1968 resulted in a diagnosis of mild musculoligamentous strain residuals with underlying mild lumbar degenerative joint disease.
"5. The claimant has not attempted to secure work since leaving her employment with the A. T. & S. F. Hospital, Topeka, Kansas, in 1967.
"6. While the claimant's back condition has possibly prevented her from returning to work as a maid, she has not been prevented from working as a waitress, laundry helper, or nurse's aide for a period of twelve months or more and she is currently able to engage in this type of activity.
"CONCLUSION OF LAW
"The claimant has not been prevented from engaging in substantial, gainful activity for a period of twelve months *341 or more at any time prior to the date of this decision and she is presently able to work as a waitress, laundry helper, or nurse's aide." (Record P. 9, 10).
The primary issue before this Court is whether or not there is substantial evidence to support the Secretary's decision that plaintiff was not entitled to a period of disability or to disability insurance benefits and specifically whether plaintiff has been unable to engage in substantial gainful activity by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.
The definition of disability set forth in § 423(d) (1) provides:
"(d) (1) The term `disability' means
(A) inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months * * *."
"(2) For purposes of paragraph (1) (A)
(A) an individual * * * shall be determined to be under a disability only if his physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy, regardless of whether such work exists in the immediate area in which he lives, or whether a specific job vacancy exists for him, or whether he would be hired if he applied for work. * * *"
*   *   *   *   *   *
"(3) For purposes of this subsection, a `physical or mental impairment' is an impairment that results from anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities which are demonstrable by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques."
*   *   *   *   *   *
"(5) An individual shall not be considered to be under a disability unless he furnishes such medical and other evidence of the existence thereof as the Secretary may require."
The word "any" as used in the phrase "any substantial gainful activity" must be read in light of what is reasonable and not what is merely conceivable. See Huneycutt v. Gardner, 282 F.Supp. 405 (M.D.N.C.1968).
This Court recognizes that judicial review of final decisions of the Secretary is a defined and limited one. See Folsom v. O'Neal, 250 F.2d 946 (10th Cir. 1957); Gordon v. Celebrezze, 253 F.Supp. 779 (D.Kan.1965); Jones v. Celebrezze, 246 F.Supp. 701 (D.Kan. 1965); and Shonk v. Gardner (Templar, J., No. T-4354, unreported). The Court pointed out in Gardner v. Bishop, 362 F.2d 917, 919 (10th Cir. 1966), that findings of fact by the Secretary and the inferences drawn from such findings should not be disturbed by a reviewing court, "if there is substantial evidence to support them. Substantial evidence has been defined as `such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.'" Stated in a different manner the evidence must be such, if the trial were to a jury, as would justify a refusal to direct a verdict when the conclusion sought to be drawn from it is one of fact for the jury. If there is only a slight preponderance of the evidence on one side or the other, the Secretary's finding should be affirmed. See Underwood v. Ribicoff, 298 F.2d 850, 851 (4th Cir. 1962).
This Court is aware of the principle that the Act should be construed liberally in favor of a party seeking its benefits. See Davidson v. Gardner, *342 370 F.2d 803 (6th Cir. 1966); Dvorak v. Celebrezze, 345 F.2d 894 (10th Cir. 1965); and Ketcherside v. Celebrezze, 209 F.Supp. 226 (D.Kan.1962). It is clear that a court is not to try a case de novo and that it must not abdicate its traditional function to scrutinize the entire record in order to determine whether the conclusions made by the Secretary are rational and if the court should determine that reliance has been placed upon one portion of the record in disregard of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, then the court is bound to modify or reverse the Secretary's findings with or without remanding the case for rehearing. See Thomas v. Celebrezze, 331 F.2d 541 (4th Cir. 1964) and Burrell v. Finch, 308 F.Supp. 264 (D. Kan.1969). The plaintiff's age, education, training, experience, and physical and mental capabilities are of considerable importance in determining her rights to disability benefits under the Act. See Ellerman v. Flemming, 188 F.Supp. 521 (D.Mo.1960) and Aniol v. Flemming, 188 F.Supp. 233 (D.Kan.1960).
The record discloses that claimant resides at 627 W. 17th Topeka, Kansas, has a seventh grade education, and was approximately 59 years of age at the time of the hearing. There is some discrepancy as to the level of education attained by the claimant. Although the hearing examiner found that the claimant had an eighth grade education, the claimant testified that she had finished the seventh grade. In her request for reconsideration (Record P. 67) the claimant stated that she had only an eighth grade education, and Dr. Miller made reference to the eighth grade in one of his reports (Record P. 51). The claimant testified that she is married, but separated, and has eight children living. (Record P. 21). The claimant's past work record may be summarized as follows: waitress for a number of years; nurse's aide; worked for a laundry as an ironer; and worked as a maid at the Santa Fe Hospital, which was her most recent employment. Additional testimony offered by the claimant may be summarized as follows:
The claimant does not have a driver's license or a car, but she is able to use the public buses. She testified that she is 5' 3" and weighs 139 lbs., although she used to weigh 165 lbs. The claimant stated that she weighed 165 when she got hurt, then in response to a question of the hearing examiner she stated that she weighed up in the 40's in September 1967. She worked for Santa Fe Hospital for 3 years as a maid, and the work involved scrubbing, dusting, washing windows and waxing.
The claimant testified that while she was scrubbing the floor, the bed broke and she slipped. She stated that she went to St. Francis Hospital and was there for 12 days. She further stated that she had doctored with Dr. Rook and took treatments at the Santa Fe Hospital before she had to quit at Santa Fe. She said that she felt better for a while after being released. She testified that she received a workmen's compensation settlement.
The claimant said that she did not look for any work after the injury occurred because she is not able to work. In relation to her back she stated that whenever she does a lot of stooping, scrubbing or anything like that, or standing on her feet any length or period of time it bothers her. She has not had any surgery on her back but the doctor said she might have to, although he did not advise it now. She testified that she stays home and watches television, and that she is able to make her meals and take care of her personal needs. She cannot do any mopping, ironing, scrubbing, washing, lifting or anything like that because it bothers her. She does not wear a back brace, and the doctor has not suggested that she should. She takes the medicine the doctor gives her and heat treatments. The heat treatments consist of heating towels *343 in hot water and putting them on a heat pad. In regard to house cleaning the claimant dusts and things like that. She visits her daughters and she has company once in a while.
The claimant's support consists of $83 a month from welfare. In reference to a question about attempting to find work as a waitress she stated that she did not think she could stand up on her feet that long. She testified that steady walking bothers her, and she does not think she could stand up as a waitress carrying heavy trays and plates. She indicated that she likes to work and wishes she could. She stated that her back feels worse when she gets up and around during the day and when she turns over at night it bothers her, but the heat treatments help a lot. The doctor has not suggested that she should exercise for the back condition, but said she could not do any heavy work. She indicated that her back feels worse when she goes to bed than when she gets up.
Two of the claimant's daughters testified that they clean house for her. They do the scrubbing, ironing, washing and waxing. One of the daughters testified that in her opinion her mother's back condition would keep her from working as a maid.
In the claimant's hospital admission report dated October 1, 1967, Dr. Kirk Miller, M.D., claimant's personal physician, stated the admission diagnosis as "Low back syndrome" and "Constipation". (Record P. 45) In this report Dr. Miller noted the claimant's chief complaint was low back pain and he gave the following summary of claimant's illness:
"About two weeks ago, while mopping at Santa Fe Hospital, patient noted gradual onset of low back pain. It became so severe that it was finally necessary for her to quit work. I have been seeing her in my office during the past week at which time she was put on muscle relaxants and diathermy, but all to no avail. She still continued to have her pain. It was decided to put her in the hospital where we could obtain some studies, possibly a myelogram; in any event, to treat her more intensively with heat and bed-rest and traction." (Record P. 45)
The doctor made the following physical examination findings in this same report:
"Well developed, well nourished, 57-year old female appearing younger than stated age, not appearing acutely or chronically ill. HEENT * * * Pupils round, regular, equal, react well to light and on accomodation. Ear canals and drums clear. Pharynx clear. Neck supple; no thyroid enlargement. Chest clear to percussion and auscultation. Heart reveals regular sinus rhythm; no murmurs or enlargement. Abdomen soft; no masses, spasms, tenderness; LKSB not felt. Extremities relatively unremarkable. There is considerable tenderness to deep palpation over the lower lumbar spine and just lateral to the lower lumbar spine around L-4, L-5 bilaterally." (Record P. 45)
In the hospital discharge report dated October 12, 1967, Dr. Miller noted:
"Patient was admitted with a 2-weeks history of low back pain; she has had one previous episode. Admitted for conservative treatment of back condition and possible myelogram if she did not clear. Px revealed considerable tenderness to palpation over the lower lumbar spine and just lateral to the lower lumbar spine around L-4, L-5, bilaterally. WBC revealed slight shift to the left, which was normal with 70 polys, 22 lymphs. IVP negative. Quantitative urine for culture was negative. Chest film normal. Spine films revealed degeneration and/or herniation of the L-4, L-5 disc.
"Patient was placed in bed and given a Kapok pad warm heat treatment to her lower back. She was given Ultrasound daily to lower back by the physiotherapy department, placed on Darvon-65 *344 p. r. n. pain. Over a period of a week back pain gradually disappeared. During this period of time she also noted frequent urination and nocturia 3-4m. Urinary studies were carried out which were negative. She recovered completely from back pain after 12 days in the hospital and she is being sent home today taking no medication except Darvon p. r. n. She will continue her Parafon Forte, if necessary. It is decided that she can return to work if her back pain disappears. Her work seems to aggravate her condition and it may be necessary for her to find some other profession because of this difficulty." (Record P. 47)
Dr. Miller indicated his final diagnosis in the hospital discharge report as:
"Degeneration and/or herniation of L-4, L-5 disc
Frequent urination, cause undetermined" (Record P. 57)
In another report dated March 20, 1968, Dr. Miller stated his diagnosis as "Low back syndrome with probable herniation of L-4 to L-5 disk." (Record P. 51) The following history of the patient was given by Dr. Miller in this report:
"This patient originally injured her back while working for the Santa Fe Hospital in the Winter of 1966-1967. At that time her anterior thigh muscles hurt while mopping, and she was off of work for 10 days. Again on September 11, 1967 while scrubbing a floor, her back began to hurt and has been hurting ever since. She was put on Parafon Forte, given diathermy treatment, a bed-board was suggested for her, and she had to use moist heat at home, and treatment continued from September 25th until October 1st, 1967 without much relief. She was hospitalized at St. Francis Hospital from October 1 to October 12, 1967, and her back was considerably improved. When seen on October 23, 1967, it was felt she could return to work and do light work. At that time she was given Darvon Compound and feeling much better. She was seen again in November and December of 1967, and January and February of 1968, at monthly intervals, at such time she stated that she had some soreness occasionally. Straight legraising was O.K. bilaterally except for slight soreness on the left when elevated to 90 degrees. It was felt that she would be able to continue to work in a sedentary type job but she should never again do heavy lifting or mopping such as she had done previously." (Record P. 48)
Dr. Miller further noted in this same report that "Because of this patient's limited educational background (8th grade) it will probably be difficult for her to obtain sedentary type of occupation which will be required for her with her difficulty." (Record P. 51)
In a report dated May 13, 1968, Dr. W. L. Beller, a radiologist, to whom the claimant had been referred by Dr. Donald D. Hobbs, stated as his conclusion the following:
"Moderate degenerative disc disease at the L4 level. Mild rotoscoliosis of the dorsolumbar spine. No other significant abnormality is apparent." (Record P. 58)
Dr. Donald D. Hobbs, specialist in orthopedic surgery, submitted a report dated May 27, 1968, in which he noted that the claimant complained of persistent low back pain with aching discomfort aggravated by bending and stooping. In this report Dr. Hobbs made the following findings upon examination of the claimant:
"Examination today reveals an alert, co-operative woman in no apparent distress. She moves about the examining room with normal gait. Does heel and toe walking without evidence of muscle weakness. There is no significant evidence of guarding on performance of trunk motions. Range of motion of the lumbar spine in flexion, extension and lateral flexion is essentially normal. The patient complains of increased discomfort on left lateral *345 flexion and on hyperextension. There is mild tenderness over the paravetebral musculature on the left with deep palpation. No significant gluteal sciatic notch tenderness. The patient complains of pain on any attempted mobilization of the left lower extremity, hip-knee flexion, straight leg raising or simple rotary motions of the hip joint. Certainly there is no appreciable limitation of straight leg raising and Laseque's test is negative. Domarque, Trendelenburg, Ober and Ely tests are all negative. The neurologic check including motor, sensory and reflex activity over the segmental distribution of the lumbosacral plexus is entirely physiologic. Babinski's sign is bilaterally absent. The popliteal stretch test is entirely negative." (Record P. 61)
Dr. Hobbs stated his impression as "Mild musculo-ligamentous strain residuals with underlying mild lumbar degenerative joint disease" and he concluded his report by saying "It is my impression that this patient is a suitable candidate for moderate work activity perhaps to exclude excessive bending, stooping and heavy lifting."
Dr. Miller submitted a supplemental report dated August 16, 1968, in which his diagnosis was:
"1. Low back syndrome, probable herniation of L-4 to L-5 disc.
2. Chronic rhinitis." (Record P. 72)
Dr. Miller further stated in this report:
"I saw the patient on March 25, 1968, at which time she had subsequently had a mild urinary tract infection prior to this time which was cleared up. She was having difficulty with leg cramps. A calcium and phosperous determination were obtained and found to be within normal limits. The patient stated that her back was well at that time. I saw the patient again on April 19, 1968 at which time her back was bothering her off and on but not as sore as usual. She had an acute bronchitis for which she was treated with expectorants, decongestants and given a course of inhalation therapy. She continued this until April 27, 1968, at which time was quite recovered from the infection.
I did not see the patient again until August 10, 1968, at which time she stated that she was still having some back trouble. She reported that she had stooped over one time last week and her back hurt her for only one day. She also stated that it hurt her to do any scrubbing or any physical work. She also had a chronic rhinitis. For the rhinitis I gave her some decongestants and sprays. She stated that she was taking Darvon Compound 65 PRN for her back difficulty." (Record P. 69)
The hearing examiner noted that the claimant "seemed somewhat younger than her stated age of 59, and about her stated height and weight of 5 feet 3 inches and 139 pounds, respectively." (Record P. 8) He also stated that the claimant "exhibited no significant signs or symptoms of any mental or physical impairments during the hearing." (Record P. 8)
In the disability interview report the interviewer indicated that claimant displayed no difficulty with walking, speaking, sight, hearing, use of hands and arms, breathing, sitting, reading, writing, responding, language, or comprehending. (Record P. 55)
The finding of disability in a social security disability case involves a two-step finding. First, there must be a finding that the claimant has a medically determinable physical or mental impairment. Second, assuming such impairment is found to be present, there must be a finding of whether the impairment, in fact, causes an inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity. See Knelly v. Celebrezze, 249 F. Supp. 521 (M.D.Pa.1965), and Burrell v. Finch, 308 F.Supp. 264 (D.Kan.1969). The first finding may require the application of objective and subjective evidence and the second is almost an entirely *346 subjective determination. See Mauldin v. Celebrezze, 260 F.Supp. 287 (D.S. C.1966). Certain elements of proof should be considered in making a finding of claimant's ability or inability to engage in any substantial gainful employment, and they are: objective medical facts and clinical findings; diagnoses and expert medical opinions of treating and examining physicians; subjective evidence of pain and disability testified to by claimant and other lay witnesses; and the educational background, work history and present age of claimant. See Morgan v. Gardner, D.C., 254 F. Supp. 977, and Huneycutt v. Gardner, supra.
As the defendant stated in his brief there is no question whether plaintiff has a back impairment and back pain because all the medical evidence indicates that she does. The defendant also correctly stated that the key question is whether that impairment and the attending pain are so severe that plaintiff is unable to engage in substantial gainful activity. (Defendant's Brief P. 5) The first portion of the two-step test has been met in that the plaintiff has a medically determinable impairment. The second part of the test as to whether that impairment and accompanying pain are so severe that the claimant is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity is mainly a subjective determination. This Court is well aware of the fact that pain can be so severe as to be disabling in itself, with or without objective symptoms. See Bailey v. Cohen, (Templar, J., No. T-4266, unreported). The test is not whether the impairment, subjective or objective, would be disabling to a theoretical person but instead whether the subjective complaint independently or together with other impairments is disabling to this particular claimant. See Shonk v. Gardner, (Templar, J., No. T-4354, unreported); Burrell v. Cohen, supra; and Franklin v. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, 393 F.2d 640 (2d Cir. 1968). Subjective symptoms should be evaluated with due consideration for credibility, motivation, and medical evidence of impairment. See Dvorak v. Celebrezze, supra. The burden of proving disability under the Social Security Act is with the claimant, See McMillin v. Gardner, 384 F.2d 596 (10th Cir. 1967), and this burden need not be carried beyond a reasonable doubt. See Rose v. Finch, 303 F.Supp. 35 (W.D.Va.1969).
In the present case the plaintiff testified before the hearing examiner that she could perform certain household chores and that she could take care of her personal needs. A claimant need not be completely helpless, bedfast or at death's door in order to sustain her claim for disability benefits. See Perkins v. Ribicoff, 201 F.Supp. 332 (E.D.Ark.1961). The ability to do light housework does not constitute a true test of ability to engage in substantial gainful activity. See Murphy v. Gardner, 379 F.2d 1 (8th Cir. 1967); Jarvis v. Ribicoff, 312 F.2d 707 (6th Cir. 1963); and Mims v. Celebrezze, 217 F. Supp. 581 (D.Colo.1963).
The plaintiff in this case does have an impairment, a back condition, and there is testimony and evidence that she suffers some pain. The hearing examiner determined that the plaintiff could work as a waitress, laundry helper, or nurse's aide, occupations in which she had formerly engaged in. The Secretary does not have the duty of finding a specific employer for a specific job. See Gardner v. Brian, 369 F.2d 443 (10th Cir. 1966). In Statzer v. Cohen, 297 F.Supp. 874, 877 (W.D.Va.1969) the Court stated:
"The question here is not whether the claimant would be hired by an employer if he applied for work, but rather, whether he is physically and mentally capable of performing work which exists in significant numbers in the national economy."
Two of the examining physicians found, in effect, that the plaintiff could return to some type of work, either sedentary *347 or moderate, although not to her former employment. Dr. Miller noted in one of his reports that "Because of this patient's limited educational background (8th grade) it will probably be difficult for her to obtain sedentary type of occupation which will be required for her with her difficulty." (Record P. 51) This last notation is only an opinion of Dr. Miller, and this determination is for the Secretary to make after a review of all the proceedings in the case. The type of substantial gainful activity that a disability claimant can be found able to engage in must be both substantial and gainful, realistically judged by his education, training and experience. See Jones v. Gardner, 282 F.Supp. 56 (W.D. Ark.1966), and Nichols v. Gardner, 361 F.2d 963 (8th Cir. 1966). The fact that a claimant for disability benefits could not work without pain or discomfort does not satisfy the test for disability under the act. See Coomes v. Ribicoff, 209 F.Supp. 670 (D.Kan.1962). It must be remembered that the Social Security Act is not to be interpreted as unemployment compensation insurance. See Celebrezze v. Sutton, 338 F.2d 417 (8th Cir. 1964), and Richard v. Celebrezze, 247 F.Supp. 183 (D.Minn.1965).
The plaintiff's attorney stated in his brief:
"The problem in plaintiff's case is not whether there is waitress, laundry helper, or nurses aide work available, and whether she would be hired if she applied for those jobs that the hearing examiner determined that plaintiff could do, but rather whether under the medical evidence and plaintiff's own testimony she could perform those occupations on a `sustained basis' to the extent that she could have been `substantially gainfully employed' during the past two years." (Brief P. 8)
The finding of the hearing examiner that the claimant is able to work as a waitress, laundry helper or nurse's aide is not entirely supported by the objective and subjective factors considered in this case. Employment as a waitress could not be considered in any sense of the imagination as "sedentary" or "moderate" work activity. The plaintiff testified that she worked as an ironer for the American Linen Company for about eight months, but she left this employment when the company closed down. It is to be noted in this case that the plaintiff has made no effort to seek substantial gainful employment of any type. There is evidence that the plaintiff has a back impairment with accompanying pain; there is evidence that the plaintiff should not return to her former work as a maid at the Santa Fe Hospital; and there is evidence that the plaintiff is able to perform some type of work. The only evidence contrary to the plaintiff's ability to work is the plaintiff's belief that she cannot work. In the case of Carden v. Gardner, 352 F.2d 51, 52 (6th Cir. 1965) the Court stated:
"* * * it is also the rule that where the Secretary has found from the evidence that the claimant is able to engage in a former trade or occupation, such a determination `precludes the necessity of an administrative showing of gainful work which the appellant was capable of doing and the availability of any such work.'"
After considering the objective and subjective factors in this case the Court concludes that plaintiff is able to work as a nurse's aide and may be able to work as a laundry helper, occupations in which she was once engaged.
There is evidence and testimony in this case that the plaintiff received a small, lump sum workmen's compensation settlement. A determination of disability by a state or some other agency is not binding on the Secretary in a social security disability benefits case. See Neel v. Ribicoff, 204 F. Supp. 914 (D.Or.1962); Dupkunis v. Celebrezze, 323 F.2d 380 (3rd Cir. 1963); Sampson v. Flemming, 189 F.Supp. 725 (D.Kan.1960); and Stancavage v. Celebrezze, 209 F.Supp. 781, reversed on other grounds 323 F.2d 373 (3rd Cir. 1963).
*348 The plaintiff's attorney makes reference in his brief to the fact that the claimant was without representation of counsel during the proceedings. In Hullom v. Burrows, 266 F.2d 547, 548 (6th Cir. 1959), cert. den. 361 U.S. 919, 80 S.Ct. 262, 4 L.Ed.2d 187, it was said:
"The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which provides that in criminal prosecutions the accused shall have the assistance of counsel for his defense, does not apply to civil cases."
In his decision the hearing examiner stated that "* * * claimant did not have a representative, but was fully advised by the Hearing Examiner of her right to be represented, which right was waived by the claimant." (Record P. 5) There is no evidence in the record that the hearing examiner made any inquiry regarding claimant's representation at the hearing. Apparently the claimant did receive a notice of hearing which included information concerning representation, which read in part, "While it is not required, you may be represented at the hearing by an attorney or other qualified person of your choice, if you desire assistance in presenting your case." (Record P. 14) It then discussed the payment of a fee to the attorney or other representative. A claimant's lack of counsel in a social security disability benefits case does not require reversal of a decision denying benefits if the claimant had a fair opportunity to be heard, full opportunity to present evidence, and was not prejudiced by the absence of counsel. See Meola v. Ribicoff, 207 F.Supp. 658 (S.D.N.Y.1962). It is worthy of note in this case that the plaintiff was represented by an attorney in her workmen's compensation claim, which occurred prior to the proceedings in this case, and two letters from the plaintiff's attorney relating to the workmen's compensation claim were submitted at the hearing. The plaintiff's attorney in her workmen's compensation claim is the same attorney now representing the plaintiff on this review. The plaintiff was given a full and fair hearing before the hearing examiner even though she was not represented by counsel.
Plaintiff's attorney stated in his brief at page 3 that plaintiff weighed 165 pounds when hurt and she weighed 139 pounds at the time of the hearing. This statement is not supported by the evidence and testimony in the case. The plaintiff testified that she weighed 165 pounds until she was hurt, but in response to a question of the hearing examiner as to whether she weighed 165 pounds in September 1967 she stated that she weighed in the 40's then. (Record P. 21, 22) In the hospital admission report, Dr. Miller noted in his systemic review that claimant had lost 10 pounds in the last year. (Record P. 45) There is no evidence or testimony in this case that the plaintiff suffered a substantial loss of weight because of her injury or that any weight loss contributed adversely to her condition.
Plaintiff's counsel cited two Kansas workmen's compensation cases, Hanna v. Edward Gray Corp., 197 Kan. 793, 421 P.2d 205, and Miller v. Beech Aircraft Corp., 204 Kan. 184, 460 P.2d 535, in support of the proposition that the testimony of the plaintiff as to the duration of disability is to be considered as well as medical testimony. Although these two state cases involved workmen's compensation, the proposition is one which would be considered by the Secretary in reaching his decision in a social security disability benefits case. It was not overlooked in the present case.
The Secretary's determination is final if supported by substantial evidence. Any conflicts in the evidence or in reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom is for the Secretary and not for the Court to resolve. Even if there is only a slight preponderance of evidence on one side or the other the Secretary's findings must be affirmed. See Ferrell v. Gardner, 260 F.Supp. 996 (S. D.W.Va.1966). This Court has carefully examined the record and briefs submitted in this case and concludes that the *349 findings of the Secretary are supported by substantial evidence except for the finding that the plaintiff could work as a waitress. This Court is convinced that the record fails to disclose that the plaintiff's impairment is of sufficient severity as to be disabling within the meaning of the Social Security Act.
For the above reasons, the Court must conclude that the decision of the Secretary be affirmed, the motion of the defendant for summary judgment is granted, and the complaint be dismissed.
It is so ordered.

638 So.2d 176 (1994)
Vickie BROADWAY and Husband Michael E. Broadway, Appellants,
v.
BAY HOSPITAL, INC., d/b/a HCA Gulf Coast Hospital, Appellee.
No. 92-2337.
District Court of Appeal of Florida, First District.
June 14, 1994.
Edmund D. Quintana of Burke & Blue, P.A., Panama City, for appellants.
Ann J. Tipton of Baker, Duke & Tipton, P.A., Pensacola, for appellee.
*177 PER CURIAM.
This cause is before us on appeal from a final order dismissing appellants' second amended complaint with prejudice. Appellants contend (1) that the trial court erred in finding that they were required to comply with the presuit screening requirements of chapter 766, Florida Statutes, for medical malpractice claims; (2) that their compliance with the presuit screening requirements was sufficient such that the trial court erred in dismissing their complaint; and (3) that section 766.203(2), Florida Statutes, which imposes as a condition precedent to the filing of a medical malpractice claim that the plaintiff provide notice of the claim and a corroborating expert opinion, is unconstitutional. We reverse as to the first issue and, consequently, do not reach the second and third issues.
The second amended complaint alleged that plaintiff/appellant Vickie Broadway was a patient at appellee's hospital in July 1989 and was injured when her hospital bed collapsed. Appellants sought damages based on appellee's breach of its duty to use reasonable care in maintaining its premises and breach of its duty to warn Ms. Broadway of latent hazards. Appellee sought dismissal of the complaint on the ground that the complaint stated a claim for medical negligence and that appellants had failed to comply with the presuit screening requirements of chapter 766, Florida Statutes. The trial court entered an order dismissing the complaint with prejudice under section 766.206(2), Florida Statutes, which requires that a medical malpractice complaint be dismissed if the court finds that the plaintiff is not in compliance with the presuit investigation requirements of chapter 766.
Under section 766.106(1)(a), Florida Statutes, "claim for medical malpractice" is defined as "a claim arising out of the rendering of, or the failure to render, medical care or services." A person seeking recovery for injury resulting from medical malpractice must prove that the injury resulted from a breach of the prevailing professional standard of care as set forth in section 766.102(1), Florida Statutes. The test for determining whether a defendant is entitled to the benefit of the presuit screening requirements of section 766.106, Florida Statutes, is whether the defendant is directly or vicariously liable under the medical negligence standard of care set forth in section 766.102(1), Florida Statutes. Weinstock v. Groth, 629 So.2d 835 (Fla. 1993), citing NME Properties, Inc. McCullough, 590 So.2d 439 (Fla. 2d DCA 1991). Not every wrongful act by a health care provider amounts to medical malpractice. Stackhouse v. Emerson, 611 So.2d 1365 (Fla. 5th DCA 1993).
From the face of the complaint, it is apparent that appellants have sued appellee for the failure to warn of a dangerous condition or properly maintain a piece of equipment, rather than for breach of some professional standard of care. We hold that the trial court erred in dismissing the complaint. We reject appellee's contention that Neilinger v. Baptist Hospital of Miami, Inc., 460 So.2d 564 (Fla. 3d DCA 1984), requires affirmance of the order below. In Neilinger, the complaint alleged that the plaintiff, a maternity patient, slipped and fell on a pool of amniotic fluid while descending from an examination table under the direction and care of employees of the hospital. The complaint on its face alleged breach of a professional standard of care.
The order appealed from is therefore reversed, and this cause is remanded for proceedings consistent herewith.
BOOTH, JOANOS and MINER, JJ., concur.

640 S.W.2d 758 (1982)
Harmon HOOT, Relator,
v.
Edwin E. BREWER, County Judge, Respondent.
No. 01-82-0583-CV.
Court of Appeals of Texas, Houston (1st Dist.).
September 3, 1982.
*759 Frank L. Mauro, Wommack, Denman & Mauro, Lake Jackson, for relator.
Charles Stevenson, Asst. Dist. Atty., Angleton, for respondent.

OPINION
DUGGAN, Justice.
This is an original mandamus proceeding in this court wherein relator seeks a writ of mandamus to compel the respondent, who is the County Judge of Brazoria County, Texas, to certify to the County Clerk of Brazoria County, Texas, relator's name to be put on the general election ballot in November, 1982, as a candidate for the office of County Judge.
The jurisdiction of this court has been invoked pursuant to Tex.Elec.Code Ann. art. 13.41 (Vernon Supp.1982) and Tex.Rev. *760 Civ.Stat.Ann. arts. 1735a and 1823. The jurisdictional requirements have been demonstrated.
Relator's position may be summarized briefly as follows: He maintains that he has met the statutory requirements for having his name printed on the official ballot for the general election in November, 1982, in the column for independent candidates. He maintains further that he has complied with Tex.Elec.Code Ann. art. 13.50 (Vernon Supp.1982) by a) providing the County Judge with his Notice of Intent to Run as an Independent Candidate within the time frame allowed under Tex.Elec.Code Ann. art. 13.12 (Vernon Supp.1982), and b) providing a written application signed by 686 eligible Brazoria County voters who had not voted in the May 1, 1982 primary election. Relator asserts further that his application exceeded the statutory requirement of 500 eligible voters by 186 signatures, and that each step was performed within the statutory time periods. No primary run-off election for the position of County Judge was required.
Relator asserts further that he has communicated with respondent on five separate occasions between July 12, 1982 and date of filing of his application for writ of mandamus with no response out of respondent as to why relator's name has not been certified. In this connection he says further that unless respondent puts relator's name on the ballot on or before September 18, 1982, relator may lose his right to run. According to the provisions of Tex.Elec. Code Ann. art. 13.56(f) (Vernon Supp.1982) if relator is declared ineligible before the 44th day before election day (November 2, 1982), his name may not be placed on the ballot. Finally, relator asserts that in the event that respondent decides on the eve of the 44th day prior to election day that relator's application does not meet the statutory requirements for gaining a place on the ballot, there will be no time for relator to obtain a judicial determination of his right to have his name on the ballot. Regarding the likelihood that this situation could occur, relator points to the fact that, if his name is on the ballot in November, he will be an opponent of the respondent for the very position which respondent now holds.
In response to all of the foregoing respondent's stance may be summarized briefly as follows:
Before a writ of mandamus will issue, relator must have a clear legal right to performance of the act he seeks to compel. The duty of the officer sought to be compelled must be one clearly fixed and required by the law, or the writ will not issue.
Further, says respondent, the Court of Appeals has no authority to issue writs of mandamus unless the facts are established without dispute.
Provisions of the Election Code concerning the contents of an independent candidate's application to be placed on the ballot at a general election are mandatory, and must be strictly complied with.
Tex.Elec.Code Ann. art. 13.50, (Vernon Supp.1982) contains the following provisions concerning the requisites of an application of an independent candidate to be placed on the ballot:
Subdivision 4. No application shall contain the name of more than one candidate for the same office; and if any person signs the application of more than one candidate for the same office, the signature shall be void as to all such applications. No person shall sign such application unless he is a qualified voter, and no person who has voted at either the general primary election or the run-off primary election of any party shall sign an application in favor of anyone for an office for which a nomination was made at either such primary election. An application may not be circulated for signatures until the day after the general primary election day, or if a runoff primary election is held for the office sought by the applicant, until the day after the runoff primary election day. A signature obtained before the day an application may be circulated is void.
Subdivision 5. In addition to the person's signature, the application shall show each *761 signer's address, the number of his voter registration certificate, and the date of signing.
Respondent contends further that the names of those persons who signed relator's application prior to the date of the primary runoff election are not valid and may not be counted. Respondent's key position in challenging the sufficiency of the application's conformity with the requirements of the Election Code is that such requirements are mandatory, that relator must strictly comply, and that the applications must contain a sufficient address. Respondent asserts that 133 of the signatures are invalid because they were obtained before June 6, 1982; further, that 221 more of the signatures are invalid because of incomplete address. Quite obviously, says respondent, the applications contained only 268 valid signatures, far short of the required 500 valid signatures.
Coming to grips now with the crucial points raised in this original proceeding this court compliments counsel for both parties on their able briefs. We recognize first, as respondent urges, that before a writ of mandamus will issue, relator must have a clear legal right to performance of the act he seeks to compel; further, that the duty of the officer sought to be compelled must be one clearly fixed and required by the law, or the writ will not issue. Oney v. Ammerman, 458 S.W.2d 54 (Tex. 1970); Bozarth v. City of Denison, 559 S.W.2d 378 (Tex.Civ.App.Dallas 1977, no writ); Blanchard v. Fulbright, 633 S.W.2d 617 (Tex.App.Houston [14th Dist.] 1982, no writ). In addition, the authorities are clear that the Courts of Appeals have no authority to issue writs of mandamus unless the facts are established without dispute. Bozarth, supra; Bigham v. Sutton, 565 S.W.2d 561 (Tex.Civ.App.Austin 1978, no writ); Donald v. Carr, 407 S.W.2d 288 (Tex. Civ.App.Dallas 1966, no writ). We are mindful also that, whereas provisions of election laws relating to voters are to be construed as directory, the provisions of election laws governing the requirements of candidates are mandatory. McWaters v. Tucker, 249 S.W.2d 80 (Tex.Civ.App.Galveston 1952, no writ); Geiger v. DeBusk, 534 S.W.2d 437 (Tex.Civ.App.Dallas 1976, no writ); Shields v. Upham, 597 S.W.2d 502 (Tex.Civ.App.El Paso 1980, no writ).

VALIDITY OF SIGNATURE DATES BEFORE JUNE 6, 1982
By respondent's own figures, there were 133 signatures falling into this category. No fact issue whatever is involved in reaching that determination. In concluding whether the signatures on relator's application should be counted if the signature date is prior to June 6, 1982, the date of the run-off election, but after the date of the general primary, Tex.Elec.Code Ann. art. 13.50 (Vernon Supp.1982) is determinative. We quote therefrom as follows:
An Application may not be circulated for signatures until the day after the general primary election day or if a run-off primary election is held for the office sought by applicant, until the day after the runoff primary election day. (Emphasis added.)
The emphasized language is the heart of the matter because it is uncontroverted that there was no runoff election for the office of County Judge of Brazoria County in 1982. We hold, therefore, that the questioned 133 signatures obtained before June 6, 1982 are valid and should be added to the 268 signatures recognized as valid by respondent.
In so holding we not only follow the clear wording of the statute, but we have the benefit of Tex.Atty.Gen.Op. No. DAD-49 (1982) which states the question as follows at page 1.
1. Under Subdivision 4 of Article 13.50, is it permissible to have an application to run as an independent candidate that contains signatures dated before the runoff primary election if there is no primary runoff election for the particular office for which a person desires, to run as an independent candidate.
At page 2 the answer to such question is given as follows:
"1. V.A.T.S. Election Code, art. 13.50, subd. 4, states, in part:

*762 An application may not be circulated for signatures until the day after the general primary election day, or if a runoff election is held for the office sought by the applicant, until the day after the runoff primary election day. A signature obtained before the day an application may be circulated is void.
Therefore, the answer to your first question is yes. Of course, no signatures could be counted if they were dated before the day after the general primary election.

SUFFICIENCY OF ADDRESS
Respondent approaches this matter by saying that the question raised is whether or not an address is sufficient if it fails to include the city in which it is located. Going further, he asserts that there are 221 insufficient addresses which fall into two categories: (1) no address listed, (2) no city listed. He says that those signatures with no address listed at all are clearly insufficient and with this we agree. But he does not say in his brief how many of these signatures there are so we must turn to his verified exhibit C attached to his original answer to petition for writ of mandamus. Exhibit C is Mike Sandel's letter to respondent dated July 8, 1982 wherein Sandel, as Director of the Data Processing Department of Brazoria County, summarized the errors found in relator's application. In the category of "Incomplete Address" he lists 221 signatures. Thus, to determine how many signatures are incomplete because no address is listed, one must look to relator's application, also attached to respondent's verified answer. When this is done, it is apparent that no more than five or six such signatures are involved. These are found at pages 7, 15, 46, 47 and 55 of relator's application. On the assumption most favorable to respondent, there are six such signatures with no address whatever shown. This then leaves 215 signatures which provide the crucial issue before this court. Is an address which fails to include the city in which it is found sufficient or insufficient as a matter of law?
Subdivision 5 of article 13.50 requires that in addition to a signature:
... the Application shall show each signer's address, the number of his voter registration certificate and the date of signing.
Relator urges that the quoted language is broad and does not require specificity in the address provided by a voter who signs an independent candidate's application. Respondent candidly admits that counsel has been unable to find a single case dealing with the meaning of "address" as it appears in Tex.Elec.Code Ann. art. 13.50, subd. 5, (Vernon Supp.1982). Relator cites Tyler v. Cook, 573 S.W.2d 567 (Tex. Civ.App.San Antonio 1978), rev'd on other grounds, 576 S.W.2d 769 (Tex.1978). In Tyler, party candidates for various county offices sought by mandamus to prevent the printing of the names of three independent candidates upon the official general election ballot. The addresses on the independent candidates' applications were challenged because they did not contain street addresses or rural route addresses. By reviewing the 1978 Voter's Registration List for the County involved, the San Antonio Court of Civil Appeals observed that the addresses for the signers of the applications shown on the Voter's Registration List were the same as the addresses the members of the Court noted on the applications of the independent candidates.
Respondent, in turn, cites and discusses numerous cases wherein the address requirements under another statute, article 13.08(d), have been construed. He points out that all such cases have held that the recital in a nominating petition of the street address of a signator, without specifying the city in which the street was located, is insufficient as a matter of law. Shields v. Upham, supra; Pierce v. Peters, 599 S.W.2d 849 (Tex.Civ.App.San Antonio 1980, no writ); Gray v. Vance, 567 S.W.2d 16 (Tex. Civ.App.Dallas 1978, no writ).
We hold that there are an additional 215 valid signatures on relator's application where such signatures have given street address, P.O. box number or rural route *763 number but have not designated the city or town. In reaching this conclusion we have again been aided by Tex.Atty.Gen.Op. No. Dad-49 (1982) concerning the sufficiency of recitals in the application of a non-partisan or independent candidate for a place on the general election ballot. Looking to that opinion in paragraph "2" of page 1 we find the following question posed:
2. Under Subdivision 5 of Article 13.50, what amount of information is needed to satisfy the requirement of a "signer's address"? If the other information given, along with the list of registered voters in the county, is sufficient to identify a signer as a qualified voter in a particular county, does the address satisfy the requirements of the statute? For example, if a person's street address and the voter's registration number are listed, but there is no city designation, can the signature be counted if the signer's name can be found on the voter's registration list which will provide the city he lives in?
The answer to the posed question is found at pages 2, 3 and 4 of the opinion as follows:
2. In Tyler v. Cook, 573 S.W.2d 567, 570 (Tex.Civ.App.San Antonio 1978), reversed on other grounds 576 S.W.2d 769 (Tex.1978), the court said: "As pointed out above, art. 13.50 does not expressly require ... that the addresses be stated with any degree of specificity."
The same court, however, in a decision construing art. 13.08(d), stated:
It is clear that the legislature intended that something more be given than a post office box or a mere recital of the city of the voter's residence. There is no reason to believe that language clearly indicating that a description of an address which designates no more than the city in which the voter resides is not sufficient, contemplates that the giving of a street number, without a designation of the city, would be sufficient. `201 Main Street' gives even less information than `San Antonio, Texas'. Pierce v. Peters, 599 S.W.2d 849, 851 (Tex.Civ.App.San Antonio, 1980, no writ).
A comparison of art. 13.098(d) and art. 13.50, subd. 5, will show that the statutory language construed in Pierce, supra, is somewhat more specific than the statutory language in question.
Art. 13.08(d) provides, in part:
... The petition must show the following information with respect to each signer: His address (including his street address if residing in a city, and his rural route address if not residing in a city), his current voter registration certificate number (also showing the county of issuance if the office includes more than one county), and the date of signing...
Art. 13.50, subd. 5, provides:
In addition to the person's signature, the application shall show each signer's address, the number of his voter registration certificate, and the date of signing. The legislative purpose of both of the above-cited statutes is to allow verification of signatures. Furthermore, the language used is mandatory, not directive. "Provisions of election laws governing what is required of candidates are mandatory." Geiger v. DeBusk, 534 S.W.2d 437 (Tex.Civ.App.Dallas 1976, no writ). Therefore, it is my opinion that for a signature on an application pursuant to art. 13.50 of the Election Code to be valid it must be accompanied by all four of the required items of information. However since the statutory language in question is not specific as to what detail is required in the address, I am of the opinion that it is unnecessary to reject a signature for a technical deficiency in the recital of the address, where the recital is sufficient for the purpose of verifying the signature. The El Paso Court of Civil Appeals, construing art. 13.08(d), said, "The Election Code does not require just a petition which may be verified. It requires specified information ..." Shields v. Upham, 597 S.W.2d 502, 504 (Tex.Civ.App.El Paso 1980, no writ). This applies as well to independent candidates' applications under art. 13.50. However, the legislature has apparently chosen to be somewhat less specific in its requirements under art. 13.50.

*764 SUMMARY
An application of an independent candidate for a place on the general election ballot must comply with the mandatory provision of V.A.T.S. Election Code, art. 13.50, subds. 4 and 5. Each signature on the application must be accompanied by the signer's address, the number of his voter registration certificate, and the date of signing. The omission of any one of these items is fatal to that signature. The language of art. 13.50, subd. 5, does not require that the signer's address be stated with any certain degree of specificity. An otherwise valid signature should not be rejected when the recital of the signer's address is sufficient for the purpose of verification. (Emphasis added.)
Respondent's Exhibit C at page 2 thereof recognizes 268 valid signatures. To this figure we now add the 133 signatures obtained after the general primary election but prior to June 6, 1982 and the 215 signatures disallowed by respondent because of the alleged insufficient address. By this calculation we find that relator's application included 616 valid signatures and that he is entitled to the relief sought.

DUTY AND RESPONSIBILITY OF COUNTY JUDGE
Tex.Elec.Code Ann. art. 13.52 (Vernon Supp.1982) provides what the County Judge is to do upon the applicant's having fulfilled the requirements of the article.
Upon receipt of an application which conforms to the above requirements ... the county judge shall issue his instruction to the ... county clerk of the county directing that the name of the candidate in whose favor the application is made shall be printed on the official ballot in the independent column under the title of the office for which he is a candidate.... (Emphasis added.)
We hold, therefore, that the election code is mandatory rather than directive as to what the county judge shall do once he receives an application meeting the statutory requirements.
The writ of mandamus will be issued ordering respondent, Edwin E. Brewer, County Judge of Brazoria County, Texas, to certify to the County Clerk of Brazoria County, Texas the name of relator, Harmon Hoot, as a candidate for the office of County Judge of Brazoria County, Texas. His name is to be put on the general election ballot as soon as practicable, but, in any event, prior to September 18, 1982.
DYESS, J., joins in this opinion.
DOYLE, J., dissents.
DOYLE, Justice, dissenting.
I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion ordering that the name of the relator, Harmon Hoot, be placed on the general election ballot as an independent candidate.
It is undisputed that the provisions of the Election Code with reference to the placing of the names of independent candidates upon the general election ballot are mandatory and must be strictly complied with. McWaters v. Tucker, 249 S.W.2d 80 (Tex. Civ.App.Galveston 1952, no writ); Geiger v. DeBusk, 534 S.W.2d 437 (Tex.Civ.App. Dallas 1976, no writ).
The respondent has raised several irregularity issues in connection with the relator's application which warrant serious consideration. Two of such issues concern the sufficiency of addresses appearing on the application and the adequacy of the affidavit required by article 13.51. It is undisputed that if the challenged signers' addresses and affidavits are not allowed to stand, the relator's application would not have the required signatures.
The Election Code, article 13.50, Subdivision 5, provides in part, that "the application shall show each signer's address, ...." The Legislature has not defined "address" in the article. Therefore, we are required to give the word its meaning based on ordinary usage. The addresses under challenge in the case before us fail to include the city in which a number of the signers live. In Tyler v. Cook, 576 S.W.2d 769 (Tex.Sup.Ct.1980), the Texas Supreme *765 Court did not rule on a similar address challenge, finding it unnecessary in order to decide the question before it. However, I can not conceive of an address as employed in the ordinary course of usage, as being complete and meaningful, that gives only a house number or post office box number, and omitting all reference to a city. The cases that have considered the address question under Article 13.08 of the Elec.Code, have uniformly held that the omission of the name of the city in a signer's address is fatal to that name. Shields v. Upham, 597 S.W.2d 502 (Tex.Civ.App.El Paso 1980, no writ); Gray v. Vance, 567 S.W.2d 16 (Tex. Civ.App.Fort Worth 1978, no writ); Pierce v. Peters, 599 S.W.2d 849 (Tex.Civ. App.San Antonio 1980, no writ). Under the rationale found in these cases, I fail to see how the address requirement would be interpreted differently for a signer under Article 13.50 than from one under Article 13.08. With or without the specificity as to address set out in Article 13.08(d), I think we are required to give the word "address" its ordinary meaning until the Legislature defines it.
As to a signer of an application under Article 13.50 of the Election Code making an affidavit to the effect that he has not "voted at either the general primary election or the runoff primary election of any party," when the runoff primary election is yet to come, we are confronted with an impossible situation. No signer can make such an affidavit under the present wording of the statute. In Tyler v. Cook, supra, the dissent of Chief Justice Cadena, of the San Antonio Civil Appeals Court in 573 S.W.2d 567 at page 571, summarizes my position on the affidavit. He states:
Unless we attribute an almost complete lack of knowledge of grammar to our legislators, we cannot escape the conclusion that the statutory scheme requires that the signatures be gathered after the general primary election or the runoff primary election, as the case may be. It is utter foolishness to require a person to state that he has not participated in an event which is not to occur until some future date.
In reversing Tyler v. Cook, supra, Justice Barrow of the Texas Supreme Court reasoned similarly.
I would deny the mandamus and order the cause dismissed.

600 A.2d 525
THELMA LAUTENSLAGER, PLAINTIFFS,
v.
SUPERMARKETS GENERAL CORPORATION, DEFENDANT.
Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division Union County.
Decided June 28, 1991.
*661 Patricia Breuninger (Breuninger, Hansen & Casale, Esqs.), for plaintiff.
Hal R. Crane, Corporate Counsel for Supermarkets General Corporation.

OPINION
MENZA, J.S.C.
Defendant moves for partial summary judgment.
The question presented is which statute of limitations is applicable to a NJLAD case based on employment discrimination.
On May 11, 1989, the plaintiff filed a complaint alleging a continuing pattern of employment discrimination on the part of her current employer, Supermarkets General Corporation. Specifically, the plaintiff contends that she was denied promotional opportunities from 1979 to the present, and that positions for which she was equally qualified were given to younger, usually male employees. Count One of the Complaint alleges violations of the New Jersey Laws Against Discrimination (NJLAD), N.J.S.A. 10:5-1 et seq.
The defendant moves for a partial dismissal of the plaintiff's claims on the grounds that the two-year statute of limitations governing personal injury actions controls the NJLAD claim. The defendant contends, therefore, that all claims of discrimination that relate to events prior to May 11, 1987, are time barred by application of the statute.
The plaintiff argues that the two-year statute is inapplicable to her claims, and that N.J.S.A. 2A:14-1, which provides a six-year statute for actions sounding in property rights, is the most befitting for discrimination claims.
The NJLAD statute does not specify a statute of limitations period of limitations for actions involving employment discrimination.
The limitation of actions statutes provide:

*662 Every action at law for trespass to real property, for any tortious injury to real or personal property, for taking, detaining, or converting personal property, for replevin of goods or chattels, for any tortious injury to the rights of another not stated in sections 2A:14-2 and 2A:14-3 of this Title, or for recovery upon a contractual claim or liability, express or implied, not under seal, or upon an account other than one which concerns the trade or merchandise between merchant and merchant, their factors, agents and servants shall be commenced within 6 years next after the cause of any such action shall have accrued. (N.J.S.A. 2A:14-1).
Every action at law for an injury to the person caused by the wrongful act, neglect or default of any person within this state shall be commenced within 2 years next after the cause of any such action shall have accrued. (N.J.S.A. 2A:14-2).
In Leese v. Doe, 182 N.J. Super. 318, 440 A.2d 1166 (Law Div. 1981), the court addressed the question of which statute of limitations was applicable to the NJLAD claims based on sex discrimination. The court held that the plaintiff's employment discrimination claim was governed by the six year statute of limitations set forth in N.J.S.A. 2A:14-1. In doing so, the court analogized the NJLAD claim to a claim brought under its federal counterpart, 42 U.S.C. § 1981 and cited as authority for its holding the case of Davis v. United States Steel Supply, 581 F.2d 335 (3rd Cir.1978). The Davis case held that a petitioner's § 1981 complaint was one which sounded in property rights, and was therefore actionable under Pennsylvania's six-year statute.
The Davis court said:
Plaintiff's complaint cites incidents of abuse and of personal property damage, but not of bodily injury. The gravamen of the complaint does not concern Mrs. Davis' interest in personal security, but rather involves unlawful interference with her rights as an employee. Mrs. Davis implicitly asserts a right to good faith efforts by an employer to correct instances of co-worker racial harassment and a right not to be discharged for complaining of such incidents. Essentially, Mrs. Davis complains that U.S. Steel Supply demeaned her and fired her because of her race. (Id. at p. 338).
In Skadegaard v. Farrell, 578 F. Supp. 1209 (D.N.J. 1984), the court, also relying on Davis, held that the six year statute was applicable to a NJLAD case based on sexual harassment. The court said:

*663 The relief sought by plaintiff is the key to characterization of a cause of action for statute of limitation purposes, and as in Davis, [i]n terms of legal relief, plaintiff's complaint does not seek damages for bodily injury.' (Id. at p. 1214).
The Davis case, the premise for the Leese and Skadegaard cases, was reversed by the United States Supreme Court in Goodman v. Lukens Steel, 482 U.S. 656, 107 S.Ct. 2617, 96 L.Ed.2d 572 (1987). In that case, which involved racial discrimination, the Supreme Court held that federal courts should select the most applicable state statute of limitations for § 1981 claims, and that the applicable state statute should be the one governing personal injury claims. The court said:
Section 1981 has a much broader focus than contractual rights ... [It] asserts in effect that competence and capacity to contract shall not depend on race. It is thus part of a federal law barring racial discrimination, which, as the court of appeals said, is a fundamental injury to the individual rights of a person ... The Court of Appeals was correct in selecting the Pennsylvania 2-year limitation period governing personal injury actions. (Id. at 661-662, 107 S.Ct. at 2620-2621).
In White v. Johnson & Johnson, 712 F. Supp. 33 (D.N.J. 1989), the District Court applying Goodman rejected Leese and Skadegaard, and held that the two year statute was applicable. The court said:
The New Jersey Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the appropriate statute of limitations in an action under NJLAD. (citation omitted). In the absence of an authoritative pronouncement from the state's highest court, the task of a federal court is to predict how that court would rule.' (citation omitted).
........
The only New Jersey state case cited by the parties that has addressed the issue is Leese v. Doe, 182 N.J. Super. 318, 321, 440 A.2d 1166, 1168 (Law Div. 1981), which ruled that the six-year statute pertaining to claims for injury to property governs NJLAD claims ...
Importantly, however, both Leese and one of the federal cases following it based their holding on the Third Circuit case that was overruled by Goodman in the § 1981 context, namely, Davis v. United States Steel Supply, 581 F.2d 335 (3d Cir.1989).
........
Although it [NJLAD] has wide-ranging economic consequences, it is fundamentally aimed at eliminating the injury that racial discrimination causes to the person of the aggrieved.
........

*664 The Court can only assume that if the issue were before the highest court of New Jersey, that court would do as the Superior Court did in Leese and look to federal law for guidance, but would find the current federal guidance (in contrast to what existed at the time of Leese), to favor application of the personal injury statute of limitations to NJLAD claims. Thus, the Court agrees with defendants the New Jersey Supreme Court would most likely apply the two-year limitations period of N.J.S.A. § 2A:14-1 [sic][1] to NJLAD claims. (Id. at 37-38).
Although there are no New Jersey decisions which have specifically addressed the question, it appears that the New Jersey courts do apply the six year statute of limitations.
In Nolan v. Otis Elevator Co., 197 N.J. Super. 468, 485 A.2d 312 (App.Div. 1984), rev'd on other grounds, 102 N.J. 30, 505 A.2d 580 (1986), cert. den., 479 U.S. 820, 107 S.Ct. 84, 93 L.Ed.2d 38 (1986), a case decided before Goodman, the Supreme Court, in reversing the Appellate Division held that the federal age discrimination in employment act preempted a state court action which was brought under NJLAD after the expiration of the statute of limitations governing the federal act. Although the Supreme Court did not specifically state the statute of limitations applicable to NJLAD claims, the Appellate Division did do so but did it in dicta and without explanation. The court said:
Defendant contends here that the action is barred by the time limitations expressed in the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination and the statute of limitations, N.J.S.A. 2A:14-2.
........
... [W]e conclude that the applicable time limitation is that stated in N.J.S.A. 2A:14-1 "6 years next after the cause of action shall have accrued. (197 N.J. Super. p. 473-474, 485 A.2d 312).
And in Fisher v. Quaker Oats, 233 N.J. Super. 319, 559 A.2d 1 (App.Div. 1989), the court, in the first sentence of its opinion, framed the issue in the case by stating,
"On this appeal, we must determine whether the 6 year period permitted for the filing of an age discrimination complaint under our Law Against Discrimination ... has been preempted by the shorter limitation period of the federal Age *665 Discrimination in Employment Act." (At 320, 559 A.2d 1, citing the Nolan case as authority).
No explanation was thereafter offered by the court as to the reason why the six year statute of limitation was applicable to NJLAD.
The quandary then is this: the Leese case, a law division case, and the Skadegaard case, a federal district court case, each of which held that the six year statute was applicable, was based on a federal circuit court case subsequently reversed by the Supreme Court. The White case also a federal district court case, concluded that the two year statute is applicable and two appellate division cases have stated in dicta, and without explanation, that the six year statute is applicable.
It would seem that the best way for this Court to determine which statute of limitations is applicable to NJLAD is through an evolutionary analysis of N.J.S.A. 2A:14-1 and N.J.S.A. 2A:14-2. The history of New Jersey's statutes of limitations was detailed by the Supreme Court in the case of Earl v. Winne, 14 N.J. 119, 101 A.2d 535 (1953). This history is as follows:
As of February 7, 1779, New Jersey has an "Act for the Limitation of Actions," consisting of 17 subsections. The first two sections of that act are relevant to this inquiry.
The first section was the six-year limitation period. Among other things, it explicitly governed "all actions of account and upon the case, except actions for slander ..." The second section, a four-year statute, covered trespass actions involving direct physical harm such as "assault, menace, battery, wounding and imprisonment ..." A third section applied a two-year statute to "actions upon the case for words," presumably a reference to libel.
In 1874, the statute was revised. The revised statute retained the six-year statute for all actions ... upon the case, and the four-year statute for trespass vi et armis.
*666 In 1896, the legislature again revised the statute adopting a new section which retained the two-year limitation for "action upon the case for words," i.e., libel, but added to the two-year statute "all actions for injuries to the person caused by wrongful act, neglect or default of any person ... The phrase "injuries to persons" was meant to embrace only direct physical injury torts such as "assault, menace, battery, wounding, ..." etc. That new section, the precursor of New Jersey's current two-year statute impliedly repealed Section Two, the four-year statute for trespass vi et armis. It did not repeal the applicability of the six-year statute to actions on the case.
In a 1934 revision, the six-year statute continued to apply to all "actions in the nature of actions upon the case," and was designated R.S. 2:24-1. The two-year statute that originally specified "menace, assault, mayhem, etc.," was replaced by the language of the 1896 revision referring to "injuries to the person" and libel and slander were given a one-year statute in Section Three, now designated R.S. 2:24-3.
In a "recent revision" referred to but not identified by date in Earl, section One of the Act was rewritten and the phrase "any tortious injury to the rights of another" was substituted for specific common law references to "action on the case." See Earl v. Winne, 14 N.J. 119, 129-32, 101 A.2d 535).
The historical analysis makes it clear that the words in the current statute, N.J.S.A. 2A:14-1 (formerly R.S. 2:24-1), "any tortious injury to the rights of another," means all actions "in the nature of actions on the case", whereas, the phrase "injuries to persons," contained in N.J.S.A. 2A:14-2, (formerly R.S. 2:24-2 refers to actions in trespass vi et armis.
How is a NJLAD case to be characterized? Is it an action in the nature of an action on the case or is it one characteristic of a trespass vi et armis?
An action on the case, in Black's Law Dictionary, 51 (4th Ed. 1968), is defined as:

*667 It is founded on the common law or upon acts of Parliament, and lies generally to recover damages for torts not committed with force, actual or implied' or having been occasioned by force where the matter affected was not tangible, or the injury was not immediate but consequential, or where the interest in the property only in reversion, in all of which cases trespass is not sustainable ... In the progress of judicial contestation it was discovered that there was a mass of tortious wrongs unattended by direct and immediate force, or where the force, though direct, was not expended on an existing right of present enjoyment.
A trespass is defined as:
An unlawful act committed with violence, actual or implied, causing injury to the person, property or relative rights of another.
........
In practice a form of action, at the common law, which lies for redress in the shape of money damages for any unlawful injury done to the plaintiff, in respect either to his person, property or rights, by the immediate force a violence of the defendant. (Id. at 1674).
In Osborne v. Butcher, 26 N.J.L. 308 (1857), the New Jersey Supreme Court commented on the distinction between the two common law actions. In that case, the plaintiff filed an action of trespass vi et armis against the defendant for obstructing a road used by the plaintiff for egress from his farm. In holding that the action was properly brought as an action on the case, the court stated:
The gravamen is the obstruction of a by-road, and thereby depriving the plaintiff of its use. The obstructing and blocking up of the road may have been direct, immediate, willful, and forcible, but that was not to, or upon the land of the plaintiff or to his possession; it was not direct and immediate to him. The injury to him was the depriving him of the use of the by-road by reason of such obstruction. It was indirect and consequential, and therefore the subject of an action on the case, and not of trespass. (Id. at 309-10).
And in H.J. Jaegar Research Laboratories v. Radio Corporation of America, 90 F.2d 826, 827 (Cir.1937), the court, in characterizing a cause of action under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act as one similar to an action on the case, said:
... the Acts of New Jersey ... follow the British statute of James I in limiting actions of case to six years. That action was created to meet a recognized need in the administration of justice, namely, a special form of action for particular cases where the ancient form of action did not provide a remedy.
........

*668 `Actions of the case are founded on common law or upon acts of Parliament, and lie generally to recover damages for torts not committed by force, actual or implied;' ... (Id. at 827). (quoting 1 Chit.Pl. 133 and 142).
Historically, therefore, an action of trespass was proper for injury caused by a direct application of force, while an action on the case governed injuries which were indirect and consequential. The language of the current statutes of limitations is derivative of the common law limitation period. N.J.S.A. 2A:14-2 was intended by the legislature to cover claims of actual, physical injury such as negligence, assault and battery, and actions for trespass vi et armis. N.J.S.A. 2A:14-1 was intended to cover indirect injuries, actions on the case. Thus, in Earl v. Winne, supra, the court held that since the tort of false imprisonment involved "immediate wrongs accompanied by force to the person," and the torts of abuse of process and malicious prosecution involved only indirect action against the person, the former tort was covered by the two-year statute, while the latter torts were covered by the six-year statute.
And in Canessa v. Kislak, Inc., 97 N.J. Super. 327, 235 A.2d 62 (Law Div. 1967), the court held that the six-year statute of limitations is applicable to a claim for the tort of "invasion of privacy" involving the appropriation of one's name and likeness. The court reasoned that the two year statute of limitations set forth in N.J.S.A. 2A:14-2 only governs those claims involving direct physical injury and since an invasion of privacy is not an immediate physical affront, but rather a deprivation of a property right, and therefore an indirect tort, it is governed by the six year statute of limitations. Id. at 351, 235 A.2d 62.
Employment discrimination is an offensive, personal violation resulting in deprivation of one's right to equal employment opportunity. It is not a direct personal injury in the traditional sense but rather an indirect one such as that suffered by the farmer in Osborne v. Butcher whose driveway was wrongfully obstructed. The farmer's injury is that he cannot gain access to his house. The employee's injury is the deprivation of the *669 right to employment. Both are indirect injuries; as such, both are in the nature of "actions on the case."
Under the circumstances, this Court is of the opinion that NJLAD claims are characteristic of common law actions on the case. They are therefore governed by the six year statute of limitations: N.J.S.A. 2A:14-1.
Defendant's motion for summary judgment is denied.

                   From the 57th Judicial District Court, Bexar County, Texas
                                Trial Court No. 2014PA02012
                          Honorable Richard Garcia, Judge Presiding

                                         ORDER
        The trial court signed a final judgment on April 28, 2016. Because appellant did not file
a motion for new trial, motion to modify the judgment, motion for reinstatement, or request for
findings of fact and conclusions of law, the notice of appeal was due to be filed on May 18,
2016. See TEX. R. APP. P. 26.1(a). A motion for extension of time to file the notice of appeal
was due on June 2, 2016. See TEX. R. APP. P. 26.3. Although appellant filed a notice of appeal
within the fifteen-day grace period allowed by Rule 26.3, he did not file a motion for extension
of time.

         A motion for extension of time is necessarily implied when an appellant, acting in good
faith, files a notice of appeal beyond the time allowed by Rule 26.1 but within the fifteen-day
grace period provided by Rule 26.3 for filing a motion for extension of time. See Verburgt v.
Dorner, 959 S.W.2d 615, 617 (Tex. 1997) (construing the predecessor to Rule 26). However,
the appellant must offer a reasonable explanation for failing to file the notice of appeal in a
timely manner. See id.; TEX. R. APP. P. 26.3, 10.5(b)(1)(C).

        It is therefore ORDERED that appellant file, within fifteen days from the date of this
order, a response presenting a reasonable explanation for failing to file the notice of appeal in a
timely manner. If appellant fails to respond within the time provided, the appeal will be
dismissed. See TEX. R. APP. P. 42.3(c). All other appellate deadlines are suspended until further
order of this court.

GIBSON, J.
The parties appeared in the trial court in the same order as they appear in this court and will generally be referred to as plaintiffs and defendants.
On August 20, 1947, Dan Ryan filed his petition in this action naming as defendants H.C. Andrewski, L.L. Robinson and the Prudential Insurance Company of America. He alleged a partnership between himself and the personal defendants and the issuance by the Prudential of ten separate insurance policies on his life, all payable to the partnership. He further alleged a dissolution of the partnership on February 29, 1944, and that due to an oversight no mention was made of the policies; that the insurable interest held by the partnership had terminated and although he had requested defendants to make a change, naming his wife as beneficiary, they had failed and refused so to do. He tendered the cash or loan value of the policies and prayed that the defendants be canceled as beneficiaries and that the Insurance Company be required to change the beneficiary as designated by him. On motion the petition was amended, naming the wives of the plaintiff and personal defendants as parties, it appearing that the wives were included as partners in the partnership agreement. Dan Ryan died October 14, 1948, and the action was revived with his widow, as executrix of his estate, named as a party plaintiff.
Issue was joined and the case tried to the court. The Insurance Company pleaded that it was a stakeholder and *200 paid the proceeds of the policies into court, and is not a party to this appeal. Judgment was rendered for defendants, and plaintiffs appeal.
On June 1, 1943, Dan Ryan, Jesse Willis Ryan, his wife, and the named defendants entered into a written partnership agreement to operate under the trade name "Oklahoma Distributing Company" to engage in the manufacture, sale and distribution of beer and other beverages, each partner acquiring an undivided one-sixth interest in all assets. The three husbands were named as managing partners. It was agreed that insurance on the life of each managing partner, in the sum of $50,000, should at all times be maintained and kept in force during the existence of such partnership, the premiums to be charged against the partnership. It was provided that a partner could terminate the partnership on specified notice, with the nonterminating partners having an option of purchase, for cash, and upon payment the partnership and assets should belong to those partners making the purchase, and further:
"Upon any sale as herein provided the nonpurchasers shall thereupon cease to have any interest in the partnership property or its assets, and shall not be liable for any of its unsatisfied obligations or liabilities."
Policies totaling $50,000 were purchased on the life of each of the three managing partners. In the application for Mr. Ryan's policies (ten in number, each for $5,000), Dan I. Ryan was named as "Proposed Insured", Oklahoma Distributing Company was "Applicant", and the beneficiary was named "Oklahoma Distributing Company of Ardmore, Oklahoma, a partnership, as such partnership now exists or may hereafter be constituted."
Attached to each policy was the following endorsement:
"Provisions as to Ownership and Control of the Policy
"Subject to such limitations, if any, as may be hereinafter set forth, all legal incidents of ownership and control of the Policy, including any and all benefits, values, rights and options conferred upon the Insured by the Policy or allowed by the Company and any ultimate interest as beneficiary conferred upon the Insured or the Insured's estate by the Policy, shall belong to the following Owner: Oklahoma Distributing Co. of Ardmore, Okla., a partnership, as such partnership now exists or may hereafter be constituted."
Thereafter the Company assigned all of the policies to Schlitz Brewing Company as collateral security for a loan of $100,000 payable in monthly payments.
About nine months after its organization and on February 29, 1944, Ryan and wife withdrew from the partnership and elected to sell their interests to the other partners for cash, as provided in the partnership agreement.
A new agreement on dissolution was executed by all partners. Among other things, it provided that the partnership was dissolved by mutual agreement; that each of the four remaining partners was to receive an undivided 1/4th interest "in and to all of the business assets and properties, real, personal and/or mixed, including accounts receivable and cash on hand remaining after the distribution of cash herein distributed to Dan Ryan and Jesse Willis Ryan"; that each of the Ryans was to receive in cash out of partnership assets an amount equal to 1/6th of the total net worth of the partnership at the time of its dissolution. Further, that the distributions so made were in full liquidation of said partnership, and the remaining four partners agreed to hold the Ryans harmless from any and all damage and liability occasioned on account of any partnership obligations.
The books were audited by a certified public accountant and on his determination of the total net worth of the partnership Ryan and his wife were paid the sum of $65,118.04 for their 2/6ths interest in the enterprise.
*201 The insurance policies were not specifically mentioned in the dissolution agreement. Some time later Mr. Ryan became ill. He began a series of requests or demands upon the Insurance Company and his former partners, contending that the Distributing Company as it then existed did not own the policy and requesting that the policies be returned and that his wife be named beneficiary. These negotiations were fruitless, and more than three years after dissolution of the partnership Mr. Ryan filed this action.
Plaintiffs contend that the judgment is not supported by the evidence and is contrary to law. It is said that the policies were not disposed of in the written agreement of dissolution and that each partner was entitled to his pro-rata share of the undisposed assets, and that after the dissolution the resultant partnership had no insurable interest. The argument overlooks the provision of the dissolution agreement wherein there was distributed to the four remaining partners "all of the business assets and properties, real, personal and/or mixed ... after the distribution of the cash herein distributed to Dan Ryan and Jesse Willis Ryan etc.", and it overlooks the designated beneficiary which was the Distributing Company "as such partnership now exists or may hereafter be constituted." The accountant who made the audit, upon which the distribution of assets was based, did not list the policies as assets because, at that time, they had no cash value, but throughout the existence of the partnership the partners treated all policies as a business asset and property, and they had used the same to obtain a large loan for partnership use, which loan had not been repaid at the time of the dissolution. As a part of the agreement that obligation was assumed by the remaining partners and plaintiffs were held harmless from liability thereon. The premiums had been paid by the partnership and the sole beneficiary was the partnership.
Miller v. Hall, 65 Cal. A.2d 200, 150 P.2d 287, cited by defendants, is not in point, by reason of the difference in facts from those of the instant case, including the designation of beneficiary. The case does hold that since the premiums were paid by the partnership the interest of the parties in the policies became partnership assets.
Defendants say that a beneficiary irrevocably designated as such in a life policy has a vested right not subject to change at the insured's hand. In making this contention defendant is supported by the great weight of authority.
"It is held by the great weight of authority that the interest of a designated beneficiary in an ordinary life policy vests upon the execution and delivery thereof, and, unless the same contains a provision authorizing a change of beneficiary without the consent thereof, the insured cannot make such change." Condon v. New York Life Ins. Co. of New York, 188 Iowa 658, 166 N.W. 452.
The opinion cites many cases from various jurisdictions in support of the rule announced.
See, also, Page v. Detroit Life Ins. Co., 11 Tenn. App. 417; Ruckenstein v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 263 N.Y. 204, 188 N.E. 650.
At the time of the dissolution agreement all policies were pledged with Schlitz Brewing Company to secure the partnership loan, and there was an unpaid balance of $70,000 on that debt.
"Where partner contracted with his copartner that he should be beneficiary of partner's life policy, partner's attempt to change beneficiary after dissolution of partnership when partner owed money to copartner held ineffective (Rev. St. 1925, art. 5048)." Smith v. Schoellkopf (Tex. Civ. App.) 68 S.W.2d 346.
While admitting that the partnership had an insurable interest in the life of Mr. Ryan, at the time the policies were written, plaintiffs say that there is no insurable interest possessed by *202 the partnership which continued after the dissolution.
"An insurer is the only party who can raise question of insurable interest, and if insurer waives question of interest and pays money to named beneficiary, or into court, neither personal representative nor creditors can claim proceeds on grounds of beneficiary's lack of insurable interest. St. 1935, p. 636, sec. 10110." Jenkins v. Hill, 35 Cal. A.2d 521, 96 P.2d 168.
Defendants say that a valid designation of a beneficiary remains so after the latter's insurable interest or relationship ceases, or, otherwise stated, insurable interest of the beneficiary of a life policy at the time of the death of the insured is immaterial, if it existed when the policy was issued. In support of this contention defendants cite Sinclair Refining Co. v. Long, 139 Kan. 632, 32 P.2d 464, which was a case in many respects similar to the present one. In the opinion the Kansas Supreme Court said:
"... As applied to the situation here presented, the authorities generally are, and the recent ones practically ananimous, that the policy is not a mere contract of indemnity, but is a contract to pay to the beneficiary a certain sum in the event of the death of the insured. The authorities are practically unanimous also in support of the rule that where the insurable interest exists when the policy is issued, and a valid contract of insurance is then effected, it is not defeated by the cessation of the insurable interest unless the terms of the policy so provide. We quote from some of the leading authorities on this question:
"In Grigsby v. Russell, 222 U.S. 149, 32 S.Ct. 58, 59, 56 L. Ed. 133, 36 L.R.A. (N.S.) 642, Ann. Cas. 1913B, 863, it was held: `A valid policy (of insurance) is not avoided by the cessation of the insurable interest, even as against the insurer, unless so provided by the policy itself.'
"In Conn. Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Schaefer, 94 U.S. 457, 24 L. Ed. 251, it was held: `A policy of life insurance originally valid does not cease to be so by the cessation of the assured's party's interest in the life insured, unless such be the necessary effect of the provisions of the instrument itself.'
"In Wurzburg v. N.Y. Life Ins. Co., 140 Tenn. 59, 203 S.W. 332, L.R.A. 1918E, 566, it was held: `A manufacturing company has an insurable interest in the life of its manager, who is its guiding spirit and is largely carrying on its business. Where a manufacturing company took out a valid policy on the life of its general manager, who later severed his connection with the company, and it paid all premiums until his death, it was entitled to the whole of the insurance.'"
We need not lengthen this opinion with the many additional citations, but we observe that defendants' above proposition is sustained by the great weight of authority.
These involved insurance policies were business policies purchased for the protection of the partnership, and were designed to enchance the growth and success of the partnership undertaking. The designation of the beneficiary was an irrevocable designation. All partners then intended, just as set out in the provision of the policies, that all legal incidents of ownership and control of their respective policies and all benefits and rights conferred on the insured by the policies should belong to the Oklahoma Distributing Company as it then existed or as it might thereafter be constituted. The use of the policies for partnership purposes was intended from the day the partnership agreement was executed. Their continued use as collateral for the Schlitz Company loan until that debt was paid was contemplated by all parties when the dissolution agreement was signed,  an obligation which the remaining partners assumed while the plaintiffs were to be released therefrom. At that time the obligation was in excess of the total amount of Mr. Ryan's policies. It was then contemplated by the parties that the continuing partnership, of the four remaining partners, would meet that obligation. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the parties intended that as soon as the four remaining *203 partners used their own money to pay off the Schlitz indebtedness they would turn the policies over to Mr. Ryan or that he was to receive any further benefit from them. In all these transactions the insurance policies were treated as partnership property.
Under the dissolution agreement Ryan and wife were paid cash for their interests in the partnership as specified in the partnership agreement in the event of a withdrawal of any partner. After use of the cash needed to pay them, "all of the business assets and properties, real personal and mixed" were assigned to the four remaining partners. Ryan and wife joined in this assignment. None of the assets were itemized or given specific mention. The insurance policies of all partners were and had been treated as business assets. In the audit upon which the amounts due to Ryan and wife were computed, the prepaid premiums were listed as assets. Thus Ryan and wife were reimbursed for their pro-rata share of premiums theretofore paid and withheld from all partners during the operation of the business. It cannot be said that the failure to mention the policies in the agreement was due to an oversight since the same thing could be said of any other assets. None was given specific mention. The parties intended the assignment to cover all assets remaining after the cash payment, and so said.
Plaintiffs contend that the court erred in refusing to permit Mrs. Ryan to testify as to her understanding as to the taking out of the insurance policies. Following the court's ruling the plaintiffs tendered the following written offer of proof:
"Plaintiff's Tender in Connection with Testimony of Jesse Willis Ryan, Wife of Deceased.
"2. That Mrs. Ryan, wife of deceased, if permitted to testify would testify that it was her understanding as a partner that the insurance was only to be carried on Dan Ryan's life during the existence of the Partnership."
To avoid the rule against use of parol evidence to vary the terms of a written agreement, plaintiffs contend that parol evidence was admissible to show that the written agreement was not intended to cover the subject of the policies, and cite 32 C.J.S. 1027, and numerous cases dealing with the admission of evidence to show the intent of the parties where the written instrument is ambiguous. We do not find ambiguity in the contract. As heretofore stated the parties were disposing of business assets and they had treated the policies as business assets. The offer was in conflict with the rule against admission of parol evidence to vary the terms of a written contract.
Defendants also contend that there was error in the refusal of evidence that the omission of provision for disposition of the insurance policies was because of a mutual mistake of the parties. Mrs. Ryan was permitted to testify that the insurance policies were not mentioned or considered in the negotiations of settlement. There was no evidence of a mutual mistake of fact and no offer of evidence to establish a mutuality of mistake. There was no plea for reformation of the settlement contract because of a mutual mistake. The trial court did not err in refusing to admit the suggested testimony.
Affirmed.

Petition for Writ of Mandamus.
Before:  FLETCHER, FARRIS and KOZINSKI, Circuit Judges.
KOZINSKI, Circuit Judge.


1
Kelvin Shelby Malone, currently incarcerated in California, is under sentence of death both in that state and in Missouri.  His federal habeas petition in California is in its initial stages.  By contrast, habeas review of Malone's Missouri conviction and sentence is almost complete;  the Eighth Circuit has the case under submission.  Because Malone's Missouri execution date may be imminent, the governor of Missouri made a formal request to the governor of California asking that Malone be released into Missouri's custody.  See Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, Cal.Penal Code §§ 1547-1556.2 and Mo.Rev.Stat. §§ 548.011-548.300.  The governor of California agreed and the two entered into an executive agreement providing for Malone's extradition to Missouri.  Malone unsuccessfully challenged the extradition in California state court and also sought a stay from the district court with jurisdiction over his California-based habeas petition.  The district court granted the requested relief;  it entered an order staying the extradition unless certain conditions were met (most notably, that Missouri submit to the district court's jurisdiction).  In its petition for a writ of mandamus California seeks to have that ruling reversed.


2
Mandamus is not to be used as a substitute for an appeal:  "[A] court of appeals has no occasion to engage in extraordinary review by mandamus ... when it can exercise the same review by a contemporaneous ordinary appeal."  Moses H. Cone Mem'l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr.  Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 8 n. 6, 103 S.Ct. 927, 933 n. 6, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983).  See also Calderon v. United States Dist. Court, 134 F.3d 981, 983-84 (9th Cir.1998) (mandamus not available when petitioner could have filed direct appeal);  Herrington v. County of Sonoma, 706 F.2d 938, 940 (9th Cir.1983) (same);  Bauman v. United States Dist. Court, 557 F.2d 650, 654 (9th Cir.1977) (same).  The district court's order was not a final judgment, so the state could not have appealed it under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.  But was it the kind of interlocutory order that could have been appealed as of right pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292?


3
Under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1) interlocutory injunctions are immediately appealable.1  That the district court here did not label its order an injunction is not dispositive.  In determining whether an order is appealable under section 1292(a)(1), we consider the substantial effect of the order.  See Tagupa v. East-West Ctr., Inc., 642 F.2d 1127, 1129 (9th Cir.1981) (looking not to form of district court's order but to its actual effect);  Santana Prods., Inc. v. Compression Polymers, Inc., 8 F.3d 152, 154 (3rd Cir.1993) (same);  Sierra Club v. Marsh, 907 F.2d 210, 213 (1st Cir.1990) (same);  11A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure, § 2962 (2d ed.1995) (same).


4
At Malone's request, the district court entered an order prohibiting California from turning him over to Missouri.  Were the state to ignore the order and release Malone into Missouri's custody, it could surely be brought before the district court to answer contempt charges.  This order thus restrains a party, on penalty of contempt, from taking an action that it could otherwise take.  We have no trouble concluding that the order is in fact an injunction.  Had California filed a timely notice of appeal, we would have had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).2


5
Because California could have obtained review of the district court's order through an ordinary appeal, mandamus is not available.  Had the state filed its mandamus petition within the time allowed for filing a notice of appeal, we would have treated it as a notice of appeal and reached the merits.  See Helstoski v. Meanor, 442 U.S. 500, 508 n. 4, 99 S.Ct. 2445, 2449 n. 4, 61 L.Ed.2d 30 (1979);  Diamond v. United States Dist. Court, 661 F.2d 1198, 1198-99 (9th Cir.1981).  But it did not.3  The state is thus in the same unhappy position as other litigants who failed to comply with jurisdictional requirements for perfecting an appeal.  See Pratt v. McCarthy, 850 F.2d 590, 591 (9th Cir.1988), overruled on other grounds Pioneer Inv. Servs.  Co. v. Brunswick Assoc.  Ltd. Partnership, 507 U.S. 380, 113 S.Ct. 1489, 123 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993);  Mann v. Lynaugh, 840 F.2d 1194, 1197 (5th Cir.1988).  While we harbor serious doubts about the district court's order, it is not reviewable by writ of mandamus.


6
DISMISSED.



1
 Section 1292(a) was not mentioned by the state in its briefs and the deputy attorney general who argued the case seemed unaware of its existence when asked about it.  This is not unusual.  See McLain v. Calderon, 134 F.3d 1383, 1384 n.3 (9th Cir.1998)


2
 Because the order is not explicitly labeled an injunction, it is arguable that the requirements of Carson v. American Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 101 S.Ct. 993, 67 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981), would have had to have been satisfied before an immediate appeal could have been taken.  Carson held that, to be appealable under section 1292(a)(1), a district court ruling must (1) have the practical effect of entering an injunction, (2) have serious, perhaps irreparable, consequences, and (3) be such that an immediate appeal is the only effective way to challenge it.  Id. at 84, 101 S.Ct. at 996-97.  Carson involved an order denying relief;  it is unclear whether Carson also applies when the order in question grants injunctive relief.  For the reasons explained in Cohen v. Board of Trustees of Univ. of Medicine and Dentistry, 867 F.2d 1455, 1466-67 (3rd Cir.1989), it may well not.  However, we have not been consistent on this point, sometimes applying Carson to determine the appealability of orders granting relief, see e.g., Thompson v. Enomoto, 815 F.2d 1323, 1326-27 (9th Cir.1987), and other times not, see e.g., United States v. Gila Valley Irrigation Dist., 31 F.3d 1428, 1441 (9th Cir.1994).  Here it doesn't matter.  We have already held that the first Carson requirement is satisfied, see p. 1422 supra;  if the second and third requirements are not satisfied, the state would, a fortiori, not be entitled to mandamus.  See Bauman v. United States Dist. Court, 557 F.2d 650, 654 (9th Cir.1977)

 The time to file a notice of appeal expired on January 26, 1997;  the state filed its petition on February 12, 1997

Counsel for plaintiff has presented the contentions of his client, both as to the facts and law, with thoroughness, force and competency. These contentions have been fully considered in our review of the record. However, we find nothing which justifies a remand of the cause or a reversal of the judgment below. Review in Supreme Court is limited to questions of law and legal inference. The findings of fact of the Industrial Commission are conclusive on appeal when supported by competent evidence, even though there be evidence that would support findings to the contrary. The record in this case contains competent supporting evidence for each finding of fact. The findings are positive and cover all crucial facts upon which the right to compensation depends. The facts found support the conclusion that plaintiff's injury did not arise out of and in the course of his employment with defendant employer. Bell v.

          ORDER DENYING CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY *


Before KELLY, HARTZ, and HOLMES, Circuit Judges.


      Petitioner Richard Kirby, a former New Mexico state prisoner proceeding

pro se, 1 seeks a Certificate of Appealability (“COA”) to appeal the district court’s



      *
              This Order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of
law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however,
for its persuasive value consistent with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32.1
and Tenth Circuit Rule 32.1.

      After examining the appellate record, this three-judge panel determined
unanimously that oral argument would not be of material assistance in the
determination of this appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G).
The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.
      1
             Because Mr. Kirby is proceeding pro se, we construe his filings
liberally. See Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (per curiam); Van
Deelen v. Johnson, 497 F.3d 1151, 1153 n.1 (10th Cir. 2007).
denial of: (1) his 28 U.S.C. § 2254 habeas petition; (2) his “Petition for Coram

Nobis,” which the district court construed as a supplemental § 2254 habeas

pleading; and (3) his Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 59(e) motion, which

the district court construed as a second or successive § 2254 habeas petition. Mr.

Kirby also seeks to challenge the district court’s refusal to expand the record or

grant an evidentiary hearing below. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.

§§ 1291 and 2253(a), we deny Mr. Kirby’s request for a COA on all claims and

dismiss his appeal.

                                 BACKGROUND

      Mr. Kirby was convicted by jury in state court of fraud over $250. 2 His

conviction was “based on evidence that [he] hired Loren Collett to design a

website for him, and then failed to pay Mr. Collett.” R., Vol. I, at 25 (State Ct.

Mem. Op., filed May 10, 2005). More specifically, as described by the federal

magistrate judge in this case:



      2
             The New Mexico fraud statute in effect when Mr. Kirby was indicted
and convicted read, in part: “Whoever commits fraud when the value of the
property misappropriated or taken is over two hundred fifty dollars ($250) but not
more than twenty-five hundred dollars ($2,500) is guilty of a fourth degree
felony.” N.M. Stat. Ann. § 30-16-6 (1987); see also R., Vol. I, at 35 (State v.
Kirby, 161 P.3d 883, 884 (N.M. 2007)) (“Defendant was charged with one count
of fraud over $250 but less than $2,500, a fourth degree felony.” (citing N.M.
Stat. Ann. § 30-16-6 (1987))).

       The statute was amended in 2006. Under the amended fraud provision,
fraud over $250 but less than $500 is a misdemeanor, while fraud over $500 but
less than $2,500 is a fourth degree felony. See N.M. Stat. Ann. § 30-16-6 (2006).

                                          3
             Kirby owned a small business. He hired the victim, Loren
             Collett, to design and develop a website and the two entered into
             a website design contract under which Kirby was to pay Collett
             $1,890 for his design services. Collett provided the designs and
             incorporated them into Kirby’s website, but Kirby did not pay
             him. When Collett allegedly changed the password to prevent
             Kirby from utilizing the designs, Kirby, who claims he was the
             “designated administrator” of the website, had the web space
             provider reset the password thereby blocking Collett’s attempts
             to secure the designs pending payment for services.

Id. at 873–74 (Magistrate Judge’s Proposed Findings & Recommended

Disposition, filed Nov. 4, 2010).

      The New Mexico district court sentenced Mr. Kirby to eighteen months’

incarceration, followed by one year of supervised release. The conviction and

sentence were ultimately affirmed by the New Mexico Supreme Court in 2007.

The district attorney then filed a Supplemental Criminal Information asserting

that Mr. Kirby qualified as a habitual offender under N.M. Stat. Ann. § 31-18-

17B, and therefore his sentence should be increased by four years as required by

that provision. See N.M. Stat. Ann. § 31-18-17B (“A person convicted of a

noncapital felony in this state . . . who has incurred two prior felony convictions

that were parts of separate transactions or occurrences or conditional discharge

. . . is a habitual offender and his basic sentence shall be increased by four

years.”). The trial court agreed and issued an amended judgment, which added

four years to Mr. Kirby’s prison sentence, resulting in a sixty-six-month sentence.

Mr. Kirby then appealed the sentence enhancement.



                                          4
      In September 2008, while the sentence appeal was pending in state court,

Mr. Kirby filed a habeas application pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254 in the United

States District Court for the District of New Mexico. In December 2009, Mr.

Kirby filed a “Petition for Coram Nobis” with the federal district court, which

both informed the court that the state courts had rejected his sentence appeal and

asserted several challenges to the sentence enhancement. 3 “[A]s of August 19,

2010, Kirby had completed both the original and enhanced sentences, as well as

the period of parole associated with the fraud conviction.” R., Vol. I, at 869.

      In his § 2254 habeas application, Mr. Kirby raised ten challenges: (1) “the

fraud conviction violates his due process rights because it involved an

unforeseeable interpretation of the law,” id. at 873; (2) his due-process rights

were violated because “the New Mexico fraud statute is vague as applied to him,”

id. at 879; (3) the New Mexico state court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, id.

at 881; (4) there was insufficient evidence adduced at trial to demonstrate “that

someone other than [Mr. Kirby] owned the website,” a required element under the

state fraud statute, id. at 882–83; (5) the restitution award issued against him was

impermissible, id. at 883–84; (6) his “due process rights were violated by the



      3
             The State initially sought dismissal of the habeas application on the
ground that Mr. Kirby’s appeal of the sentence enhancement was still pending,
and thus his available state-court remedies had not been exhausted. However, Mr.
Kirby’s petition for coram nobis established that his sentence enhancement had
become final with the New Mexico Supreme Court, which satisfied the exhaustion
requirement.

                                          5
prosecution’s failure to disclose that a fact witness, Rob Narvaez, would also be

called upon as an expert to give testimony as to the value of the web page work,”

id. at 884; (7) his trial counsel was ineffective, id. at 885–86; (8) the trial court

impermissibly limited the testimony of two defense witnesses, id. at 886; (9) there

was insufficient evidence adduced at trial “to show that the website had a market

value of over $250,” id. at 887–88; and (10) “his conviction violates due process

principles because a fraud conviction cannot be based on unfulfilled promises or

statements as to future events,” id. at 888. Mr. Kirby also raised several

challenges to the habitual-offender sentence enhancement, and requested that the

district court expand the record.

      Adopting the recommendations of the magistrate judge, the district court

first held that Mr. Kirby’s challenges to the sentence enhancement—raised in his

petition for coram nobis, “which the [district court] construe[d] as a

supplement[al] [habeas] pleading,” id. at 867—were moot because he had

completed his sentence and probation and had not demonstrated any collateral

consequences flowing from the enhancement. The district court also rejected all

of Mr. Kirby’s challenges to his conviction and original sentence, refused to

permit an expansion of the record, and dismissed the initial habeas petition with

prejudice and his supplemental habeas petition (i.e., the coram-nobis petition

regarding the sentence enhancement) without prejudice. The district court

declined to grant Mr. Kirby a COA.


                                            6
      Mr. Kirby then filed a Rule 59(e) motion, which essentially reargued

several of the issues that had been previously raised and rejected in the federal

habeas proceedings. The district court concluded that “Kirby’s motion constitutes

a second or successive petition,” and dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction because

the petition had not been authorized by this court under 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b). Id.

at 946 (Mem. Op. & Order, filed Mar. 25, 2011).

      Mr. Kirby now seeks a COA to appeal the district court’s denial of his

§ 2254 habeas petition, his supplemental § 2254 habeas pleading (i.e., his coram-

nobis petition), and his Rule 59(e) motion. Mr. Kirby also seeks to challenge the

district court’s refusal to expand the record or grant an evidentiary hearing. In

total, he raises nine challenges on appeal: (1) the district court erred in denying

Mr. Kirby’s Rule 59(e) motion; (2) the evidence failed to conform to the

unopposed jury instructions; (3) his conviction violates his due-process rights

because it involved an unforeseeable interpretation of the state fraud statute; (4)

his due-process rights were violated because the state fraud statute is vague as

applied to him; (5) there was insufficient evidence produced at trial to

demonstrate that someone other than Mr. Kirby owned the website; (6) there was

insufficient evidence produced at trial to demonstrate that the website had a value

in excess of $250; (7) his conviction should be vacated because a fraud conviction

cannot be predicated on unfulfilled promises; (8) the district court erred in

holding that the challenges to his sentence enhancement were moot; and (9) the


                                          7
district court erred in refusing to expand the record or hold an evidentiary

hearing. Each issue is addressed in turn.

                                   DISCUSSION

I.    Standard of Review

      A COA is a jurisdictional prerequisite to this court’s review of a habeas

application. 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(1)(A); accord Clark v. Oklahoma, 468 F.3d

711, 713 (10th Cir. 2006) (citing Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 336

(2003)). We will issue a COA only if the applicant “makes a ‘substantial showing

of the denial of a constitutional right.’” Clark, 468 F.3d at 713 (quoting 28

U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2)). Under this standard, “the applicant must show ‘that

reasonable jurists could debate whether . . . the petition should have been

resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to

deserve encouragement to proceed further.’” United States v. Taylor, 454 F.3d

1075, 1078 (10th Cir. 2006) (quoting Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484

(2000)). Put differently, “the applicant must show that the district court’s

resolution of the constitutional claim was either ‘debatable or wrong.’” Id.

(quoting Slack, 529 U.S. at 484). Furthermore, when the district court denies

relief to an applicant “on procedural grounds, the applicant faces a double hurdle.

Not only must the applicant make a substantial showing of the denial of a

constitutional right, but he must also show ‘that jurists of reason would find it

debatable . . . whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.’”

Coppage v. McKune, 534 F.3d 1279, 1281 (10th Cir. 2008) (quoting Slack, 529

U.S. at 484).

         To the extent that the state court decided Mr. Kirby’s claims on the merits,

the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (“AEDPA”) applies,

and we must incorporate AEDPA’s “deferential treatment of state court decisions

. . . into our consideration of [Mr. Kirby’s] request for [a] COA.” Dockins v.

Hines, 374 F.3d 935, 938 (10th Cir. 2004). Under AEDPA, Mr. Kirby is entitled

to federal habeas relief only if he can show that the state court’s adjudication of

the claim:

                (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an
                unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as
                determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or

                (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable
                determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in
                the State court proceeding.

28 U.S.C. § 2254(d); accord Phillips v. Workman, 604 F.3d 1202, 1209 (10th Cir.

2010).

         When making our determination, “[w]e presume the factual findings of the

state court are correct unless the petitioner rebuts that presumption by ‘clear and

convincing evidence.’” Welch v. Workman, 639 F.3d 980, 991 (10th Cir. 2011)

(quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1)).

II.      Dismissal of Rule 59(e) Motion for Lack of Jurisdiction

         Mr. Kirby’s first issue asks “[w]hether the district court’s characterization


                                            9
of [his] timely Rule 59(e) Motion . . . as a successive petition” and the court’s

consequent dismissal of his motion for lack of jurisdiction constitute error. Aplt.

Combined Opening Br. & Appl. for COA at 4 [hereinafter Aplt. Combined Br.].

To the extent that Mr. Kirby is challenging the district court’s characterization of

his Rule 59(e) motion as a second or successive petition, his position is untenable.

Mr. Kirby’s motion plainly reargues the issues presented to and rejected by the

district court in the habeas proceeding. Cf. United States v. Pedraza, 466 F.3d

932, 933 (10th Cir. 2006) (stating that “a purported Rule 60(b) motion that ‘in

substance or effect asserts or reasserts a federal basis for relief from the

petitioner’s underlying conviction’ is actually a second or successive habeas

petition” (quoting Spitznas v. Boone, 464 F.3d 1213, 1215 (10th Cir. 2006))).

       Furthermore, it is well-settled that “[a] district court does not have

jurisdiction to address the merits of a second or successive . . . § 2254 claim until

this court has granted the required authorization [under§ 2244(b)],” In re Cline,

531 F.3d 1249, 1251 (10th Cir. 2008), and it is undisputed that Mr. Kirby did not

seek (or obtain) such authorization. Consequently, the district court did not err in

dismissing the successive petition for lack of jurisdiction. Reasonable jurists

could not disagree with this outcome.

III.   Jury Instructions and Law of the Case

       Mr. Kirby frames his second issue in the following manner:

             Whether the unopposed jury instruction “This website belonged


                                              10
             to someone other than the defendant” became an element of the
             case and formed the law of the case[,] and because the only
             evidence presented at trial on the status of the ownership of the
             website was from the alleged victim stating “Mr. Kirby was the
             owner and administrator”, the conviction must be vacated?

Aplt. Combined Br. at 5.

      To the extent that Mr. Kirby is raising a sufficiency-of-the-evidence

challenge regarding whether someone other that Mr. Kirby owned the website—a

required element of the fraud charge—we address that contention in Part VI infra.

However, insofar as Mr. Kirby is bringing a challenge related to the jury

instructions or the law-of-the-case doctrine, he did not raise these issues before

the district court. Generally, we “will not consider an issue raised for the first

time on appeal.” Tele-Commc’ns, Inc. v. Comm’r of Internal Revenue, 12 F.3d

1005, 1007 (10th Cir. 1993). Mr. Kirby’s failure to argue for application of the

plain-error standard in this instance “surely marks the end of the road for [this]

argument for reversal not first presented to the district court.” Richison v. Ernest

Grp., Inc., 634 F.3d 1123, 1131 (10th Cir. 2011). 4

IV.   Due Process—Fair Warning

      Under Mr. Kirby’s next claim, he argues that his due-process rights were

violated because he was not given fair warning of the statute’s scope. As the



      4
             In fact, Mr. Kirby raises several arguments for the first time on
appeal, and nowhere in his briefing before this court does he assert that the plain-
error standard should apply to these claims. Accordingly, as discussed throughout
this Order, all of Mr. Kirby’s late-blooming challenges are clearly waived.

                                          11
district court framed it, “Kirby attacks his state-court fraud conviction on the

grounds that he was convicted of a new and novel principle of law in violation of

due process that neither the statute nor any prior judicial decision has fairly

disclosed to be within the statute’s scope.” R., Vol. I, at 916 (Mem. Op. & Order

Adopting Magistrate Judge’s Proposed Findings & Recommended Disposition,

filed Dec. 30, 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). “This ‘novel principle,’

according to Kirby, is the principle that the designer of web pages may be found

to be the owner of the website on which they are displayed.” Id.; see Aplt.

Combined Br. at 11 (arguing that he was not given “fair warning . . . in language

a person of ordinary intelligence would [understand] that a webpage designer

would own the website they designed the pages for”).

      Mr. Kirby presented this challenge in his state post-conviction proceedings.

The New Mexico Supreme Court—“having considering [Mr. Kirby’s] petition,

and being sufficiently advised [on the matter]”—denied his due-process

challenge. R., Vol. I, at 94 (Order, dated Aug. 8, 2008). Applying AEDPA

deference, the district court (adopting the magistrate judge’s recommendation)

held that the New Mexico Supreme Court’s adjudication of this claim was neither

contrary to nor an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent. 5 Id. at

      5
             The magistrate judge concluded, and the district court agreed, that
“[t]he New Mexico Supreme Court’s disposition of Kirby’s state habeas petition,
though summary, qualifies as a disposition on the merits and is therefore entitled
to deferential review.” R., Vol. I, at 876 (citing Aycox v. Lytle, 196 F.3d 1174,
                                                                       (continued...)

                                          12
879, 919.

      Before this court, Mr. Kirby has utterly failed to demonstrate that he is

entitled to relief—that is, he has not shown “that reasonable jurists would find the

district court’s assessment of the [due process] claim[] debatable or wrong.”

Slack, 529 U.S. at 484. In his combined brief, Mr. Kirby spends three pages

laying out what he deems to be the applicable legal framework for his due-process

challenge, citing the holdings of both the Supreme Court and the Tenth Circuit.

However, he does not even attempt to explain why he is entitled to relief under

that framework, and he makes no effort to specifically discuss the district court’s

resolution of this claim, much less explain how reasonable jurists could debate the

correctness of that resolution. This is insufficient to carry his burden.

Specifically, Mr. Kirby’s conclusory assertion that his due-process rights were

violated—without any factual foundation or legal analysis to support his

claim—does not entitle him to relief. See, e.g., Walker v. Gibson, 228 F.3d 1217,

      5
        (...continued)
1177–78 (10th Cir. 1999)). In Aycox, we noted that “a summary decision . . . can
constitute an ‘adjudication on the merits’ for purposes of § 2254(d), provided that
the decision was reached on substantive rather than procedural grounds.” 196
F.3d at 1177. This is particularly true where “[t]here is no evidence . . . that the
state court did not consider and reach the merits of [the petitioner’s] claim.” Id.
In this case, the New Mexico Supreme Court’s explicitly stated that it had
“considered” and “be[en] sufficiently advised [on]” the issue before denying it,
R., Vol. I, at 94, and there is no indication that the denial was based on
procedural grounds. Furthermore, Mr. Kirby does not object to the district court’s
characterization of the New Mexico Supreme Court’s decision. Accordingly, the
district court properly applied AEDPA’s deferential standard of review to this
claim.

                                         13
1240 (10th Cir. 2000) (stating that “unsupported and undeveloped [habeas]

issues” do not entitle a petitioner to relief (quoting Moore v. Gibson, 195 F.3d

1152, 1180 n.17 (10th Cir. 1999)) (internal quotation marks omitted)), abrogated

on other grounds by Neill v. Gibson, 278 F.3d 1044 (10th Cir. 2001).

Accordingly, he is not entitled to a COA on this issue.

V.     Due Process—Vagueness

       Mr. Kirby brings a second, related due-process challenge, arguing that the

fraud statute is vague as applied to him. More specifically, he argues that the

statute is void for vagueness because neither the statute nor any prior judicial

decision put him on notice that his actions—i.e., preventing Mr. Collett from

accessing the web pages he created and copyrighted—were subject to criminal

liability.

       The district court, accepting the magistrate judge’s recommendation, held

that Mr. Kirby was not entitled to habeas relief on this claim. “Objections to

vagueness under the Due Process Clause rest on the lack of notice, and hence may

be overcome in any specific case where reasonable persons would know that their

conduct is at risk.” R., Vol. I, at 880 (quoting Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U.S.

356, 361 (1988)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court concluded

that the fraud statute—providing that “[f]raud consists of the intentional

misappropriation or taking of anything of value which belongs to another by

means of fraudulent conduct, practices or representations,” N.M. Stat. Ann. § 30-


                                         14
16-6—was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to Mr. Kirby because “[a]

person of ordinary intelligence would understand that the designer of the web

pages has an ownership interest in the website on which the pages are displayed,”

R., Vol. I, at 880. Thus, “[e]ven if Kirby owned the domain name and the

webspace, Collett owned the designs and the copyright to the pages displayed on

the website,” and “[b]y blocking Collett from accessing the website before paying

him for the designs, Kirby should have known that his conduct was at risk for

criminal liability.” Id. at 880–81. Reasonable jurists could not disagree with this

outcome.

      Mr. Kirby first argues that the decision of the New Mexico Supreme Court,

and the recommendation of the federal magistrate judge, were based on a factual

error—viz., “the fallacious premise that [he] had barred access to Collett.” Aplt.

Combined Br. at 15. The district court considered and rejected this argument.

Reasonable jurists could not debate the correctness of this resolution. 6 Assuming,

arguendo, that the factual determination that Mr. Kirby excluded or barred Mr.

      6
             The district court apparently viewed Mr. Kirby’s factual-error
challenge as part and parcel of his request to expand the record. However, we are
constrained to disagree. Before the district court, Mr. Kirby raised his factual-
error argument in the context of his objections to the magistrate judge’s
recommendation. See R., Vol. I, at 890. The argument was not necessarily a
component of his request for leave to expand the record. Moreover, in seeking a
COA from this court, Mr. Kirby is quite clear that the factual-error argument is
part of his vagueness challenge. Although we do not view the factual-error issue
as falling under the umbrella of Mr. Kirby’s request to expand the record, as
noted above, we conclude that the district court’s ultimate resolution of the
challenge could not be debated by reasonable jurists.

                                         15
Collett was incorrect, Mr. Kirby would still not be entitled to relief because that

determination was not “an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the

evidence presented.” 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2). Section 2254(d)(2) does not

instruct federal courts to determine whether the state court made a correct

determination, but rather whether the state court made an unreasonable

determination. In this case, Mr. Collett stated that “the password [was] changed

from what [he] had changed it to,” and he “did [not] know what the password had

been changed to.” Dist. Ct. Doc. 37-2 at 57 (Aug. 13, 2010). He further stated

that the change “kept [him] from removing all the files [he] had created,” and that

he could “no longer access it” because Mr. Kirby “had taken control of the

website.” Id. Thus, based on this testimony, it cannot be said that the factual

determination that Mr. Kirby excluded or barred Mr. Collett was unreasonable.

The district court correctly rejected Mr. Kirby’s factual-error argument.

      As to the legal merits of the vagueness challenge, we conclude that Mr.

Kirby is not entitled to a COA on this issue. Our holding is based on

substantially the same grounds as articulated by the magistrate judge and adopted

by the district court. In order to succeed under this challenge, Mr. Kirby was

required to demonstrate that the New Mexico fraud statute failed to give him “fair

warning, at the time of [his] conduct . . . , that the act for which [he] now stand[s]

convicted was rendered criminal by the statute.” Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378

U.S. 347, 355 (1964). His challenge can “be overcome . . . [if] reasonable


                                          16
persons would know that their conduct is at risk” under the statute. Maynard, 486

U.S. at 361. As the magistrate judge correctly concluded, and the district court

recognized, “[a] person of ordinary intelligence would understand that the

designer of the web pages has an ownership interest in the website on which the

pages are displayed,” R., Vol. I, at 880—especially when the designer has not

been paid for that design work. Therefore, “[b]y blocking Collett from accessing

the website before paying him for the designs, Kirby should have known that his

conduct was at risk for criminal liability.” Id. at 880–81. Reasonable jurists

could not disagree with this outcome.

      Mr. Kirby argues, as he did before the district court, that “there is a need

for [the] court to locate a published decision[] with fundamentally similar facts[,]

prior to Kirby’s actions[,] to be able to [overcome] the vagueness challenge [and

thereby] allow affirmation of Kirby’s conviction.” Aplt. Combined Br. at 17

(emphasis added). Contrary to Mr. Kirby’s assertion, however, this statement

does not reflect the Supreme Court’s (or Tenth Circuit’s) vagueness

jurisprudence. It appears, as the district court noted, that Mr. Kirby may be

confusing the vagueness doctrine with the doctrine of qualified immunity. To

defeat a claim of qualified immunity, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the

constitutional right allegedly violated “was clearly established at the time of the

alleged unlawful activity,” Swanson v. Town of Mountain View, Colo., 577 F.3d

1196, 1199 (10th Cir. 2009); “[o]rdinarily, in order for the law to be clearly


                                          17
established, there must be a Supreme Court or Tenth Circuit decision on point, or

the clearly established weight of authority from other courts must have found the

law to be as the plaintiff maintains,” Medina v. City & Cnty. of Denver, 960 F.2d

1493, 1498 (10th Cir. 1992) (emphasis added), overruled in part by Williams v.

City & Cnty. of Denver, 99 F.3d 1009 (10th Cir. 1996). The law of qualified

immunity, however, has no bearing on whether Mr. Kirby has successfully

asserted a vagueness challenge. Accordingly, this argument is unavailing. 7 Mr.

Kirby is not entitled to a COA on this claim.

VI.   Sufficiency of the Evidence—Ownership of the Website

      Mr. Kirby next argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his

conviction. More specifically, he argues there was not “any evidence, much less

substantial evidence, produced at trial [to demonstrate] that someone other than

[Mr. Kirby] owned the website.” Aplt. Combined Br. at 18. 8 In assessing a


      7
              Mr. Kirby also briefly argues that we should apply the rule of lenity
in this case and construe the fraud statute in his favor. First, it appears that Mr.
Kirby is raising the rule-of-lenity argument for the first time on appeal. Thus, it
is waived. See supra note 4 and accompanying text. In any event, “the rule of
lenity only applies if, after considering text, structure, history, and purpose, there
remains a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute, such that the Court
must simply guess as to what [the legislature] intended.” Barber v. Thomas, 130
S. Ct. 2499, 2508–09 (2010) (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks
omitted). It cannot be said in this case that there is “grievous ambiguity or
uncertainty in the statute.” Id. at 2508. Thus, this argument is unpersuasive.
      8
             As the magistrate judge explained:

             The jury was instructed that to find Kirby guilty of fraud, the
                                                                     (continued...)

                                          18
sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge, “the relevant question is whether, after

viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational

trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a

reasonable doubt.” Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979).

      The New Mexico Supreme Court reviewed this claim under the Jackson

standard and held that “a rational jury could have concluded that Collett owned

the website and its contents, and that Kirby had therefore committed fraud by

taking property that belonged to someone other than himself.” R., Vol. I, at 883.

This holding was based on evidence presented at trial, which included “the

contract between Collett and Kirby, testimony that Collett owned the computer

programming that made the web pages viewable, and testimony that Kirby

changed the password and locked Collett out of access to his copyrighted pages.”

Id. The district court, accepting the magistrate judge’s recommendation,

concluded that the state court’s “determination was a proper application of

Jackson based on the facts of this case,” and thus it was “neither contrary to nor

an unreasonable application of federal law.” Id. Reasonable jurists could not



      8
          (...continued)
                State had to prove the following three elements beyond a
                reasonable doubt: (1) Kirby intended to “deceive or cheat”
                Collett; (2) Kirby had “obtained a website”; and (3) the website
                belonged to someone other than Kirby.

R., Vol. I, at 874 (emphasis added). Mr. Kirby does not contest the sufficiency of
the evidence as to the first two enumerated elements.

                                           19
disagree with this conclusion.

      Before this court, Mr. Kirby’s only argument is that Mr. Collett testified

that “Mr. Kirby was the owner and administrator” of the website, and that the

state court “did not have the authority to usurp Collett’s testimony that Kirby

owned the website.” Aplt. Combined Br. at 19. As the district court correctly

pointed out, however, a rational jury could have found that the web pages

belonged to Mr. Collett based on the other evidence presented at trial, despite Mr.

Collett’s allegedly conflicting statement. See, e.g., McDaniel v. Brown, 130 S.

Ct. 665, 673 (2010) (“Jackson requires a reviewing court to review the evidence

in the light most favorable to the prosecution. Expressed more fully, this means a

reviewing court faced with a record of historical facts that supports conflicting

inferences must presume . . . that the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in

favor of the prosecution, and must defer to that resolution.” (citations omitted)

(internal quotation marks omitted)). Accordingly, this argument is without merit,

and Mr. Kirby is not entitled to a COA on this claim.

VII. Sufficiency of the Evidence—Value of the Website

      Mr. Kirby next contends that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate

that the website had a market value of over $250. 9 He first takes issue with the

      9
            As noted above, the state fraud statute in effect at the time Mr. Kirby
was indicted stated that “[w]hoever commits fraud when the value of the property
misappropriated or taken is over two hundred fifty dollars ($250) but not more
than twenty-five hundred dollars ($2,500) is guilty of a fourth degree felony.”
                                                                       (continued...)

                                          20
standard of review applied by the district court, which he suggests was an

“unreasonable application” of Supreme Court case law. Aplt. Combined Br. at

19. More specifically, he argues that the district court incorrectly analyzed this

claim under the Jackson framework when it “should have been resolved by asking

whether the . . . error had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in

determining the jury’s verdict.” Id. at 19–20 (quoting Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507

U.S. 619, 623 (1993)) (internal quotation marks omitted).

      It is well-established that “[t]he controlling standard for insufficient

evidence claims asserted by state habeas petitioners was established by the

Supreme Court in Jackson v. Virginia.” Johnson v. Mullin, 505 F.3d 1128, 1134

(10th Cir. 2007); accord Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. 298, 330 (1995) (stating that,

on habeas review, “the standard of Jackson v. Virginia . . . governs review of

claims of insufficient evidence”). On the other hand, the standard urged by Mr.

Kirby—articulated in Brecht v. Abrahamson—is a harmless-error standard, which

is only applied once a reviewing court has determined that a constitutional error

has been committed. See, e.g., Welch v. Workman, 639 F.3d 980, 992 (10th Cir.

2011) (en banc) (“If constitutional error is committed, we look to whether ‘the

prejudicial impact of constitutional error in [the] state-court criminal trial’ rises to



      9
       (...continued)
N.M. Stat. Ann. § 30-16-6 (1987) (emphasis added). Thus, the government was
required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that “the value of the property
misappropriated” was more than $250.

                                           21
the ‘substantial and injurious effect standard set forth in Brecht v. Abrahamson.”

(alteration in original) (emphasis added) (quoting Fry v. Pliler, 551 U.S. 112,

120, 121 n.3 (2007))). Accordingly, Mr. Kirby’s argument regarding the standard

of review is without merit.

      Next, Mr. Kirby argues that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate

that the website had a value of more than $250 because “[t]he record does not

support any reference to the value of the website [itself],” but “only deals with

suggested value to the work [done] on the web pages.” Aplt. Combined Br. at 20.

The state court rejected this argument, “not[ing] that Kirby had agreed to pay

Collett $1,890 for designing the web pages and that [a witness] testified [that] the

work Collett provided was worth $600 to $700.” R., Vol. I, at 888. The federal

district court concluded that Mr. Kirby was not entitled to habeas relief on this

claim because, “even if there were no evidence as to the value of the website

itself, a rational jury could reasonably infer that the value of the website was at

least equal to the value of the design service.” Id. Thus, the state court’s

adjudication of the matter was not contrary to nor an unreasonable application of

federal law. Reasonable jurists could not disagree with this outcome.

      Mr. Kirby does not even attempt to undermine the evidence presented

regarding the agreement to pay Mr. Collett $1890 or the witness’s $600-to-$700

valuation of the work provided by Mr. Collett. Viewing that evidence in the light

most favorable to the government, a rational jury could have concluded that the


                                          22
value of the website was more than $250. Accordingly, Mr. Kirby is not entitled

to a COA on this claim.

VIII. Fraud Predicated on Promises as to Future Events

      Mr. Kirby next argues that his conviction should be vacated because a fraud

conviction cannot be predicated on unfulfilled promises as to future events—e.g.,

future payment for website services rendered. The state appellate court found this

argument unavailing, noting that although under New Mexico law “an action for

fraud will ordinarily not lie as to a pattern of conduct based on promises that

future events will take place, . . . there are exceptions to this rule,” and that Mr.

Kirby’s actions fell within one of those exceptions recognized under state law. R,

Vol. I, at 27. In this federal habeas proceeding, the district court rejected this

claim, endorsing the magistrate judge’s conclusion that “the issue was a matter of

state law, and not reviewable on habeas.” Id. at 924. Reasonable jurists could

not disagree with this outcome.

      The Supreme Court has made clear that “it is only noncompliance with

federal law that renders a State’s criminal judgment susceptible to collateral

attack in the federal courts.” Wilson v. Corcoran, 131 S. Ct. 13, 16 (2010). “[I]t

is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine state-court

determinations on state-law questions,” id. (alteration in original) (quoting Estelle

v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67–68 (1991)) (internal quotation marks omitted); yet,

that is precisely what Mr. Kirby asked the district court to do here. He points to


                                          23
no Supreme Court case law supporting his position. Accordingly, he is not

entitled to a COA on this issue.

IX.   Mootness of Sentence-Enhancement Challenges

      Mr. Kirby next asserts that the district court erred in dismissing his

sentence-enhancement challenges—presented in his supplemental habeas pleading

(i.e., coram-nobis petition) 10—as moot. The district court determined that the

sentence-enhancement challenges were moot because Mr. Kirby had completed

his sentence and had not demonstrated any collateral consequences flowing from

the enhancement. Reasonable jurists could not disagree with the district court’s

mootness determination.



      10
              Under our case law, a district court generally “must follow certain
procedures before recharacterizing pro se pleadings as claims under §§ 2254 or
2255.” Davis v. Roberts, 425 F.3d 830, 835 (10th Cir. 2005). However, in this
case, we see no reason to disturb the district court’s reclassification. First, Mr.
Kirby does not argue that the district court was required to follow any such
procedures before recharacterizing his petition as a supplemental habeas pleading.
Additionally, the rule that courts should not sua sponte convert a pro se pleading
into a habeas petition is based “‘largely [on the] concern that a subsequent § 2255
[or § 2254] motion would be considered successive’ and barred under AEDPA
except ‘in very limited circumstances.’” United States v. Torres, 282 F.3d 1241,
1245 (10th Cir. 2002) (quoting United States v. Kelly, 235 F.3d 1238, 1241 (10th
Cir. 2000)). Thus, we have generally applied this rule “in cases where the
recharacterized petition would have been the petitioner’s first § 2255 [or § 2254]
petition,” thereby “prevent[ing] a prisoner from raising a legitimate claim in a
subsequent [habeas] petition.” Id. at 1246. In this case, however, the district
court did not transform Mr. Kirby’s coram-nobis petition into his first habeas
petition. Mr. Kirby had already filed his first § 2254 petition, and the district
court was simply supplementing the claims raised in the initial petition with those
raised in the supplemental pleading. Therefore, we will not revisit the district
court’s conclusion that this petition constituted a supplemental habeas pleading.

                                         24
      Habeas claims will become moot upon a petitioner’s release from custody

unless the petitioner establishes that “sufficient collateral consequences flow from

the underlying judgment and the completed sentence to save the appeal from

mootness.” United States v. Meyers, 200 F.3d 715, 718 (10th Cir. 2000). On

appeal, Mr. Kirby does not even attempt to defeat the mootness determination by

identifying any collateral consequences of the sentence enhancement. 11 Instead,

he argues that his sentence-enhancement challenge is actually a “challenge to the

jurisdiction of the state court to enhance [his] sentence,” which “is in fact a

challenge to the conviction, not the sentence[] therefore defeating the mootness

determination by the district court.” Aplt. Combined Br. at 25. However, by

acknowledging that he is indeed challenging “the jurisdiction of the state court to

enhance [his] sentence,” id. (emphasis added), Mr. Kirby’s argument defeats

itself; it is clear that the focus of his challenge is the sentence enhancement, not

the underlying conviction. Accordingly, because Mr. Kirby has failed to

demonstrate any collateral consequences flowing from the now-completed term of

the sentence enhancement, the district court did not err in dismissing the

challenges as moot. See Kirby v. Janecka, 379 F. App’x 781, 784 (10th Cir.



      11
              Although collateral consequences are generally presumed in the
context of a challenge to a petitioner’s conviction, that presumption has not—as
the district court noted—been applied in the context of a challenge to a sentence
enhancement, nor does Mr. Kirby argue that it should be applied in that context.
See, e.g., United States v. Hernandez-Baide, 146 F. App’x 302, 304 (10th Cir.
2005).

                                          25
2010) (holding that the petitioner’s “claim is moot because it challenges only the

state court’s enhancement of his already-completed sentence, and [he] has failed

to show any continuing collateral consequences stemming from that

enhancement”); Lucero v. McKune, 340 F. App’x 442, 444 (10th Cir. 2009)

(holding that the petitioner’s release from prison mooted his claim that his

sentences were impermissibly increased because he failed to demonstrate

collateral consequences associated with his previous incarceration). 12

X.    Evidentiary Hearing or Expansion of the Record

      In his final claim, Mr. Kirby argues that the district court erred in

“prohibiting expansion of the record to include evidence discovered and/or

provided after trial and denying an evidentiary hearing on the matter.” Aplt.

Combined Br. at 22. The sole piece of newly discovered evidence that Mr. Kirby

identifies before us in seeking a COA, 13 which he previously sought to present to


      12
             Mr. Kirby also argues that his sentence enhancement violated the
Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. However, this too is a
challenge to the state court’s authority to impose the sentence enhancement; it is
not an attack on the underlying conviction. Accordingly, Mr. Kirby’s sentence
challenge based upon the Double Jeopardy Clause is likewise moot.
      13
              Although Mr. Kirby may have sought to present additional evidence
to the district court in connection with his request to expand the record or obtain
an evidentiary hearing, he only cites to us the GTFS in arguing that the district
court erred in refusing to grant relief. Thus, he has abandoned any challenge
based on those other pieces of evidence. See, e.g., Tran v. Tr. of State Colleges in
Colorado, 355 F.3d 1263, 1266 (10th Cir. 2004) (“Issues not raised in the opening
brief are deemed abandoned or waived.” (quoting Coleman v. B-G Maint. Mgmt.
of Colo., Inc., 108 F.3d 1199, 1205 (10th Cir.1997))); cf. United States v.
                                                                       (continued...)

                                         26
the district court, was a “Good-Time-Figuring-Sheet (GTFS) that was generated

by the [New Mexico Department of Corrections] and obtained by [Mr. Kirby]

after the sentence had been enhanced,” which he argues would have supported his

“challeng[e] [to] the jurisdiction of the state court to enhance [his] sentence.” Id.

at 24. That is, this newly discovered evidence was offered to support one of the

sentence-enhancement challenges presented in his supplemental habeas pleading

(i.e., coram nobis petition). As discussed above, however, those claims are moot.

Consequently, Mr. Kirby’s challenge to the district court’s refusal to admit this

newly discovered evidence is likewise moot.

      Even if this issue were not moot, Mr. Kirby would still not be entitled to

relief. Under the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Cullen v. Pinholster, habeas

“review under § 2254(d)(1) is limited to the record that was before the state court

that adjudicated the claim on the merits.” 131 S. Ct. 1388, 1398 (2011). Mr.

Kirby’s request to expand the record or to hold an evidentiary hearing seeks to

place additional evidence before the federal district court that was not part of the

record before the state court. This is no longer permitted under Cullen. Thus,

Mr. Kirby is not entitled to an expansion of the record or an evidentiary hearing.

See Atkins v. Clarke, 642 F.3d 47, 47 (1st Cir. 2011) (“The Supreme Court’s new



      13
        (...continued)
Springfield, 337 F.3d 1175, 1178 (10th Cir. 2003) (concluding that the applicant
waived his claim on appeal “because he failed to address that claim in either his
application for a COA or his brief on appeal”).

                                          27
decision in Cullen v. Pinholster requires that we reject this appeal from a denial

of a request for an evidentiary hearing in relation to a petition for habeas corpus.”

(citation omitted)); see also Champ v. Zavaras, No. 10-1308, 2011 WL 2411002,

at *9–10 (10th Cir. June 16, 2011) (“Mr. Champ’s requests to expand the record

and to hold an evidentiary hearing to further develop the record aim to place new

evidence before the federal court that was not a part of the state-court record.

Under Cullen, this is no longer permitted.”); cf. Pape v. Thaler, 645 F.3d 281,

288 (5th Cir. 2011) (“Under [Cullen], . . . the district court erred by conducting

the evidentiary hearing and by relying on evidence from that hearing . . . . Pape’s

federal habeas petition . . . must be adjudicated under § 2254(d)(1) and Pape

‘must overcome the limitation of § 2254(d)(1) on the record that was before the

state court.’” (quoting Cullen, 131 S. Ct. at 1400)). Accordingly, we can discern

no error in the district court’s refusal to authorize the expansion of the record or

an evidentiary hearing.

                                   CONCLUSION

      For the reasons set forth above, we DENY Mr. Kirby’s request for a COA

on all claims and DISMISS his appeal.

Appeal from the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas.
Before BROWN, Chief Judge, and THORNBERRY and AINSWORTH, Circuit Judges.
THORNBERRY, Circuit Judge:


1
Computer Utilization, Inc.  (CUI), a computer service corporation based in Garland, Texas, filed a petition for an arrangement under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act on July 5, 1971.  Over one year prior to filing, CUI had retained John A. Pace, a Dallas attorney, to handle various collection matters.  It is undisputed that prior to filing, Pace had performed a considerable amount of services in the various collection matters, but had not billed CUI for those services.  Pace also performed some work after the July 5, 1971 filing, though he was somewhat vague at trial as to the nature and extent of those services.  In its Chapter XI petition, CUI did not schedule Pace either as an unsecured creditor or as a party to an executory contract.  The referee confirmed an amended plan of arrangement based upon the petition on September 16, 1971.


2
In May 1972, Pace filed suit in state district court for Dallas County, Texas to recover for his services.  On November 21, 1972, the trustee filed an application for an order to show cause why the state court proceedings should not be enjoined.  After a hearing, the referee entered a permanent injunction prohibiting Pace from pursuing his state claim and the district court below affirmed that decision.  Pace now appeals, claiming that CUI failed to satisfy the notice requirements for rejection of executory contracts, the adoption of the arrangement does not discharge his claim.  We disagree and affirm the decision below.


3
Pace and CUI executed no formal employment contract, but it is undisputed that Pace represented CUI on a continuing basis since May 1970.  He seeks recovery primarily for services rendered prior to the filing of the petition.  As to those services, Pace clearly had a provable claim at the time of filing.  The fact that Pace had not yet billed CUI is immaterial.  He had already performed the services and CUI had incurred the obligation to pay for them.  11 U.S.C. 35(a) provides '(a) discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all of his provable debts, whether allowable in full or in part . . ..'  11 U.S.C. 35(a)(3) excepts from the discharge provision those debts that 'have not been duly scheduled in time for proof and allowance, with the name of the creditor, if known to the bankrupt, unless such creditor had notice or actual knowledge of the proceedings in bankruptcy.'


4
The record testimony in the court below makes it clear that Pace cannot claim the benefit of the exception.  Pace himself testified that he had actual knowledge of the bankruptcy proceedings.  He was fully aware that the petition had been filed and that his name did not appear on the list of unsecured creditors.  Yet Pace took no action.  Under 11 U.S.C. 35(a), adoption of the arrangement discharged Pace's claim for services rendered prior to the filing of the petition.


5
As part of his claim, Pace seeks to recover for services rendered after the Chapter XI petition was filed.  Here, however, it is undisputed that Pace was not appointed to render services in accordance with General Order 44.  The claim for those services is also barred.  Becker v. Stewart, 402 F.2d 500 (5th Cir. 1968); In re HydroCarbon Chemicals, Inc., 411 F.2d 203 (3d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 823, 90 S.Ct. 66, 24 L.Ed.2d 74; 1 Collier Bankruptcy Manual P62.06 (2d Ed. 1974).


6
Pace concedes that most of the services were rendered prior to the filing of the petition, but argues that his failure to bill the bankrupt and the continuing nature of his representation made the contract executory.  He then argues that CUI failed to comply with the notice requirements for discharge of executory contracts under Chapter XI, preventing discharge of his claim.  Pace's proof of damages, however, belies these assertions.  He presented no evidence of loss of future income; instead he sought recovery for services already rendered.  The contract is not executory for purposes of the bankruptcy statute where the only performance due from the debtor is payment.  See Stell Mfg. Co. v. Gilbert, 372 F.2d 113 (5th Cir. 1962).


7
Pace worked closely with the bankrupt when CUI instituted the Chapter XI proceedings.  He was fully aware of the company's financial problems, and the status of the bankruptcy proceedings.  Yet he took no affirmative action to protect his own rights.  The district court properly denied Pace's claims for attorney's fees, and properly issued the injunction under 11 U.S.C. 35(c)(3).

       {¶ 1} Timothy H. Housley appeals from the trial court’s denial of his “motion to

vacate a void judgment of conviction for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.” For the

following reasons, the trial court’s judgment will be affirmed.

       {¶ 2} In October 2016, Housley pled guilty in the Miami County Court of Common

Pleas to trafficking in drugs, a second-degree felony, and two counts of possession of

drugs, both third-degree felonies. The parties agreed to a five-year sentence, and the

State agreed to take no position on judicial release.        At sentencing, the trial court

imposed five years for Count 1 and 12-month sentences for Counts 2 and 3, to be served

concurrently. The court further ordered Housley to pay restitution of $125 and court

costs, and it suspended his driver’s license for two years. Housley did not appeal his

conviction.

       {¶ 3} In July 2017, Housley sought judicial release, which was denied.

       {¶ 4} In December 2017, the State filed an application for the destruction or

disposal of evidence seized from Housley by the Troy Police Department, including cell

phones, computers, currency, and a handgun. The court granted the motion. Housley

subsequently sought the return of additional property seized by the police, including a

safe. The trial court denied Housley’s motion for lack of jurisdiction. Housley appealed

the trial court’s ruling. See State v. Housley, 2d Dist. Miami No. 2018-CA-4, 2018-Ohio-

4140. The outcomes of Housley’s 2018 appeal and a subsequent appeal related to

Housley’s motion for return of property are not relevant to this appeal.

       {¶ 5} On December 14, 2017, Housley moved to withdraw his guilty plea due to

ineffective assistance of trial counsel. He claimed that he declined to pursue his motion
                                                                                         -3-


to suppress and accepted a five-year plea offer because defense counsel indicated that

he would receive 16 years in prison if he did not accept the offer. Housley argued in his

motion that his counsel acted deficiently by “coercing and allowing [him] to plead guilty”

because (1) he was illegally detained by the Troy Police Department, which would have

been raised at the scheduled suppression hearing, (2) the charges in the information were

void, (3) he did not help prepare, ship or traffic hashish, liquid hashish and/or marijuana,

(4) the State lacked probable cause to arrest him on the charges to which he pled, and

(5) defense counsel did not inform Housley that the drugs could be reanalyzed. Housley

asserted that counsel did not provide him complete discovery and that he (Housley) was

innocent of the charges. Housley also argued that the State violated the plea agreement

when it objected to Housley’s motion for judicial release.1

       {¶ 6} In April 2018, the trial court denied Housley’s motion to withdraw his plea.

Housley did not appeal the trial court’s ruling.

       {¶ 7} On March 7, 2019, Housley filed a “motion to vacate a void judgment of

conviction for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.” Housley emphasized that the State

acknowledged in its appellate brief in Case No. 2018-CA-4 that Housley was a visitor at

the home that was searched and where drugs were found that brought about the charges

in this case (2016-CR-348). Housley argued that the information was exculpatory, that

the State had violated its duty under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10

L.Ed.2d 215 (1963) to disclose it, and that the State’s actions divested the trial court of


1 The State’s response to Housley’s motion for judicial release was filed after the trial
court denied Housley’s motion. Shortly after the filing of Housley’s motion to withdraw
his plea, the State withdrew its response to Housley’s motion for judicial release and
indicated that the State had no position on any future motion for judicial release filed by
Housley.
                                                                                           -4-


subject matter jurisdiction. Housley attached to his motion the relevant page from the

State’s appellate brief, which stated that Housley had claimed that he did not reside at

the residence and that Housley had not established ownership and possession of the safe

and computers at issue.

       {¶ 8} The State opposed Housley’s motion to vacate, construing the motion as a

petition for postconviction relief. The State asserted that it fully complied with Brady, that

Housley’s petition was untimely, and that his claim of newly exculpatory evidence was

“blatantly false.” Housley filed a reply memorandum, disclaiming that he had filed a

petition for postconviction relief or a Civ.R. 60(B) motion. He again asserted that the

State’s Brady and discovery violation was a jurisdictional defect.

       {¶ 9} The trial court denied Housley’s motion, concluding that it had subject matter

jurisdiction over Housley’s criminal case for drug trafficking and possession of drugs.

The court noted that the “primary issue raised by Defendant is that his constitutional rights

were violated by the State because he was a mere visitor in the house of the co-

defendant, and the State withheld this exculpatory information from him.” The court

found that Housley’s claim fell with R.C. 2953.21, governing petitions for postconviction

relief, although Housley insisted that he was not seeking relief under that statute. The

court concluded that such a claim would be untimely and that Housley’s being a visitor to

the house was not exculpatory as residency was not an element of the charges to which

he pled guilty.

       {¶ 10} Housley appeals from the trial court’s ruling, raising arguments similar to

those in his motion to vacate.

       {¶ 11} As an initial matter, we find no error with the trial court’s conclusion that it
                                                                                           -5-


had subject matter jurisdiction over Housley’s criminal case. “Subject-matter jurisdiction

is the power of a court to entertain and adjudicate a particular class of cases.” Bank of

Am., N.A. v. Kuchta, 141 Ohio St.3d 75, 2014-Ohio-4275, 21 N.E.3d 1040, ¶ 19, citing

Morrison v. Steiner, 32 Ohio St.2d 86, 87, 290 N.E.2d 841 (1972).            Common pleas

courts are constitutionally created and are courts of general jurisdiction with subject

matter jurisdiction over all legal and equitable matters that are not denied to the court. Id.

at ¶ 20; see Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section 4(B).

       {¶ 12} Pursuant to R.C. 2931.03, a court of common pleas “has original jurisdiction

of all crimes and offenses, except in the case of minor offenses * * *.” See, e.g., State

ex rel. Kerr v. Pollex, Ohio Slip Opinion No. 2020-Ohio-411, __ N.E.3d __, ¶ 7 (common

pleas court had subject matter jurisdiction, pursuant to R.C. 2931.03, over defendant’s

criminal case for forgery and tampering with evidence); Smith v. Sheldon, 157 Ohio St.3d

1, 2019-Ohio-1677, 131 N.E.3d 1, ¶ 8 (common pleas court has subject matter jurisdiction

over felony cases).

       {¶ 13} Housley originally was indicted on two counts of trafficking in drugs, illegal

manufacture of drugs, and two counts of possession of drugs, all felonies.                He

subsequently pled guilty to amended charges of trafficking in drugs and two counts of

possession, as charged by information. All of the charges fell within the subject matter

jurisdiction of the Miami County Court of Common Pleas.

       {¶ 14} In general, where a trial court “erred in the exercise of its jurisdiction” but

“did not act without jurisdiction,” the resulting judgment is voidable rather than void.

Dunbar v. State, 136 Ohio St.3d 181, 2013-Ohio-2163, 992 N.E.2d 1111, ¶ 15. Housley

asserts that the judgment in his case is void due to the actions of the State, specifically
                                                                                           -6-


the prosecution’s failure to disclose all required evidence and the police’s allegedly

unlawful behavior in detaining him and interviewing him.               While, under some

circumstances, the actions of the State may subject a conviction to collateral attack in a

postconviction proceeding, the State’s alleged conduct in this case did not deprive the

trial court of subject matter jurisdiction.

       {¶ 15} Housley further claims that the trial court should not have reviewed his

motion as a petition for postconviction relief, as he did not seek relief under R.C. 2953.21

or Civ.R. 60(B). The nature of a motion is not necessarily governed by its title. When a

motion is filed subsequent to a direct appeal (or the expiration of time for filing a direct

appeal), claims the denial of constitutional rights, seeks to render the judgment of

conviction void, and asks for vacation of the judgment and sentence, the motion is

properly construed as a petition for postconviction relief. See, e.g., State v. Reynolds,

79 Ohio St.3d 158, 160, 679 N.E.2d 1131 (1997); State v. Cline, 2d Dist. Champaign No.

2013 CA 51, 2014-Ohio-4503, ¶ 7. Housley’s motion, although titled as a motion to

vacate a void judgment, met the criteria for a petition for postconviction relief. The trial

court did not err in construing his motion as such.

       {¶ 16} Pursuant to R.C. 2953.21(A)(2), Housley was required to file a petition for

postconviction relief “no later than three hundred sixty-five days after the expiration of the

time for filing the [direct] appeal.” Housley was convicted on November 30, 2016, and

he did not appeal. He therefore was required to file his petition for postconviction relief

by December 30, 2017, absent an excuse for his untimeliness under R.C. 2953.23.

Housley filed his motion to vacate on March 7, 2019, well beyond the deadline for filing a

petition for postconviction relief.
                                                                                        -7-


       {¶ 17} Housley asserts, albeit under a Brady argument, that he recently learned

that the State knew him to be a visitor to the residence where drugs were found.

However, whether Housley was a visitor or, instead, a resident of the home was within

Housley’s knowledge at the time of his conviction. Such information was not newly

discovered. Accordingly, Housley has not provided a basis to excuse the untimeliness

of his petition/motion.

       {¶ 18} Moreover, even if we were to consider Housley’s argument that the State

withheld discovery and Brady material when it allegedly failed to inform him that it knew

that he was a visitor, we would find no merit to Housley’s claim.

       {¶ 19} Brady held that “the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable

to an accused upon request violates due process when the evidence is material either to

guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.”

Disciplinary Counsel v. Kellogg-Martin, 124 Ohio St.3d 415, 2010-Ohio-282, 923 N.E.2d

125, ¶ 24, citing Brady at 87. In order to establish a Brady violation, the defendant must

demonstrate that (1) the prosecution failed to disclose evidence upon request; (2) the

evidence was favorable to the defendant; and (3) the evidence was material. State v.

Wade, 2d Dist. Clark No. 06-CA-108, 2007-Ohio-6611, ¶ 12. Evidence suppressed by

the State “shall be deemed material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the

evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been

different.” State v. Aldridge, 120 Ohio App.3d 122, 145, 697 N.E.2d 228 (2d Dist.1997),

quoting State v. Johnston, 39 Ohio St.3d 48, 529 N.E.2d 898 (1988), paragraph five of

the syllabus.

       {¶ 20} “The rule in Brady only applies to evidence unknown to the defendant at the
                                                                                      -8-


time of the trial.” State v. Royster, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26378, 2015-Ohio-625, ¶ 17.

       {¶ 21} Here, Housley has not demonstrated a Brady or discovery violation by the

State. The page of the State’s appellate brief upon which Housley relies simply noted

that Housley had argued that he was a visitor at the residence; the State did not concede

that he was a visitor or cite to evidence establishing where Housley lived. And, Housley

has not identified any evidence that was withheld by the State, either related to his

residency or otherwise. Moreover, as stated above, whether Housley was or was not a

visitor, rather than a resident, was within Housley’s knowledge at the time of his arrest

and throughout his case. Accordingly, even considering Housley’s motion on the merits,

Housley has not demonstrated that a Brady or discovery violation occurred to warrant the

vacation of his conviction.

       {¶ 22} The trial court’s judgment will be affirmed.

                        UNITED STATES TAX COURT



              HOWARD & REBECCA PATE, Petitioner v.
          COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, Respondent



     Docket No. 10006-07.                Filed December 9, 2008.



     Howard and Rebecca Pate, pro sese.

     Randall Durfee and Gordon Sanz, for respondent.



                MEMORANDUM FINDINGS OF FACT AND OPINION


     COHEN, Judge:     Respondent determined deficiencies of $16,339

and $19,409 in petitioners’ Federal income taxes for 2003 and

2004, respectively.    Respondent also determined penalties under

section 6662(a) of $3,267.80 and $3,881.80 for 2003 and 2004,

respectively.    The issues for decision are:     (1) Whether the Pate

Association and Pate Joint Venture are disregarded for Federal
                               - 2 -

tax purposes and their income for the years in issue is

attributed to petitioners; (2) whether petitioners are liable for

self-employment tax; (3) whether petitioners are entitled to any

deductions beyond those conceded by respondent; and (4) whether

petitioners are liable for the penalties under section 6662(a).

Unless otherwise indicated, all section references are to the

Internal Revenue Code in effect for the years in issue, and all

Rule references are to the Tax Court Rules of Practice and

Procedure.

                         FINDINGS OF FACT

     Petitioners resided in Texas at the time that they filed

their petition.   During 2003 and 2004, petitioner Howard W. Pate

(Mr. Pate) conducted a business as a pipeline inspector and

consultant.   Mr. Pate worked exclusively for Anadarko Petroleum

Corp. or its affiliate, Anadarko Gathering Co. (Anadarko).

Anadarko reported nonemployee compensation on Forms 1099-MISC,

Miscellaneous Income, that it issued to Mr. Pate for those years.

The amounts received by Mr. Pate and reported as nonemployee

compensation were $98,200 for 2003 and $107,065 for 2004.

     During 2003 and 2004, Rebecca Pate (Ms. Pate) was employed

full time as a school teacher for the Bryan Independent School

District in Bryan, Texas.   Petitioners had two young children

living at home during the years in issue.
                                - 3 -

     Petitioners owned approximately 52 acres of land in Bryan,

Texas.    By the end of 2004, petitioners maintained no more than

30 cows on the property.    They did not sell any cows or calves

during 2003 or 2004.    Petitioners did not maintain books and

records of their cattle activity or any record showing profit and

loss from that activity.    Mr. Pate was away from home on business

much of the time, leaving Ms. Pate and their children to feed the

cattle.    Petitioners’ cattle activity was not conducted in a

businesslike manner and was not operated with an actual and

honest profit objective.

     Petitioners filed Forms 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax

Return, for 2003 and 2004.    The amounts paid to Mr. Pate in

relation to his business, $98,200 for 2003 and $107,065 for 2004,

were initially set out as gross income on Schedules C, Profit or

Loss From Business.    Petitioners, however, reduced these gross

income amounts to zero by claiming “other expenses” of equal

amounts.    Petitioners supposedly validated these Schedule C

expenses by noting that the business was “pass thru” and a “Form

1099 issued to above taxpayer ID# are properly reported” for 2003

“on Schedule E, page 2. Joint Venture” and for 2004 “on Form

1120 S”.    The gross income set out on each Schedule C was

therefore not included in the computation of taxable income.

     The 2003 Schedule E, Supplemental Income and Loss, reflected

a much smaller amount of income, $49,820, than that set out on
                               - 4 -

Schedule C, $98,200.   Petitioners reported that this income had

been earned by the “Pate Joint Venture”.   Petitioners filed the

2004 Form 1120S, U.S. Income Tax Return for an S Corporation, for

a so-called Pate Association that used the same address as

petitioners’ residence.   The Form 1120S reported gross receipts

of $107,289, claimed cost of goods sold of $15,594 and business

deductions of $63,959, and reported net business income of

$27,736.

     The Pate Association and Pate Joint Venture were concepts

that, in Mr. Pate’s words, “put all of our stuff under one and so

we could file everything as one to make it easy for us to file

our income tax.”   Mr. Pate did not know whether the Pate

Association and Pate Joint Venture were one and the same or two

separate entities.   These two concepts, which had no purpose

other than to reduce petitioners’ Federal income taxes, had been

suggested by Richard Ohendalski, a certified public accountant

(C.P.A.) associated with the Legacy Group.   Employees of the

Legacy Group prepared petitioners’ income tax returns for 2003

and 2004.

     As a result of the manner in which their Federal income tax

returns for 2003 and 2004 were prepared, petitioners failed to

report self-employment tax due on Mr. Pate’s business profit.    In

addition, deductions claimed as business deductions included

personal expenses and other nondeductible items.   The amounts and
                                 - 5 -

the nature of the specific items claimed were not disclosed on

petitioners’ returns.

     During an audit of their Federal income tax returns for 2003

and 2004, petitioners presented various receipts and schedules to

support deductible business expenses.     Only the following amounts

were substantiated to the satisfaction of respondent:

      Year                 Description                 Amount

      2003              Repairs                          $309
                        Utilities and phone             1,809
                        Automobile                     18,948
                        Dues & fees                       216
                        Legal/accounting                  425

      2004              Automobile                     21,890
                        Telephone                         904

                                OPINION

     A taxpayer has the right to elect a business form to

minimize or altogether avoid the incidence of taxation by any

means that the law permits.     See Gregory v. Helvering, 293 U.S.

465, 469 (1935).   While a taxpayer is free to adopt a corporate

or partnership form of doing business, the entity must have been

organized for a substantial business purpose or actually engage

in substantive income-producing activity in order to be

recognized as a separate taxable entity.      See Commissioner v.

Culbertson, 337 U.S. 733, 743 (1949); Moline Props., Inc. v.

Commissioner, 319 U.S. 436, 439 (1943).       The Government, however,

is not required to simply accept a taxpayer’s election of

business form where that form is unreal.       Higgins v. Smith, 308
                               - 6 -

U.S. 473, 477 (1940).   Instead, the Government should disregard

such an entity, as any other result would allow the schemes of

the taxpayer to supersede the law.     Id.

     Mr. Pate testified and petitioners do not deny that they

adopted their tax-reporting methodology solely for tax reasons.

The so-called Pate Association and Pate Joint Venture had no

business purpose.   They merely supported a methodology designed

to avoid reporting and paying Federal income tax and self-

employment tax on Mr. Pate’s earnings during the years in issue

and to allow the amounts and the nature of particular expenses to

be concealed.   Petitioners could not provide credible evidence

that the Pate Association and Pate Joint Venture were viable

entities separate from petitioners for Federal tax purposes.

Because these “entities” have no economic substance and separate

legal existence, the income in issue is attributed to petitioners

and subject to Federal income tax.

     With respect to their liability for self-employment taxes,

petitioners’ brief asserts the following frivolous position:

     Self-employment tax
          In the notice of deficiency respondent seeks to
     assert self-employment tax. Self-employment taxes are
     imposed only upon the operations of a “trade or
     business”. “Trade or business” is defined in the
     Internal Revenue Code as “...the performance of the
     functions of a public office.” See IRC 7701(a)(26).
     Self-employment tax also depends upon the definition of
     “trade or business” as in IRC 162. IRC section 162
     makes no changes to the code wide definition in section
     7701 as applies to petitioner.
                                - 7 -

Section 7701(a)(26) provides that, for purposes of the Internal

Revenue Code, “The term `trade or business’ includes the

performance of the functions of a public office.”     Frivolous

arguments based on converting the term “includes” in a section of

title 26 to “includes only” have been soundly rejected.      See

United States v. Ward, 833 F.2d 1538, 1539 (11th Cir. 1987);

United States v. Latham, 754 F.2d 747, 750 (7th Cir. 1985).

Petitioners’ argument is patently fallacious and deserves no

further consideration.    See Crain v. Commissioner, 737 F.2d 1417

(5th Cir. 1984).    Petitioners are liable for self-employment tax

on the net income of Mr. Pate’s business as a pipeline inspector

and consultant.    See generally secs. 1401(a), 1402(b); sec.

1.1402(a)-1, Income Tax Regs.

     Although copies of various receipts and schedules were

marked as exhibits at trial, petitioners did not provide any

testimony or otherwise explain the amounts claimed as deductions

that were not substantiated to the satisfaction of respondent.

Respondent did not stipulate that the exhibits established that

petitioners incurred expenses in the conduct of the trade or

business or with the intention of making a profit or that they

reflected ordinary and necessary business expenses.    The

documents are not self-proving and, to the extent that they are

legible, include many items that are not deductible.    They are

not reliable evidence of deductibility.   It is impossible to tell
                                - 8 -

from the record which items supported the deductions respondent

agreed to.

     The parties dispute whether petitioners’ cattle activity was

engaged in for profit and whether expenses related to it would be

deductible under section 162.    Petitioners’ brief makes several

factual arguments that are not supported by the evidence.      The

limited evidence in the record is to the effect that petitioners

did not conduct the activity in a manner demonstrating an actual

and honest profit objective.    See sec. 1.183-2(a), Income Tax

Regs.   We need not conduct a detailed analysis of the factors,

however, because petitioners have not identified or explained on

their tax returns or during their testimony the items in dispute

that they claim related to the cattle activity.    Petitioners have

not presented any testimony or evidence that they are entitled to

deductions beyond those respondent conceded, and they have failed

to satisfy their burden of proving that they are entitled to

deductions.   See sec. 7491(a)(2); INDOPCO, Inc. v. Commissioner,

503 U.S. 79, 84 (1992); Hradesky v. Commissioner, 65 T.C. 87

(1975), affd. per curiam 540 F.2d 821 (5th Cir. 1976).

     Section 6662(a) provides a penalty in an amount equal to 20

percent of the portion of an underpayment which is attributable

to various factors, including negligence, disregard of rules or

regulations, or any substantial understatement of income tax.

See sec. 6662(b)(1) and (2).    Respondent has the burden of
                                - 9 -

production with respect to any penalty.     See sec. 7491(c).    The

evidence produced establishes erroneous tax return reporting and

improper deductions resulting in a substantial understatement of

income tax.

     Although petitioners claim to have relied upon the advice of

a C.P.A. in adopting their filing methodology, they did not

present evidence of what information they gave the return

preparers or what advice the accountant gave them before filing

the returns for the years in issue.     See Neonatology Associates,

P.A. v. Commissioner, 115 T.C. 43, 100 (2000), affd. 299 F.3d 221

(3d Cir. 2002).    They have failed to identify any reasonable

basis for the methodology or any other ground for reducing the

understatement of tax subject to the penalty.    See sec.

6662(d)(2)(B).    The penalties are appropriate and will be

sustained.

     We have considered the other arguments of the parties, and

they are either without merit or need not be addressed in view of

our resolution of the issues.

     To reflect respondent’s concessions,


                                           Decision will be entered

                                      under Rule 155.

576 So.2d 666 (1991)
Jimmy R. HASTINGS
v.
Bobby HANCOCK d/b/a B & P Used Motors.
Civ. 7845.
Court of Civil Appeals of Alabama.
February 6, 1991.
*667 Clyde D. Baker, Guntersville, for appellant.
No brief for appellee.
ROBERTSON, Presiding Judge.
Following a hearing in which the employee, Jimmy Hastings, was awarded workmen's compensation benefits, he moved for an amended judgment, requesting double compensation pursuant to § 25-5-8(e), Code 1975.
That code section provides:
"Penalties for failure to secure payment of compensation; injunctions.  Any employer required to secure ... compensation shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be subject to a fine of not less than $25 nor more than $1,000. In addition thereto, any employer required to secure the payment of compensation under this section who fails to secure such compensation shall be liable for two times the amount of compensation which would have otherwise been payable for injury or death to an employee."
§ 25-5-8(e), Code 1975 (emphasis added).
The trial court's order in this case that awarded the employee benefits made no finding concerning whether the employer had failed to secure workmen's compensation insurance. However, upon the employee's motion to amend the final judgment, the court entered the following order:
"The claim for the penalty under the aforesaid code section [§ 25-5-8(e)] was not made a part of the plaintiff's complaint and was not litigated on trial of this cause. Further, there is no evidence before the court of whether the defendants have opted to be self-insurers, under sub-paragraph (b) of the aforesaid code section, as they have the right to do."
This court has previously determined that the double award penalty provision of § 25-5-8(e), Code 1975, is mandatory. Rush v. Heflin, 411 So.2d 1295 (Ala.Civ. App.1982). In fact, this court specifically noted in Rush that "there is no legal right to relief from a penalty which is required to be imposed by law." Further, because the code section was found to be valid, this court held that "it had to be applied by the trial court." Rush at 1296.
However, the trial court in this case refused to impose the penalty for two reasons. First, the trial court determined that no claim for the penalty was made as a part of the employee's complaint and that the issue was not litigated. Second, the trial court found that no evidence was presented concerning whether the employer had elected to be a self-insurer. (Such an election, if proven, would have removed the employer from the application of the penalty provision. § 25-5-8(b), Code 1975.)
Concerning the trial court's finding that no claim for the penalty was made or litigated, we note the following. The employee's complaint requested such benefits as he was entitled to pursuant to the workmen's compensation laws of Alabama. Further, the court is bound to grant whatever relief is appropriate in a case based on *668 the facts proved, regardless of whether the complaint specifically demanded such relief. Rule 54(c), A.R.Civ.P.; Johnson v. City of Mobile, 475 So.2d 517 (Ala.1985).
The following testimony was given by Pat Hancock, the employer's wife, who worked as a clerical employee of the employer:
"MR. BAKER: When Mr. Hastings was hurt, you went to the hospital in Fort Payne and guaranteed his hospital bill, did you not?
"MRS. HANCOCK: Yes, sir.
"MR. BAKER: Did you tell them it was workmen's compensation?
"MRS. HANCOCK: No, sir, because we didn't have workmen's comp.
"MR. BAKER: You did not have any workmen's comp. coverage at the time of this injury?
"MRS. HANCOCK: No, sir."
". . .
"MR. MCGEE (employer's lawyer): Did you, in fact, make arrangements at the hospital for the medical bills?
"MRS. HANCOCK: Yes, sir.
". . .
"MR. MCGEE: Why did you do that?
"MRS. HANCOCK: Well, I knew he had gotten hurt on our property and I just figured that it was because he had got hurt on our property, it was our responsibility."
From this testimony, we find that the employee proved such facts as would entitle him to recover the double penalty, regardless of the fact that the employee failed to specifically request this relief in his complaint. Johnson. In short, because the employer had no workmen's compensation insurance as required by law, the penalty was due to be imposed. Rush.
However, we must now examine whether the trial court's second legal conclusion correctly prevented the employee from recovering the double benefits penalty.
We recognize that the provisions of § 25-5-8 do not set out who has the burden of establishing whether an employer is self insured, and, further, we note that this issue has not been previously addressed by the appellate courts of this state. However, because proof of self-insurance would prevent an employer from having to pay the double penalty provision, we find that establishing such proof should properly be the employer's burden.
In Mobile Liners, Inc. v. McConnell, 220 Ala. 562, 126 So. 626 (1930), our supreme court was confronted with the question of who had the burden of proof with regard to establishing the number of employees regularly employed by an employer. In that situation, the court noted that because the code section concerning the number of employees operated to remove the employer from having to comply with workmen's compensation laws, "the burden is upon the employer to bring itself within the terms of that exception." Mobile Liners, 220 Ala. at 566, 126 So. at 629 (citation omitted). Similarly, proof of self-insurance in this case would remove the employer from having to comply with the workmen's compensation laws, and we find that "the burden is upon the employer to bring itself within the terms of that exception." Mobile Liners.
Our examination of the record discloses that the employer in this case failed to offer any evidence tending to establish that he was self-insured. In fact, all of the testimony previously referred to indicates just the opposite. Likewise, we note that at the outset of the case, the employer contended he was not subject to the requirements of the workmen's compensation act because he did not have enough employees; however, the court found otherwise. The employer made no contention that he was exempt from the workmen's compensation laws due to his having been authorized by the director of industrial relations to operate as a self-insurer.
Consequently, we find that the trial court erred in not applying the mandatory penalty provision of § 25-5-8(e). This case is reversed and remanded with directions that the trial court enter a judgment consistent with this opinion.

OPINION
HARBISON, Justice.
Appellant was convicted of murder in the first degree and sentenced to death by electrocution. We affirm the judgment and the sentence.
In the late afternoon of April 21, 1982, appellant twice shot and killed 71-year-old Walter Allen while attempting to rob him. Appellant was at that time not quite 23 years of age. He and two other youths had been "cruising" in an automobile belonging to appellant's aunt after having taken appellant's sister to a bus stop. Thereafter they saw the victim walking along the street near his home, carrying a sack of groceries, as he did almost daily. Appellant was armed and decided to rob the victim, who was previously unknown to any of the three youths and who had not offered them any provocation whatever. Leaving his aunt's parked automobile, which was being driven by one of his cousins, appellant accosted the victim and demanded his money. The victim apparently resisted and sought to grapple with appellant or to apprehend him. Appellant shot the victim twice, either of the wounds being sufficient to cause death. Mr. Allen died a little over four hours later. Appellant did not pause to render aid, but fled, leaving his elderly victim lying helpless and bleeding on the sidewalk. Appellant returned to the automobile as did the only one of his companions who had left it. The other had remained in the driver's seat. The three were seen leaving the area at a high speed. A witness was able to furnish some description of appellant and the 15-year-old companion who had stepped out of the automobile with him. She was also able partially to describe the numbering on *957 the license plate. The automobile was discovered by police the next day and identified as belonging to appellant's aunt.
It was not until November, some seven months later, in connection with an unrelated criminal incident, that police received definite information that appellant had been involved in the murder of Mr. Allen. According to testimony at a suppression hearing, one of appellant's cousins who was in custody called appellant from the police station and was assured by appellant that he, not the cousin, was responsible for the homicide. The police contacted appellant a few days later. When he returned their telephone call they took him into custody. He later gave a statement admitting that he shot and killed Mr. Allen but contending that the shooting was accidental, rather than intentional.
The 15-year-old companion of appellant, Darrell Lipscomb (also known as Chuck Williams) testified at the trial. In his confession appellant stated that Lipscomb suggested the robbery and was with him when it was attempted. He later indicated to another relative that Lipscomb could have prevented the shooting but did not do so. Lipscomb, however, testified that the attempted robbery was appellant's own idea. He also testified that he had left the automobile after appellant, and that appellant accosted Mr. Allen some distance away. Lipscomb denied being present at the shooting, but testified that he heard two shots. He said that appellant then came running back to the automobile, and the three youths sped away. He stated that appellant told him that the victim had "tussled" with appellant and that appellant had then shot him twice. Appellant was taller than Lipscomb and his hair style matched the description given by the witness, Mrs. Settle, who saw the youths running from the area where Mr. Allen had fallen.
Appellant did not testify at the trial or at the sentencing hearing, other than to take the stand in a jury-out hearing to confirm that he had been advised of his legal rights. In addition to admitting to Lipscomb and to the police that he had shot Mr. Allen, he also admitted doing so to his aunt, Mrs. Ella Mae McClain, who visited him at the jail. Although there were discrepancies between the testimony of Lipscomb and appellant's statement, and although strenuous efforts were made to impeach Mrs. McClain, these were issues which were submitted to and resolved by the jury. There is abundant material evidence in the record to support their verdict, and appellant's attack upon the sufficiency of the convicting evidence is without merit.
Similarly without substance is the contention of appellant that the State's evidence fails to show premeditation and malice. Murder in the first degree is defined in T.C.A. § 39-2-202(a) as premeditated, willful, deliberate and malicious homicide, but it is also defined as including any murder committed in the perpetration of certain specified felonies, including robbery. Murder in the first degree is sufficiently shown by proof of a killing committed during one of these specified felonies. State v. Johnson, 661 S.W.2d 854, 860-861 (Tenn. 1983); Tosh v. State, 527 S.W.2d 146, 148 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1975). In this and in other cases it has been suggested that a change in the wording of the first degree murder statutes from "killing" to "murder" by 1977 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 51, § 1, had the effect of abolishing the felony-murder rule. We do not so construe the statute and did not do so in Johnson, supra, in which the homicide occurred in 1980.
Appellant attacks the admissibility of his confession upon the ground that it was not voluntarily given. The trial judge, however, held a full pre-trial suppression hearing and resolved the factual issues against appellant. The record fully supports his conclusion that appellant was clearly advised of his legal rights with respect to the statement, and that the statement was voluntarily given. As previously *958 indicated, appellant had already seriously incriminated himself in a telephone conversation, monitored by the police, in which he advised his cousin that he was responsible for Mr. Allen's death and would so inform the police.
At the time the investigation in this case was initiated, immediately after the shooting, the victim had not died. Initial police documents indicated that an aggravated assault had occurred, and the caption to appellant's statement contains the words "aggravated assault" rather than referring to a homicide. The context of the questioning itself, however, made it clear that the death of Mr. Allen was being investigated. We find no merit to the contention of appellant that he was in any way misled as to the nature of the potential charges against him. In his conversation with his cousin he had admitted knowing that Mr. Allen had died, and his contention that his formal statement was involuntary because of insufficient information as to the charges is entirely unpersuasive. Likewise we find no merit whatever to the suggestion made in appellant's brief that he lacked sufficient mental capacity to know or understand the statement made or the nature of the charges.
In his brief counsel for appellant attacks the constitutionality of the death penalty in general and of the Tennessee statute authorizing its imposition, on eleven separate grounds. None of these has been briefed or argued, but each of them has previously been considered in detail in reported decisions of this Court. We therefore see no need to examine these assignments in detail but will briefly mention some of them.
Appellant insists that the statute is deficient in not requiring notice of the aggravating circumstances to be relied upon by the State. This contention was rejected in Houston v. State, 593 S.W.2d 267 (Tenn. 1980), but, in any event, in the present case notice was given of the principal aggravating circumstance relied upon. Further, Rule 12.3(b) of the Tennessee Rules of Criminal Procedure has been amended to require such notice for trials occurring after August 22, 1984. The present trial occurred before that date. Since notice was actually given, however, and since it was not constitutionally required, we find this issue to be without merit. Also without merit is the contention that the statutes create two separate offenses so as to pose a double jeopardy problem. This issue was considered and rejected in the Houston case, and in State v. Austin, 618 S.W.2d 738, 742 (Tenn. 1981).
Each of the other contentions advanced by appellant has been carefully examined in reported decisions of the Court, and we see no need to repeat those discussions here. Appellant has advanced a five-part challenge to the felony-murder rule in cases involving murder in the first degree. These contentions were considered in State v. Sheffield, 676 S.W.2d 542, 551 (Tenn. 1984), where identical arguments were considered and rejected. Many of the contentions advanced by appellant in connection with the constitutional issue are not even relevant to this case, such as the validity of some of the aggravating circumstances or the responsibility of an aider or abettor.
Appellant has assigned as error the failure of the trial judge to permit individual examination of prospective jurors. There is no contention made in this case that any reversible error occurred during the lengthy jury examination. Further the trial judge indicated that he would grant individual examination if necessary, and some individual questioning was in fact permitted. This matter lay within the discretion of the trial judge, and we find no abuse of that discretion. See State v. Workman, 667 S.W.2d 44, 49 (Tenn. 1984).
In two assignments of error counsel for appellant contends that reversible error occurred during closing argument at the guilt stage of the trial when one of the prosecuting attorneys undertook to remove *959 a book from counsel table and to refer to it. The book had reference to techniques in creating a reasonable doubt in the defense of criminal trials. The trial judge sustained a portion of the objections of defense counsel, and the remaining argument of the prosecutor was clearly directed toward rebuttal of the contention of counsel for appellant that reasonable doubt had been created in this case. Indeed the principal thrust of the closing argument of counsel for the defendant was insufficiency of evidence and reasonable doubt in a number of respects, and the prosecutor was clearly entitled to respond to these contentions. In our opinion, taken in context, nothing which occurred in connection with this incident could possibly have affected the results of the trial.
In his final issue on appeal, counsel for appellant urges that the trial court committed reversible error in charging one of the statutory aggravating circumstances pertaining to an escape or an attempt to escape from lawful arrest or prosecution.
The State had not insisted upon this circumstance, but at the conclusion of all of the evidence, the trial judge felt that this issue was raised by the evidence sufficiently to warrant an instruction. Whether or not the trial judge was correct in this regard, the jury did not find that the appellant had committed the homicide under circumstances falling within the parameter of that statute. Accordingly it did not impose the death penalty under that aggravating circumstance or find that appellant was guilty thereof. The issue is therefore probably moot.
The trial judge objected significantly to the procedure outlined by this Court in previous decisions,[1] requiring the trial judge to charge the jury only on those aggravating and mitigating circumstances fairly raised by the evidence. He felt that a different procedure was preferable, but finally did undertake to emphasize those which the parties contended were applicable or which the court felt had been fairly raised.
There was evidence contained both in appellant's signed statement and in the testimony that the victim of the homicide in the present case, Mr. Allen, had resisted appellant's attempt to rob him and had "tussled" with him. Indeed it was the primary insistence of appellant that the shooting was accidental and was the result of this struggle.
It is basic statutory law in this state that a private person may arrest another for an offense committed in the presence of the arresting individual, or for a felony not committed in his presence. A private person may also arrest when a felony has been committed and he only has reasonable cause to believe that the arrested person committed it. See T.C.A. §§ 40-7-109(a)(1), (2), (3). A private person may even break into the dwelling house of an individual who has committed a felony after giving proper notice of his intention to make the arrest. T.C.A. § 40-7-112.
While the evidence in this case was brief, there was proof from which a trier of fact might have found that Mr. Allen did attempt to confine or apprehend his assailant. The charge given, therefore, was not without foundation in the record, and reversible error was not committed in permitting the jury to consider it. Since the jurors did not base their sentence on this circumstance, however, we need not consider the preponderance or weight of the evidence on the point.
The only aggravating circumstance found by the jurors, and the one on which the death penalty was based, was that the appellant committed the murder while engaging or attempting to engage in a robbery. T.C.A. § 39-2-203(i)(7). The evidence overwhelmingly establishes the guilt of appellant in this respect. In State *960 v. Prichett, 621 S.W.2d 127, 140-141 (Tenn. 1981), the Court held that the death penalty could properly be imposed under this aggravating circumstance even though "the felony of robbery may have been used by the jury to establish that the murder was murder in the first degree... ." We adhere to that holding, and are of the opinion that the "underlying felony" may be used as an aggravating circumstance at the sentencing phase of the trial.
In this case there is hardly any suggestion of mitigating factors which could possibly outweigh the outrageous and totally antisocial behavior of the accused in committing this shocking homicide. The jurors were certainly not obligated to accept appellant's contention that the shooting was accidental. It was, under a clearly legitimate view of the evidence, a deliberate shooting and an attempt to remove the identity of a possible prosecuting witness, after a planned attempt at the robbery of an elderly, innocent person. It is indeed difficult, if not impossible, to explain away two fatal shots as being accidental and unintentional. This elderly victim was left by his robber on the street to die without any attempt to render aid or assistance. The accused was nearly 23 years of age. He had a criminal record, but this was not introduced before the jury. He saw fit not to take the stand at either the guilt or the sentencing phases of his trial. He was afforded a full and fair trial, and there is nothing to indicate any mitigating circumstances which could have outweighed the clearly aggravating circumstance which was proved and which was found by the jury.
It is, of course, part of the duty of this Court under the applicable statutory provisions to review a death sentence and to determine whether it was imposed in any arbitrary fashion. The Court is also required to determine whether the evidence supports the jury's finding of an aggravating circumstance and its finding of the absence of any mitigating circumstances sufficiently substantial to outweigh the aggravating circumstances. The Court is also required to determine whether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases. T.C.A. § 39-2-205(c).
We have examined the record and the briefs and arguments of counsel with these provisions before us. We are of the opinion that the death penalty was justified in this case, and that its imposition was neither arbitrary nor disproportionate. In several other cases the death penalty has been approved where the homicide occurred during the perpetration of an armed robbery. See State v. Harries, 657 S.W.2d 414 (Tenn. 1983); State v. Johnson, 632 S.W.2d 542 (Tenn. 1982); State v. Coleman, 619 S.W. 112 (Tenn. 1981); Houston v. State, 593 S.W.2d 267 (Tenn. 1980). Numerous other cases could be cited, but we think that the foregoing sufficiently illustrate the proposition that a deliberate, wanton murder committed during the course of or in an attempt to commit an armed robbery is sufficient to warrant the death penalty where the jury finds no mitigating circumstances whatever.
The judgment of conviction and the sentence are affirmed. Unless stayed or otherwise ordered by proper authority, the sentence will be carried out as provided by law on October 18, 1985. Costs are taxed to appellant.

 This is a motion to dismiss the appeal or affirm the judgment.
 [1] We have frequently held that such a motion should not be granted where it appears, after examination of the opening brief and the papers filed in support of the motion, that the case cannot be decided without examining the entire record. (Brown v. Gow, 126 Cal.App. 113 [14 PaCal.2d 322]; Ross v. Mahoney, 134 Cal.App. 199 [25 PaCal.2d 268]; Barr v. Hall, 9 Cal.App.2d 426 [49 PaCal.2d 1124].)
 At least two of the points raised on this appeal could not be decided without a complete examination of the entire record. This is virtually conceded by the respondent, whose notice of motion states that the same would be based upon the entire record on this appeal and also upon the entire record in a prior appeal. Moreover, in his argument in support of this motion he goes outside of the opening brief and the moving papers and presents matters which require a study of the entire record.
 An examination of the opening brief and the moving papers indicates that the questions here raised call for careful consideration and will require a thorough examination of the evidence, in all of which the court is entitled to the assistance of the respondent.
 The motion is denied.

UNITED STATES of America, Plaintiff-Appellee,v.Samuel William DONAGHE, Defendant-Appellant.
No. 93-30058.
United States Court of Appeals,Ninth Circuit.
Argued and Submitted Dec. 15, 1993.Decided Sept. 30, 1994.

Sheryl Gordon McCloud, Seattle, WA, for defendant-appellant.
Sean Connelly, U.S. Dept. of Justice, Washington, DC, for plaintiff-appellee.
Appeal from the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington.
Before:  BROWNING, NORRIS, and O'SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judges.
O'SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judge:


1
We must decide whether the district court based its upward departure from the Sentencing Guidelines on proper factors and explained adequately the extent of its departure.


2
* On November 21, 1988, Samuel Donaghe was sentenced for making a false statement in a passport application in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1542.  The district court did not apply the Sentencing Guidelines, because it was unclear at that time whether they were constitutional, and sentenced him to three years of probation.  Because Donaghe had a history of sexually assaulting minors--he had been convicted of four such offenses previously--the court imposed the condition, among others, that Donaghe not associate with minors without the consent of the Probation Office.


3
On March 8, 1990, the district court revoked Donaghe's probation pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3563 because he had violated conditions of probation.  Specifically, Donaghe had possessed a firearm, failed to inform the Probation Office of his new employment, associated with a minor foreign exchange student for whom he was the host parent, and been convicted in state court of solicitation to commit assault and two counts of rape.  The district court then sentenced Donaghe to five years imprisonment for the passport offense, again under pre-Guidelines law.


4
On appeal, this court vacated the sentence and held that the Guidelines applied.  We remanded for resentencing, specifying that the district court consider United States v. White, 925 F.2d 284 (9th Cir.1991).  United States v. Donaghe, No. 92-30183, 978 F.2d 716 (Table), 1992 WL 317200, 1992 U.S.App. LEXIS 29342 (9th Cir.  Sept. 15, 1992).  At resentencing on January 22, 1993, the district court adopted the Presentence Report ("PSR") that calculated Donaghe's criminal history category as 1, his total offense level as 4, and the resulting sentencing range as 0-6 months.  The court also adopted the PSR's recommendation to depart upward and imposed a sentence of five years imprisonment and three years supervised release.

II

5
When we remanded this case for resentencing under the Guidelines, we explicitly instructed the district court not to depart from the Guidelines based on Donaghe's conduct during probation.  Instead, we stated that "[i]f the district court chooses to depart it must cite factors, available to it at the original sentencing, sufficient to support its decision.  It may consider Donaghe's probation-violating conduct for its effect on the weighing of those departure factors."  Donaghe, 1992 WL 317200, at * 1, LEXIS 29342, at * 3.


6
We relied on White to reach this conclusion.  In that case, this court held that for resentencing under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3565,1 the district court could not use probation conduct to "directly increase a sentence."  White, 925 F.2d at 286.   The court stated that the district court could depart from the Guidelines range, "provided that facts warranting departure were available at the initial sentencing."  Id. at 287.   However, the court also noted that "probation-violating conduct is not completely irrelevant to sentencing under Sec. 3565(b)2....  [T]he sentencing court can consider the conduct in determining whether to depart from the initial guideline range....  In other words, the court cannot make additional factual findings to justify a departure, but can reconsider its original decision not to depart in light of the defendant's subsequent actions."  Id.


7
The Guidelines provide two means of departing upward from a sentence range:  adjusting the criminal history category when the Guidelines do not adequately reflect the seriousness of the offender's past conduct or the likelihood that he or she will commit other crimes, under U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.3, p.s., and adjusting the offense level to take into consideration aggravating circumstances to a kind or a degree not considered by the Guidelines, according to U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K2.0, p.s.


8
In evaluating these adjustments, the reviewing court does "not search the record for permissible reasons for departure;  instead, [it] analyze[s] the reasons actually given by the district court."  United States v. Montenegro-Rojo, 908 F.2d 425, 428 (9th Cir.1990).  Here, the district court, for the most part, relied on the PSR to articulate the reasons for departure.  The PSR listed three factors that "were known to the Court at the time of the original sentence and would have justified an upward departure."   First, Donaghe had been convicted between 1967 and 1973 of several sex-related crimes involving minors.  Second, at the time of the original sentencing, he was being investigated for sexual misconduct with his nephew.  Finally, a 1968 psychiatric evaluation diagnosed Donaghe as having a "sexual deviation, homosexuality with pedophilia."   For the upward departure to be valid, all these factors must be proper bases for departure.  Id.  (If the district court "considered both proper and improper bases for departure, 'we have no way to determine whether any portion of the sentence was based upon consideration of the improper factors,' and must therefore vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing") (citation omitted).


9
* As a basis for its departure, the district court relied on its determination that Donaghe's criminal history category inadequately reflected his past criminal conduct.  The Guidelines do not allow past sentences of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month and occurring more than fifteen years before the sentencing date to be considered in determining a criminal history category.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.2(e)(1), (3).  The Guidelines do not allow any other past sentences occurring more than ten years before the sentencing date to be considered in determining a criminal history category.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.2(d)(2), (3).  Donaghe's misconduct occurred fifteen years prior to the initial sentencing.


10
However, the commentary to section 4A1.2 creates an exception for sentences imposed outside these time periods where the court finds "evidence of similar, or serious dissimilar, criminal conduct."   U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.2, comment.  (n. 8).  If the misconduct meets this description, "the court may consider this information in determining whether an upward departure is warranted."   Id.


11
* Donaghe argues that his convictions for child molestation are not similar to the instant offense of falsifying a passport application.  The government has the burden of demonstrating that such similarity exists.  United States v. Starr, 971 F.2d 357, 362 (9th Cir.1992).  The government argues that the crimes are similar because Donaghe was motivated to falsify the passport application in order to escape an investigation into new child molestation charges.  Thus, the government maintains, the crimes were "inextricably linked."


12
The government's argument must fail.  Although there may be a causal link between Donaghe's tendency toward sexually abusing children and the false application--because of his criminal behavior, he was in trouble and wanted to flee the country--this does not make the two crimes similar.  The government's reasoning does not comport with this court's understanding of similarity, which requires a much closer likeness.  For instance, in Starr, we held that possession of stolen property and embezzlement were similar to bank robbery, because all were "crimes of theft."  971 F.2d at 362.   We did not require "[i]nquiry into the specific facts of the prior convictions."  Id.  And, in United States v. Cota-Guerrero, 907 F.2d 87 (9th Cir.1990), we concluded that past convictions for assault with a deadly weapon and assault and battery were similar to possession of a firearm by a felon because "they show a propensity toward violence and a willingness to use force."  Id. at 89.   As in Starr, we did not examine the particular facts surrounding each crime but instead concentrated on their general characteristics.


13
Child molestation and passport fraud have no characteristics in common.  Unlike the crimes in Starr and Cota-Guerrero, they cannot be categorized together as crimes of fraud or of violence.  They are linked only by the specific circumstances of this case, a factor not viewed as relevant.  The crimes, thus, are not similar under the section 4A1.2 commentary.

2

14
The commentary to section 4A1.2 also creates an exception for serious dissimilar past crimes.   Donaghe argues that this part of the commentary is not applicable to his case because it was introduced by amendment effective November 1, 1992 and his original sentencing occurred on November 21, 1988.  We agree.


15
The amendment to the commentary of section 4A1.2 has been designated a clarifying change.  U.S.S.G.App. C n. 472.  Normally, when an amendment is deemed clarifying rather than substantive, it is applied retroactively.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.11(b)(2).  However, it will not be applied retroactively when, as here, it would violate the ex post facto clause.  United States v. Smallwood, 35 F.3d 414, 417-18, n. 8 (9th Cir.1994).  Thus, the 1992 amendment to the commentary to section 4A1.2 does not apply.

3

16
Section 4A1.3 also allows a court to depart because the criminal history category does not adequately reflect the likelihood that the offender will commit other crimes.  The PSR improperly included Donaghe's 1968 diagnosis as a homosexual deviant as a factor for departure.  Homosexuality is no longer categorized as a psychiatric disorder.  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (1987) (DSM-III-R).  Further, the fact that someone is a homosexual is not indicative of his or her propensity to commit crimes.  See Beam v. Paskett, 3 F.3d 1301, 1310 (9th Cir.1993) ("It goes without saying that society has abandoned its earlier belief that homosexuality presents a danger to the community."), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1631, 128 L.Ed.2d 354 (1994).


17
Although the PSR's notation that Donaghe was also diagnosed as an untreatable pedophile might be a reason for believing that he will commit other crimes, the court did not make factual findings supporting the existence of this factor, United States v. Lira-Barraza, 941 F.2d 745, 746 (9th Cir.1991) (en banc), other than to mention the outdated psychiatric report.  Since it is not at all clear from the PSR that the twenty-five year old psychiatric evaluation is still valid or that a pedophile is likely to continue to molest children, the court's limited factual findings do not support the diagnosis as a basis for departure.


18
The district court also identified a January 1992 psychological evaluation, which concluded that Donaghe may continue his criminal behavior.  Since this evaluation was not available as a factor at the initial sentencing, it cannot be a departure factor.

B

19
The district court also based its departure on its determination that Donaghe's offense level was inadequate.  Section 5K2.0 provides for adjusting an offense level if the offense involves "factors in addition to those identified that have not been given adequate consideration by the Commission," or "if the court determines that, in light of unusual circumstances, the guideline level attached to that factor is inadequate."   U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K2.0, p.s.  The pending criminal investigation of Donaghe for possible sexual misconduct with his nephew was a fact available at the initial sentencing and was a departure factor listed in the PSR.  The government argues that the incident of passport fraud was atypical, because Donaghe's motive was to escape possible prosecution for sexual misconduct.  The government contends that this justifies an upward departure in the offense level.


20
There is no mention in the Guidelines that the Sentencing Commission considered the reasons why a person might want to obtain a false passport.  However, the version of section 5K2.0 in effect in November 1988 stated that "[h]arms identified as a possible basis for departure from the guidelines should be taken into account only when they are relevant to the offense of conviction."   U.S.S.G.App. C n. 358.  Intending to use the false passport for the purpose of escaping criminal prosecution is not an element of the crime of making a false statement in a passport application.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1542.  Since Donaghe's reason for wanting a fake passport is not relevant to the offense of falsifying the application, that reason could not be a basis for increasing the offense level in 1988.  See, e.g., United States v. Cervantes Lucatero, 889 F.2d 916, 917 & n. 1 (9th Cir.1989) (holding upward departure inappropriate where it was based on district court's determination that offender's reason for entering United States illegally was not to seek work and help his family but to "live off the land" and "violate its laws").


21
The district court also identified as a factor supporting an increase in offense level the fact that "Judge Ingram in the original sentence imposed a special condition that he not be around minor children....  And the conduct for which Donaghe stands having committed on the revocation are all directly related to that conduct in the original sentence."   The fact that Donaghe violated this probation condition was not available at the initial sentencing and so cannot be a departure factor.

C

22
Because all of the factors considered by the district court were improper bases for departure, we must vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.  Montenegro-Rojo, 908 F.2d at 428.   At resentencing, the district court must not base its departure on Donaghe's diagnosis as a homosexual, the similarity between passport fraud and sexual misconduct, Donaghe's prior molestation convictions or any of Donaghe's conduct during probation.

III

23
Donaghe argues that the departure from a sentencing range of 0 to 6 months to a sentence of 60 months was unreasonable.  A district court abuses its discretion in departing upward if it "gave no reason or justification for the extent of its departure."  United States v. Beck, 992 F.2d 1008, 1009 (9th Cir.1993).  The district court must make an "effort to tie the departure to the Guidelines," through a "reasoned explanation of the extent of the departure founded on the structure, standards and policies of the Act and Guidelines."  United States v. Ramirez-Jiminez, 967 F.2d 1321, 1329 (9th Cir.1992) (quoting Lira-Barraza, 941 F.2d at 745).   This is generally accomplished, in a case of inadequate criminal history, by "analog[izing] to higher criminal history categories."  Beck, 992 F.2d at 1109.  "Ordinarily, the court should determine whether a defendant's actual criminal history most closely resembles the next higher criminal history category before concluding that the defendant's record is so severe that comparison to a higher category is warranted."  Starr, 971 F.2d at 363.


24
The district court here made no attempt to explain the extent of the departure when it adopted the recommendations of the PSR.  The PSR calculated the new offense level of 24 (resulting in a sentencing range of 51 to 63 months) by adding to Donaghe's original level four offense a ten level increase for the two rape convictions, a five level increase for the solicitation to commit assault conviction, a three level increase for possession of a firearm, and a two level increase for his attempted solicitation of assault.  These numbers appear to have been chosen at random;  the report does not explain any rationale behind them.  Neither does the report attempt to analogize Donaghe's supposedly unusual offense or inadequate criminal history to the next highest level or category.


25
Finally, the PSR conflates departures in offense level and in criminal history category.  As explained above, some of the departure factors identified in the PSR are the type that might support an increased criminal history category, while others are the kind that might support a higher offense level.  But the report increases only Donaghe's offense level and does not explain upon which of the factors it relies.  It cannot rely on all the factors because some, like the prior convictions, could possibly support only a higher criminal history category.


26
We vacate the sentence and remand because the district court abused its discretion by not adequately explaining the extent of the departure.  At resentencing, the district court must explain the extent of its departure by analogizing the increased criminal history category or offense level to the next relevant category or offense level.3

IV

27
Donaghe argues that the district court improperly ordered his sentence to run consecutively with his state law sentences for the probation-violating crimes.  He points to the current language of section 5G1.3(b), providing for concurrent sentences.  However, since we apply the Guidelines effective on the date of sentencing, United States v. Warren, 980 F.2d 1300, 1304 (9th Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 397, 126 L.Ed.2d 344 (1993), we must apply the version of section 5G1.3(b) in force in November 1988.


28
The version of section 5G1.3 effective in November 1988 stated, "[i]f at the time of sentencing, the defendant is already serving one or more unexpired sentences, then the sentences for the instant offense(s) shall run consecutively to such unexpired sentences."   U.S.S.C.App. C n. 289.  Donaghe was serving a state sentence when the district court ordered consecutive sentences.  Thus, applying the 1988 version to Donaghe's situation, the district court's imposition of consecutive sentences was appropriate.4

V

29
Donaghe argues that the district court cannot impose a period of supervised release on resentencing after probation revocation.  His claim is not persuasive because the authorities he cites address resentencing after the revocation of supervised release.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3583;  United States v. Behnezhad, 907 F.2d 896 (9th Cir.1990).


30
However, the controlling statute for resentencing after probation revocation is 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3565.  The court in Behnezhad emphasized the difference between sections 3583 and 3565.  After concluding that section 3583 did not allow a new term of supervised release, the court explained that section 3565 allowed for "greater flexibility to create terms of punishment for violations of probation."  907 F.2d at 899.  "[W]hen a court revokes probation, it has the flexibility to structure a new sentence that may include probation, incarceration, fines and supervised release."  Id.  Therefore, the court did not err in imposing a three year term of supervised release.

VI

31
Donaghe requests that the panel remand the case to a new judge.  In United States v. Arnett, 628 F.2d 1162 (9th Cir.1979), the court stated that the relevant factors for making this decision are "(1) whether the original judge would reasonably be expected upon remand to have substantial difficulty in putting out of his or her mind previously-expressed views or findings determined to be erroneous or based on evidence that must be rejected, (2) whether reassignment is advisable to preserve the appearance of justice, and (3) whether reassignment would entail waste and duplication out of proportion to any gain in preserving the appearance of fairness."  Id. at 1165 (quoting United States v. Robin, 553 F.2d 8, 10 (2d Cir.1977) (en banc)).


32
The Ninth Circuit has remanded under the first factor when the error was created by the judge.  United States v. Larios, 640 F.2d 938, 943-44 (9th Cir.1981);  United States v. Doe, 655 F.2d 920, 928-29 (9th Cir.1980).  Here, Judge Tanner erred in identifying factors supporting departure that were not available at the initial sentencing.  Also, he adopted the PSR's sentence recommendation, which relied on Donaghe's probation-violating conduct to justify an extreme upward departure, without explaining what "new light [the conduct] sheds on where to sentence within the original Guidelines range or whether or how much to depart."  Donaghe, 1992 WL 317200, at * 1, 1992 U.S.App. LEXIS 29342, at * 3.


33
Although Judge Tanner created the error, there is no significant showing that he was biased against Donaghe.  Reassignment to a new judge is not necessary to preserve the appearance of justice.

VII

34
Because all of the departure factors identified by the district court were improper, we vacate the sentence and remand.  Also, the district court's failure to explain the extent of the departure requires us to remand.  However, the imposition of three years supervised release and consecutive sentences was proper.


35
AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, VACATED and REMANDED.



1
 This statute provides that on resentencing after probation revocation, the district court must impose "any other sentence that was available ... at the time of the initial sentencing."  18 U.S.C. Secs. 3565(a) and 3565(b)


2
 Although the facts in White involved probation revocation under Sec. 3565(b), the court explained that Sec. 3565(a) used the same language, and so the case's analysis applied to both sections.  Id. at 286 n. 1


3
 Donaghe argues that on remand the Revocation Table of U.S.S.G. Sec. 7B1.4 should control resentencing.  This table establishes sentencing ranges by taking account of criminal history categories and probation-violating conduct.  However, in United States v. Dixon, 952 F.2d 260 (9th Cir.1991), the Ninth Circuit held that this section contradicted 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3565(a).  Section 3565(a) requires the court to impose a sentence that was "available ... at the time of the initial sentencing," while the Revocation Table "require[s] courts to impose sentences that, in many cases, were not 'available' at the time of initial sentencing."  Id. at 261.   To the extent that the Guidelines conflicted with the statute, the court found them invalid.  Id. at 260.   Therefore, the district court should not be guided by the Revocation Table at resentencing


4
 The government argues that U.S.S.G. Sec. 7B1.3(f), p.s. governs this question.  However, in November 1988, that section did not exist

                   Appeal from the United States District Court
                        for the Southern District of Texas
                             USDC No. 5:11-CR-770-2


Before JONES, DENNIS, and HAYNES, Circuit Judges.
PER CURIAM:*
        A jury convicted Artemio Lomas of one count of conspiracy to possess with
intent to distribute 1,000 kilograms or more of marijuana in violation of 21
U.S.C. §§ 846 and 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A) and two counts of possession with intent
to distribute 100 kilograms or more of marijuana in violation of § 841(a)(1),
(b)(1)(B). The district court sentenced Lomas to three concurrent terms of 151
months in prison. Lomas argues for the first time on appeal that the district



       *
         Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not
be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR.
R. 47.5.4.
   Case: 11-41328    Document: 00512042106      Page: 2   Date Filed: 11/02/2012

                                  No. 11-41328

court erred in calculating the drug quantity attributable to him under the
Sentencing Guidelines by using the gross weight rather than the net weight.
      Because Lomas did not object in the district court to the drug quantity
attributed to him, our review is for plain error. United States v. Conn, 657 F.3d
280, 284 (5th Cir. 2011); United States v. Sparks, 2 F.3d 574, 589 (5th Cir. 1993).
Simply put, Lomas has not demonstrated that the court used the gross weight
rather than the net weight. Neither the trial testimony nor the presentence
report (PSR) referenced either gross weight or net weight. Furthermore, the
district court was entitled to rely on the jury’s finding that Lomas conspired to
possess with intent to distribute 1000 kilograms or more of marijuana and
Lomas’s admission that the facts in the PSR were correct. See United States v.
Arnold, 416 F.3d 349, 362 (5th Cir. 2005); United States v. Ramirez, 557 F.3d
200, 204 (5th Cir. 2009). In light of the trial testimony, the jury’s finding, and
Lomas’s admission, Lomas has not show that the district court committed any
error, and certainly not clear or obvious error, when it relied on the drug
quantity indicated in the PSR. See United States v. Rodriguez, 602 F.3d 346, 363
(5th Cir. 2010).
      AFFIRMED.

978 A.2d 6 (2009)
2009 VT 48
STATE of Vermont
v.
Timothy MUMLEY.
No. 08-114.
Supreme Court of Vermont.
May 8, 2009.
*7 Thomas Donovan, Jr., Chittenden County State's Attorney, and Pamela Hall Johnson, Deputy State's Attorney, Burlington, for Plaintiff-Appellee.
Edward M. Kenney, South Burlington, for Defendant-Appellant.
*8 Present: REIBER, C.J., DOOLEY, JOHNSON, SKOGLUND and BURGESS, JJ.
¶ 1. SKOGLUND, J.
Defendant Timothy Mumley appeals from a jury conviction for attempted kidnapping in violation of 13 V.S.A. §§ 9, 2405(a)(1)(D). Defendant argues that the Chittenden District Court committed reversible error when it denied his motion to suppress statements he made to police while in custody. We agree, and reverse.
¶ 2. Defendant's conviction arises from an incident that occurred on October 20, 2006. On that date, defendant allegedly tried to pull a woman into his pickup truck while she was pushing her child in a stroller on a Winooski sidewalk. Defendant was arrested and taken to the Winooski Police Department, where he was questioned by a detective in an interrogation room. The entire interrogation was video-recorded.
¶ 3. Prior to questioning defendant, the detective warned defendant of his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to counsel as required by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), and 13 V.S.A. § 5234. He read defendant his warnings one-by-one, from a Miranda-waiver form. The form listed each of the Miranda rights followed by the question "Do you understand?" and a blank space for a reply. After reciting each warning to defendant, the detective asked defendant whether he understood. Defendant replied "yes" to each of these questions. The detective recorded defendant's replies on the form.
¶ 4. Underneath the Miranda-rights portion of the form was the title "Waiver," and the following paragraph:
I have been advised of my rights and I understand them. No threats or promises have been made to me. Knowing my rights, I agree to waive them and talk with you now. I understand that I am waiving my right to be represented by an attorney, to talk with an attorney before questioning and to have an attorney present during questioning.
Under this paragraph was a space for the date and time and a space for a signature or "time of taping."
¶ 5. The detective did not read the entire waiver paragraph to defendant. Rather, the detective read only the following: "I have been advised of my rights and I understand them. No threats or promises have been made to me. Knowing my rights, I agree to waive ...." The detective did not provide defendant with the opportunity to read the balance of the form nor did he have defendant sign the form. The following exchange then occurred:
Detective: Do you want to talk to me?
Defendant: What about?
Detective: Ah, what, ah ... you can talk to me, you can tell me to pound sand. You know, those are your rights, okay? Now, it doesn't affect them one way or the other. What I'm concerned about is that, I want to make sure, you know, what happened tonight, you be given an opportunity to, you know, explain your actions which will happen in a court of law. But this is also an opportunity for you, if you want it, you can write down a sworn statement and apologize for what happened tonight. That's something. It's your choice you know.
Defendant: Which is what?
Detective: Do you understand what is going on here at all?
Defendant: No, no, I don't.
Detective: Well, as I stated over at your apartment, you're under arrest for attempted kidnapping.
Defendant: Okay.
*9 ¶ 6. The detective made no more attempts to secure a waiver of defendant's rights to silence and to an attorney. Eventually, defendant answered some of the detective's questions.
¶ 7. Defendant sought to suppress the statements he made during the interrogation. In his motion to suppress, defendant argued that he did not waive his rights, or, in the alternative, that the waiver was invalid under Miranda. Defendant also argued that the detective violated his rights by failing to secure a recorded waiver as required by 13 V.S.A. § 5237. Section 5237 provides that a person who has been informed of his or her right to counsel as required by § 5234 may waive those rights:
in writing, or by other record, ... if the court, at the time of or after waiver, finds of record that he has acted with full awareness of his rights and of the consequences of a waiver and if the waiver is otherwise according to law. The court shall consider such factors as the person's age, education, and familiarity with the English language, and the complexity of the crime involved.
13 V.S.A. § 5237. The State responded, arguing that, considering the totality of the circumstances, defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his Miranda rights, and that defendant's waiver was valid under § 5237 because it was video-recorded.
¶ 8. The district court denied defendant's motion. It concluded that "assuming the court finds that defendant possessed the requisite experience, education, background, and intelligence to understand the nature of his Miranda rights and the consequences of waiving them," defendant made a valid implicit waiver of his Miranda rights. The court then concluded that because this waiver was recorded on video it was valid under § 5237.
¶ 9. At trial, the complainant testified that defendant tried to pull her into his black pickup truck while she was pushing her child in a stroller on a sidewalk, returning home from the post office. She further testified about the encounter as follows. As the complainant walked north on Weaver Street, defendant started following her in his truck, making rude, sexually suggestive remarks, and asking her if she wanted a ride. She was walking northward on the west side of Weaver Street, and defendant was travelling northward in the wrong lane of traffic, weaving around parked cars, so that he was in the lane of traffic adjacent to her. During this portion of the encounter the complainant threatened to call the police. At some point, defendant proceeded ahead of her to the intersection of Weaver and Union Streets and turned left onto Union Street. She proceeded to the same intersection, crossed Union Street, and turned left, walking on the north side of Union Street. While the complainant was walking on Union Street, defendant, who was ahead of her, turned around in a driveway, drove back toward her, then crossed into the wrong lane of traffic again, stopped the truck, and attempted to grab her and pull her into his pickup. Defendant drove off when the driver of a green Ford in the oncoming lane of Union Street honked the horn twice.
¶ 10. One eyewitness testified for the State. The witness testified that while traveling north on Weaver Street in her green Ford Taurus, she noticed that traffic had stopped because of a dark pickup truck that had stopped in the middle of the road two cars in front of her. She testified that the man in the pickup truck was speaking with someone on the sidewalk. According to the witness, after she honked her horn twice, the truck "took off," and the witness then observed the complainant, "visibly upset ... motoring towards the *10 end of [Weaver] [S]treet." In contrast to the complainant's testimony, the witness testified that the truck did not turn left on Union Street, but rather either continued straight or turned right, and that the witness did not turn left on Union Street. The witness testified that after observing the encounter she continued straight on Weaver Street.
¶ 11. The arresting officer and a detective also testified for the State. The officer testified that defendant's truck and license plate number matched the description given by the complainant. The detective testified that the complainant correctly identified defendant in a photo lineup. The detective also testified that, during the interrogation at the police station, defendant admitted: (1) that he had seen the complainant; (2) that he had driven by her several times; (3) that the complainant spoke to him; (4) that the complainant told defendant that she was calling the police; and (5) that, when asked why the complainant would threaten to call the police, defendant replied that he did not know.
¶ 12. At trial, the defense argued that the complainant's story was improbable and that neither defendant nor the eyewitness made a left on Union Street toward the site of the alleged attempted kidnapping.
¶ 13. On appeal, defendant argues that he did not make a valid waiver of his Miranda rights because: (a) silence in response to a request to waive does not constitute waiver; and (b) the court failed to properly apply the totality-of-the-circumstances approach articulated in State v. Malinowski, 148 Vt. 517, 518-20, 536 A.2d 921, 922-23 (1987). Defendant also argues that the waiver was invalid under § 5237 because: (a) that section requires waivers to be affirmative, express, and recorded; and (b) the trial court failed to consider the factors set forth in the statute. Finally, defendant makes several arguments regarding the court's refusal to viewor to allow the jury to viewthe vehicle defendant was driving at the scene of the alleged crime. We agree with defendant that the court erred in not evaluating the factors set forth in Malinowski and § 5237, and do not reach the balance of his arguments.
¶ 14. Under the United States Supreme Court's landmark decision in Miranda, "a heavy burden rests on the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel." 384 U.S. at 475, 86 S.Ct. 1602; see also State v. Stanislaw, 153 Vt. 517, 529, 573 A.2d 286, 293 (1990) ("The State bears a heavy burden in showing a waiver of Miranda rights."). Courts may find that a defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his Miranda rights only "upon an inquiry into the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation." Fare v. Michael C., 442 U.S. 707, 724-25, 99 S.Ct. 2560, 61 L.Ed.2d 197 (1979) (citing Miranda, 384 U.S. at 475-77, 86 S.Ct. 1602). "The totality approach permits indeed, it mandatesinquiry into all the circumstances surrounding the interrogation." Id. at 725, 99 S.Ct. 2560. We noted in Malinowski that in Fare v. Michael C. the United States Supreme Court specifically mandated a totality-of-the-circumstances approach to evaluating Miranda waivers. 148 Vt. at 522, 536 A.2d at 924. In order for a court to find that a defendant has made a knowing and intelligent waiver, we require it to make findings regarding the "defendant's experience, education, background, intelligence or capacity to understand the warnings and the meaning of a waiver." Id.; see also State v. Tribble, 2005 VT 132, ¶ 27, 179 Vt. 235, 892 A.2d 232 ("In reviewing whether a *11 defendant made a valid waiver, we consider the totality of the circumstances.").
¶ 15. In addition to our case law, our statutory law requires courts to consider the circumstances under which a defendant waives the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to counsel as guaranteed by Miranda and § 5234 before concluding that the waiver was valid. Under § 5237, a defendant's waiver is valid if the court finds that "he has acted with full awareness of his rights and of the consequences of a waiver and if the waiver is otherwise according to law." In making such findings, "[t]he court shall consider such factors as the person's age, education, and familiarity with the English language, and the complexity of the crime involved." Id. (emphasis added). Although the statute's discretionary "such factors as" language affords trial courts flexibility in choosing which factors to consider, the mandatory "shall" creates a requirement impervious to judicial discretion. See Town of Victory v. State, 174 Vt. 539, 544, 814 A.2d 369, 376 (2002) (mem.) ("Use of the word `shall' in a statute generally means that the action is mandatory...."). In short, under § 5237, a court must consider factors indicating whether a defendant acted with full awareness of his rights, and the consequences of waiving those rights, before finding that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived them.
¶ 16. Here, the trial court's decision and order denying defendant's motion to suppress contains no consideration of factors indicating a knowing and intelligent waiver of Miranda rights as required by Fare and Malinowski, and no consideration of factors indicating his awareness of his § 5234 rights and the consequences of waiving them as required by § 5237. Instead, as far as we can tell from its order, the court reached its conclusion that defendant made a valid waiver of his rights by "assuming ... that defendant possessed the requisite experience, education, background, and intelligence to understand the nature of his ... rights and the consequences of waiving them." The trial court erred under Malinowski and § 5237 by failing to make the required inquiry.
¶ 17. The State argues that defendant failed to preserve the issue we address above, and, alternatively, that any erroneous admission did not prejudice defendant's case. Neither argument has merit.
¶ 18. The State contends that defendant did not preserve the argument that his waiver was invalid because his motion to suppress the statements at issue argued only that there was no waiver at all. This Court has long held that issues not presented at trial may not be raised on appeal. See, e.g., Lanphere v. Beede, 141 Vt. 126, 129, 446 A.2d 340, 341 (1982) ("Contentions not raised or fairly presented to the trial court are not preserved for appeal."); Bebee v. Steel, 2 Vt. 314, 316 (1829) (same). However, where a litigant's argument is clear enough for the trial court to evaluate it and for an opponent to respond to it, the claim is adequately preserved for appeal. EBWS, LLC v. Britly Corp., 2007 VT 37, ¶ 12, 181 Vt. 513, 928 A.2d 497.
¶ 19. We read defendant's motion to suppress as arguing primarily that he did not waive his Miranda and § 5234 rights, and arguing alternatively that any implied waiver was not knowing and intelligent, and therefore was invalid. In support of his motion, defendant explicitly cited Stanislaw for the proposition that the State must prove a "knowing and intelligent" waiver, and argued that "[t]he detective's conduct in this matter could not more closely match Miranda's scenario of an invalid waiver." Although we would not *12 place a trial court in error regarding an issue it did not have the opportunity to address, the trial court here had that opportunity. Moreover, the trial court referenced the factors it was required to consider, but erred by making an assumption instead of making the required factual findings. Defendant placed the issue of validity squarely before the trial court and thus preserved it.
¶ 20. The State's argument that any erroneous admission of statements was harmless and nonprejudicial also fails. Under the Vermont Rules of Criminal Procedure, "[a]ny error ... which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded." V.R.Cr.P. 52(a). "For the error to be harmless, the reviewing court must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have returned a guilty verdict regardless of the error." State v. Oscarson, 2004 VT 4, ¶ 30, 176 Vt. 176, 845 A.2d 337. When conducting a harmless-error analysis to determine whether the jury would have convicted without the offending evidence, we consider the extent to which the offending evidence was inculpatory, whether it was cumulative or duplicative of other evidence, and how prominent it was at trial. See State v. Keith, 160 Vt. 257, 265-66, 628 A.2d 1247, 1252-53 (1993) (considering whether erroneously admitted evidence was inculpatory or exculpatory), overruled on other grounds by State v. Brillon, 2008 VT 35 ¶ 42, 183 Vt. 475, 955 A.2d 1108;[1]State v. Lynds, 158 Vt. 37, 42, 605 A.2d 501, 503 (1991) (considering prominence of erroneously admitted evidence at trial and presence or absence of corroborating and contradictory evidence). Analyzing these factors helps us understand how heavily the jury was likely to have relied on the evidence.
¶ 21. Here, the trial court erroneously admitted five statements that defendant made to police while in custody: (1) that defendant had seen the complainant; (2) that he had driven by her several times; (3) that the complainant spoke to him; (4) that the complainant told him that she was calling the police; and (5) that, when the detective asked him why the complainant would threaten to call the police, defendant replied that he did not know.
¶ 22. The extent to which the statements were inculpatory or duplicative varied. Defendant's statement that he had seen the complainant placed him at the scene of the alleged attempted kidnapping. Similarly, defendant's statements that the complainant spoke to him, that she threatened to call the police, and that he did not know why she would do so, constituted an admission that there had been an interaction between them. However, all of these statements were corroborated by eyewitness testimony, the complainant's testimony, or both.
¶ 23. Most prejudicial was defendant's statement that he drove by the complainant several times. This statement substantially undermined the defense's theory of the case. The defense argued that defendant may have had an interaction with the complainant, but that he never turned left on Union Street toward the site of the alleged attempted kidnapping or turned his truck around. The eyewitness's testimony that neither she nor defendant turned left on Union Street tended to support the defense's theory and discredit the complainant's version of events. Defendant's statement that he drove past the complainant several times had the potential *13 to cast significant doubt on the defense's theory and to bolster the complainant's story. Additionally, because the eyewitness in the green Ford testified that defendant went straight or right at the intersection of Weaver and Union, defendant's statement that he drove past the complainant several times is corroborated by the complainant's testimony alone.
¶ 24. All of defendant's statements to police were fairly prominent at trial. In addition to offering them into evidence, the State referred to defendant's statements in its opening and closing statements. In its opening, the State explained that the evidence would show:
[Defendant] admitted that he had seen thisa woman, this person pushing a stroller. He also made statements that there was a conversation. And he also told the police that at some point the woman mentioned to him, that she mentioned something about calling the police and the police asked [defendant], "Why would she say that?" And [defendant]'s response was, "I don't know."
Defendant's statements were introduced at trial through the detective who interrogated him, and were central to the detective's testimony. The prosecuting attorney referred to them four additional times while questioning the detective. In its closing, the State summarized the erroneously admitted statements and suggested what inferences the jury could draw from them:
Does he admit to [the detective] that he was in Winooski? You bet. Does he admit to [the detective] that he saw a young woman? You bet. Does he admit to [the detective] that he saw that stroller? Yup. Does he admit that he actually had a conversation with this woman? Yup. Does he admit that he heard her say, "I'm going to call the police." Yes.[2]
¶ 25. In short, defendant's erroneously admitted statements to police were harmful enough to his case and prominent enough at trial to have prejudiced defendant's case. In the aggregate, they create a reasonable doubt as to whether the jury would have rendered a guilty verdict without them, and thus require us to reverse defendant's conviction and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
¶ 26. In conclusion, the trial court erred by admitting defendant's custodial statements without conducting the required totality-of-the-circumstances inquiry into the validity of defendant's waiver. Because we cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the error was harmless, we reverse.
Reversed and remanded.
NOTES
[1]  The United States Supreme Court recently overruled Brillon on grounds unrelated to today's decision. Vermont v. Brillon, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 1283, 1287, 173 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009).
[2]  The record indicates that the State's closing argument continued as follows:

But then an interesting thing happened. By this time he knows he's in trouble and he decides to shift the blame away from him to her and he tells the police officer this story about driving up Weaver Street or driving in Winooski and he sees a woman acting weird and she's saying something, he doesn't have a clue what she's saying, she's yelling at him, and so instead of just passing by and just going home, by the way, it's raining at this point, instead of going home, he turns around and comes back to get another look at her.
The statements referred to in this part of the State's closing argument were not entered into evidence and were not objected to by defendant. We therefore do not evaluate their potential effect on the jury verdict.

George D. EUBANKS
v.
Jo Ann HALL.
AV92000080.
Court of Civil Appeals of Alabama.
July 23, 1993.
*774 D.E. Brutkiewicz, Jr., of Brutkiewicz Attorneys, Mobile, for appellant.
Samuel N. Crosby and L. Brian Chunn of Stone, Granade, Crosby & Blackburn, P.C., Bay Minette, for appellee.
THIGPEN, Judge.
This is a malicious prosecution case.
Jo Ann Hall filed suit against George D. Eubanks in September 1991, charging him with malicious prosecution and seeking $1 million in damages. She alleged that the complaint resulted from an arrest warrant which Eubanks had sworn against Hall, charging her with criminal charges, and that she sustained damages, including legal expenses, although the criminal proceedings terminated in her favor. Following a jury trial, the jury returned a verdict favoring Hall in the amount of $10,000, and the trial court entered a judgment accordingly. Eubanks appeals.
Eubanks contends on appeal that the trial court erred in allowing certain testimony to be admitted at trial; that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict; and that the trial court improperly refused to use his proffered jury instructions regarding punitive damages.
At the outset, we note that jury verdicts are presumed to be correct. Uphaus v. Charter Hospital of Mobile, 582 So.2d 1140 (Ala.Civ.App.1991). Malicious prosecution actions, however, are not favored in law, and face stringent limitations. Uphaus, supra.
The elements of an action for malicious prosecution are: "(1) a judicial proceeding initiated by the defendant; (2) the lack of probable cause; (3) malice on the part of the defendant; (4) termination of the judicial proceeding favorably to the plaintiff; and, (5) damages." Empiregas, Inc., of Elberta v. Feely, 524 So.2d 626, 627 (Ala.1988).
Testimony adduced at trial reveals that Eubanks apparently was tried in an August 1991 criminal proceeding, and, according to Hall, her husband testified against Eubanks. There is testimony that afterwards, Eubanks reportedly threatened to "get" the witnesses who testified against him. Hall testified that approximately one month after Eubanks's trial, she and another woman were cleaning crabs on Hall's property on Tensaw Island when Eubanks's son and his cousin began travelling on the river, yelling obscenities. Hall testified that when she and the other woman got into a boat to bait the crab baskets in the river, Eubanks's son and nephew deliberately maneuvered close to Hall's boat, splashing Hall with water. She testified that Eubanks's son was on a "kneeboard" and was riding in the water behind the boat, and that at that time, they came so close that she believed that their boat would hit them. She stated that he fell from the kneeboard, and that she and the other woman drove the boat over to him and accused him of trying to run over them. They then told the boys that they were going to call the water patrol.
At trial, Eubanks's nephew disputed Hall's version of events. Eubanks's nephew testified that after the alleged incident, he called the police for Eubanks's son, and that Eubanks's son told the police that Hall cursed them, and that there was a paddle and gun involved. The nephew also testified that Eubanks actually signed the complaint at the police's behest, because Eubanks's son and nephew were too young to sign the complaint.
Although Hall was charged with harassment and menacing, the trial court granted Hall's motion for judgment of acquittal in September 1991, and Hall filed suit against Eubanks for malicious prosecution that same month.
Eubanks first contends that the trial court erred in admitting, over his objection, testimony regarding his prior acts. Jerry Crowe, another witness in Eubanks's criminal trial, testified that after that trial, Eubanks harassed him in various ways, including discharging firearms near Crowe's house, making numerous phone calls to him, and by harassing him while driving. A person's character, when offered for the purpose of showing his conduct on a specific occasion, *775 may not be proven by evidence of his specific acts or conduct. Mayfield v. State, 591 So.2d 143 (Ala.Crim.App.1991); C. Gamble, McElroy's Alabama Evidence, § 26.01 (4th ed. 1991). Hall argues that Crowe's testimony was proffered not to show that Eubanks acted in conformity therewith in signing the complaint, but rather to establish Eubanks's malice towards the witnesses who testified against him at his criminal trial.
Malice, for purposes of a malicious prosecution action, may be inferred from want of probable cause or it may be inferred from the circumstances surrounding and attending prosecution. Thompson v. Kinney, 486 So.2d 442 (Ala.Civ.App.1986). "This is because malice is incapable of positive, direct proof and must out of necessity be rested on inferences and deductions from facts which are heard by the trier of fact." Thompson at 445. The element of malice may be inferred from the conduct of the defendant if no other reasonable explanation exists for his actions. Johnson v. Smith, 503 So.2d 868 (Ala.Civ. App.1987). Therefore, Crowe's testimony was admissible for the narrow purpose of establishing Eubanks's malice towards the witnesses.
Eubanks next contends that the trial court erred in refusing to grant his motion for a directed verdict. A directed verdict in favor of a defendant is proper only when there is no evidence to support one or more of the elements in the plaintiff's cause of action. Smith v. Wendy's of the South, Inc., 503 So.2d 843 (Ala.1987). Eubanks argues that Hall had failed to prove he lacked probable cause for instigating the judicial proceedings against Hall.
Probable cause is the state of facts which would lead a person of reasonable prudence to honestly believe that the claims put forth in the prior suit would prevail. Empiregas, supra. The issue of probable cause must go to a jury when the material facts are in dispute, as in this case. Harris v. Harris, 542 So.2d 284 (Ala.Civ.App.1989). The question of probable cause being a jury question, the trial court properly refused Eubanks's motion for a directed verdict.
Eubanks last contends that the trial court erred in refusing to give one of his jury instructions. Specifically, the trial court refused Eubanks's request to charge the jury that in order to award punitive damages, the jury must find by "clear and convincing evidence" that he lacked probable cause to instigate criminal proceedings against Hall.
Eubanks cites Ala.Code 1975, § 12-21-12(a), in support of this contention; however, this section establishes the "substantial evidence" rule for testing the sufficiency of evidence in rulings by the trial court and does not apply to the instant case.
It appears that Eubanks intended to cite Ala.Code 1975, § 6-11-20, as requiring that the absence of probable cause be proven by clear and convincing evidence in awarding punitive damages. We find, however, that this statute requires "clear and convincing evidence" only for awarding punitive damages in cases of oppression, fraud, wantonness, or malice. Ala.Code 1975, § 6-11-20(a). Nowhere does this statute require that the absence of probable cause be proven by the same standard. Moreover, we find that the issue of punitive damages was properly submitted to the jury. See Delchamps, Inc. v. Larry, 613 So.2d 1235 (Ala.1992). A court cannot be reversed for its refusal to give a charge that is not expressed in the exact and appropriate terms of the law. Johnston v. Byrd, 279 Ala. 491, 187 So.2d 246 (1966). The trial court instructed the jury that it must be "reasonably satisf(ied)" that Eubanks had no probable cause to instigate the action against Hall, and this was not reversible error. See also Alabama Pattern Jury Instructions, § 24.05.
Based on the foregoing, we find that the judgment of the trial court is due to be affirmed.
AFFIRMED.

Robert A. Butterworth, Atty. Gen., Tallahassee, and Candance M. Sunderland, Asst. Atty. Gen., Tampa, for appellee.
PER CURIAM.
Appellant, James L. Percival, appeals the judgments and sentences entered in eight cases. We find that the trial court erred by requiring appellant's sentences to be served consecutively to an undetermined sentence to be imposed at an undetermined time in the future by a court in another county. We, accordingly, remand with instructions to strike that requirement from the judgments and sentences, but affirm in all other respects.
Appellant was originally placed on probation for two years in Hillsborough County after pleading nolo contendere to the charge of dealing in stolen property. Less than five months later, the state filed seven informations in Hillsborough County charging appellant with ten counts of robbery and one count of attempted robbery. Appellant pled nolo contendere to these charges in exchange for the trial court's agreement that he would not be sentenced to serve more than fifteen years in prison.
Although the guidelines scoresheet is not contained in the record, the record reveals that the prosecutor advised the trial court at sentencing that appellant's scoresheet reflected a presumptive sentence of twelve to seventeen years. Defense counsel neither disagreed with nor objected to the prosecutor's statement.
The trial court denied the state's request to depart from the presumptive sentence and, pursuant to its agreement with appellant, imposed five years imprisonment for dealing in stolen property and fifteen years imprisonment for each of the other eleven charges. All of the sentences were to be served concurrently. Over defense counsel's *67 objection, however, the trial court granted the state's request to require these sentences to be served consecutively to a sentence to be imposed at a later date on charges pending against appellant in Pinellas County. Appellant filed timely notices of appeal which have been consolidated for purposes of appeal.
We reject appellant's contention that we must remand for resentencing because there is no scoresheet in the record. Appellant's sentences were entered pursuant to an agreement with the trial court. See Lawson v. State, 497 So.2d 288 (Fla. 1st DCA 1986); Rowe v. State, 496 So.2d 857 (Fla. 2d DCA 1986), petition for review granted, No. 69-606 (Fla. March 20, 1987). Additionally, the record reflects that a scoresheet was prepared, that the trial court was informed of appellant's score and presumptive sentence, and that the trial court did not depart from the presumptive sentence. The mere absence of the scoresheet in the record is, therefore, irrelevant. See Davis v. State, 461 So.2d 1361 (Fla. 2d DCA), petition for review denied, 471 So.2d 43 (Fla. 1985).
We agree, however, with appellant's contention that the trial court erred in requiring his sentences to be served consecutively to a sentence which had not yet been imposed on other charges pending against him. The sentence imposed by a trial court must commence on a definite date, Keel v. State, 321 So.2d 86 (Fla. 2d DCA 1975), and may only be required to be served consecutively to an existing sentence. See Richardson v. State, 432 So.2d 750 (Fla. 2d DCA 1983); Teffeteller v. State, 396 So.2d 1171 (Fla. 5th DCA 1981).
In this case, the trial court did not know when, if ever, the Pinellas County sentence would be imposed or what length the sentence would be. Under these circumstances, the trial court erroneously ordered appellant's sentences to be served consecutively to an undetermined sentence to be imposed at an undetermined time in the future. We, accordingly, remand with instructions that the trial court strike that portion of appellant's sentences which requires the sentences to run consecutively to appellant's expected Pinellas County sentence. We affirm the judgments and sentences in all other respects.
Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.

Before HIGGINBOTHAM, GARZA, and ELROD, Circuit Judges.
PER CURIAM:*
        Sean C. Walker, Louisiana prisoner # 126912, appeals the dismissal of his
42 U.S.C. § 1983 complaint against numerous defendants, including the head of
administration of B.B. Sixty Rayburn Correctional Center (the head of
administration).      Walker asserted that the defendants were deliberately
indifferent to his safety and to his medical needs after he was attacked and

         Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not

R. 47.5.4.

                                  No. 11-30209

injured by his cellmate. The district court dismissed Walker’s complaint as
frivolous and/or for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted;
however, the judgment failed to mention Walker’s claims against the head of
administration, although it specifically dismissed Walker’s claims against the
other defendants.
      Under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, federal appellate courts have jurisdiction to hear
appeals from “‘final decisions’” of district courts. Witherspoon v. White, 111 F.3d
399, 401 (5th Cir. 1997). Generally, a judgment adjudicating the rights of fewer
than all of the parties is not a final decision in the absence of a Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 54(b) certification directing entry of final judgment as to those
parties. Federal Sav. & Loan Ins. Corp. v. Tullos-Pierremont, 894 F.2d 1469,
1471 (5th Cir. 1990). In circumstances in which a court order is ambiguous as
to what parties and claims are being disposed of and “the district court clearly
intend[ed] to effect a final dismissal of a claim, we will construe [the district
court’s] order accordingly, despite ambiguous language that might indicate
otherwise.” Picco v. Global Marine Drilling Co., 900 F.2d 846, 849 n. 4 (5th
Cir.1990).
      The head of administration was served with Walker’s complaint and
amended complaint; thus, he was a party to the suit. See Nagle v. Lee, 807 F.2d
435, 440 (5th Cir. 1987). Although the district court’s judgment was silent
regarding Walker’s claims against the head of administration, the court might
have intended that the judgment be final in light of the fact that the district
court also denied Walker’s motion for leave to amend the complaint to substitute
Robert C. Tanner as the head of administration because Walker had failed to
state a claim against Tanner. See Picco, 900 F.2d at 849 n. 4. We conclude that
we should order a limited remand to allow the district court to indicate whether
the judgment of February 2, 2011, was intended to be the final judgment in this
case, and if not, for the court to determine whether or not it now will enter a
final judgment.

                                     (October 2, 2006)

Before TJOFLAT and CARNES, Circuit Judges and HODGES,* District Judge.

CARNES, Circuit Judge:




       *
          Honorable William Terrell Hodges, United States District Judge for the Middle District
of Florida, sitting by designation.
                                          I.

      In March 1997 a grand jury indicted Gregorio Machado on thirteen counts of

conspiracy to launder drug proceeds. The indictment included a forfeiture count

pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 982. After reaching a plea agreement with the

government, Machado entered a guilty plea in May 1997. The written plea

agreement contained an appeal waiver provision and a detailed forfeiture provision

through which Machado pledged “to fully and unreservedly cooperate and assist

the United States in the forfeiture and recovery of the forfeited assets, portions

thereof, or their substitutes wherever located.” That provision included a detailed

list of all the money and items that were to be forfeited. Machado says that the

value of those listed items was approximately $12 million at the time of the

indictment.

      On July 28, 1997, the district court sentenced Machado to 51 months

imprisonment. At sentencing, the Assistant United States Attorney representing

the government moved to dismiss eleven of the thirteen counts of the indictment in

accordance with the plea agreement, and stated that “[t]he United States has not

dismissed Count I or the forfeiture count at the very end.” The court responded,

“Count II through XI[I] are dismissed. Count I and the forfeiture count remain in

full force and effect.” The formal judgment in the case, which was entered on July



                                           2
30, 1997, recited the numbers of the counts that had been dismissed, stated that the

defendant had pleaded guilty to Count 1, and accordingly adjudged him guilty of

conspiracy to launder money, and sentenced him to a term of 51 months. The only

mention of forfeiture in the judgment entry is this sentence: “A separate Forfeiture

order shall be entered in this cause.”

       On March 11, 1998, about seven months later the government filed a motion

for an order of forfeiture. The following day the district court granted the motion

and entered a preliminary order of forfeiture. On the government’s motion, the

district court on April 24, 1998 entered an amended order to include additional

property. A final order of forfeiture was entered on July 14, 1998, nearly a year

after sentencing. Machado did not attempt to appeal any of those orders, including

the final order of forfeiture.

       Instead, on September 4, 1998, about six weeks after entry of the final order,

he filed a pro se motion for return of property pursuant to Fed. R. Cr. P. 41(e),

requesting a return of “all documents and records seized or taken from the movant,

his businesses, and residence that were used as evidence in the criminal and

[forfeiture] actions.” In that motion Machado claimed that the documents he

sought would reveal that some of his property had been improperly forfeited. At a

hearing on January 20, 1999, the district court ordered the documents returned to



                                           3
Machado. The government could not fully comply because some of the original

documents were destroyed, but it ultimately returned others to Machado.

Machado filed a pro se motion for sanctions which was ultimately denied.

      On April 23, 2003, three months shy of five years after entry of the final

order of forfeiture, Machado filed under Rule 60(b)(4) a pro se motion for relief

from that order “in light of this Circuit’s decision in United States v. Petrie, 302

F.3d 1280, 1284–85 (11th Cir. 2002).” Machado contended that because the

district court had not entered the final order of forfeiture until twelve months after

he was sentenced, it lacked jurisdiction to do so, and for that reason the order must

be vacated. Because the district court had previously issued an order prohibiting

the parties from filing any new motions until all pending motions were resolved,

the district court denied that motion. Machado appealed, but we affirmed after

concluding that the denial of his Rule 60(b)(4) motion on that ground was not an

abuse of discretion. We never reached the merits of Machado’s claim.

      On May 17, 2004, Machado filed pursuant to Rule 60(b) another motion to

vacate the forfeiture order. After the district court denied that motion a week later,

we affirmed on November 17, 2004, explaining that Rule 60(b) cannot be used to

challenge criminal forfeiture orders. Again, we did not reach the merits of

Machado’s claim.



                                           4
      On December 17, 2004, which was six years and five months after the final

order of forfeiture was entered, Machado filed yet another pro se motion seeking

return of the forfeited property. This one asserted that he was proceeding under

Fed. R. Cr. P. 41(g) and the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a). In February 2005

the district court denied the motion in a three-sentence order: “This cause came

before the Court upon Defendant’s Motion for Return of Property Pursuant to Fed.

R. Crim. P. Rule 41(e) . . . filed December 17, 2004. The Court having reviewed

the pertinent portions of the record, and being otherwise fully advised in the

premises, it is ordered and adjudged that Defendant’s Motion for Return of

Property is Denied. Done and ordered in Chambers, at Miami, Florida this 7th Day

of February, 2005.” Thereafter Machado filed his notice of appeal, and we

appointed counsel to represent him.

                                           II.

      At the heart of all Machado’s arguments and efforts is his contention that the

district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter the final order of forfeiture

nearly a full year after the judgment incorporating the sentence had been entered.

Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(d)(2), which was in effect when Machado

was sentenced, stated that: “At sentencing, a final order of forfeiture shall be made

part of the sentence and included in the judgment.” Fed. R. Cr. P. 32(d)(2) (1997).



                                            5
Machado contends that the district court’s failure to comply with Rule 32(d)(2)

when it sentenced him on July 28, 1997 means that the court lost jurisdiction to

enter a forfeiture order, and did not have the power to do so when it attempted to

enter the order of forfeiture on July 14, 1998. The government’s position is that

Rule 32(d)(2) is not jurisdictional, and instead is a claim-processing rule that can

be forfeited if the party waits too long to raise the argument, as Machado did. See

United States v. Eberhart, _____ U.S. ____, ____, 126 S. Ct. 403, 405-07 (2005).

       We lack jurisdiction to decide the issue of whether the district court had

jurisdiction to belatedly enter the final order of forfeiture. Federal Rule of

Appellate Procedure 4 requires a criminal litigant who makes an appeal as of right

to file a notice of appeal “within 10 days after the later of . . . the entry of either the

judgment or the order being appealed . . . .” Fed. R. App. P. 4(b)(1)(A)(i). Under

that rule the district court may extend that ten day period by up to thirty days if a

party shows excusable neglect. Fed. R. App. P. 4(b)(4). Even if there is excusable

neglect the latest a defendant may wait before appealing a final order in a criminal

case is forty days after it was entered. See id.

       Filing a timely notice of appeal is “mandatory and jurisdictional” and if a

defendant fails to do so, a court of appeals is “without jurisdiction to review the

decision on the merits.” See Budinich v. Becton Dickinson and Co., 486 U.S. 196,



                                             6
203, 108 S. Ct. 1717, 1722 (1988); accord United States v. Cartwright, 413 F.3d

1295, 1299–1300 (11th Cir. 2005) (criminal defendant’s failure to file a timely

notice of appeal under Rule 4(b) requires dismissal for lack of jurisdiction); United

States v. Arevalo, 408 F.3d 1233, 1236 (9th Cir. 2005) (defendant’s “failure to file

a timely or effective notice of appeal renders us without jurisdiction to consider the

merits of the petitioner’s claims”); United States v. Hirsch, 207 F.3d 928, 930–31

(7th Cir. 2000) (if the notice of appeal is untimely the “appeal must be dismissed

for want of jurisdiction”); United States v. Rapoport, 159 F.3d 1, 2–3 (1st Cir.

1998) (same); United States v. Christunas, 126 F.3d 765, 768–69 (6th Cir. 1997)

(Rule 4(b) compliance “is a jurisdictional prerequisite which this court can neither

waive nor extend”); United States v. Marbley, 81 F.3d 51, 52 (7th Cir. 1996)

(same); United States v. Houser, 804 F.2d 565, 568 (9th Cir. 1986) (time limits on

filing a notice of appeal are “mandatory and jurisdictional”); United States v.

Whitaker, 722 F.2d 1533, 1534 (11th Cir. 1984) (“Failure to file a timely notice of

appeal leaves the appellate court without jurisdiction.”).

       The final order of forfeiture about which Machado complains was entered on

July 14, 1998 and the ten days he had to file his notice of appeal ran out on July 24,

1998.1 Assuming that the district court might somehow have found excusable


       1
          A preliminary order of forfeiture is a final and immediately appealable order if it
finally determines the defendant’s rights in the forfeited property. United States v. Gross, 213

                                                 7
neglect and granted Machado thirty more days for that reason, the last possible date

for filing the notice of appeal was August 23, 1998, which was forty days after the

district court entered the order. See Sanders v. United States, 113 F.3d 184, 186

(11th Cir. 1997). Machado missed that deadline. Indeed, he never filed a notice of

appeal from the order which he seeks to have set aside.

       Even if we agreed with Machado’s suggestion at oral argument that his Rule

41(e) motion for return of documents could be construed as an appeal from the

final order of forfeiture, it still came too late. The Rule 41(e) motion was filed on

September 4, 1998, well after the deadline for filing his notice of appeal. And even

if the deadline could have been extended under Rule 4(a)(5) for excusable neglect,

the maximum extension would have been thirty days, or until August 23, 1998, and

the notice of appeal came after that date.

       We are aware, of course, that “subject-matter jurisdiction . . . can never be

forfeited or waived” and “[c]onsequently, defects in subject-matter jurisdiction

require correction regardless of whether the error was raised in district court,”

United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625, 630, 122 S. Ct. 1781, 1785 (2002); see also


F.3d 599, 600 (11th Cir. 2000). However, in this case the preliminary order was amended to
include additional property and so did not finally determine Machado’s interest in all the
property. Thus, Machado’s time for appeal in this case ran from the entry of the final order of
forfeiture on July 14, 1998. Cf. Christunas, 126 F.3d at 768–69 (refusing to consider for lack of
jurisdiction a criminal defendants’ appeal from a final order of forfeiture holding that he should
have timely appealed in accordance with Rule 4(b) the preliminary order of forfeiture because it
was final as to him).

                                                 8
Arbaugh v. Y& H Corp., ___ U.S. ___, ___, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 1240 (2006) (“The

objection that a federal court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction . . . may be raised by

a party, or by a court on its own initiative, at any stage in the litigation, even after

trial and the entry of judgment.”). That principle is not, however, an exception to

the requirements for appellate jurisdiction, and if those requirements are not met

we cannot review whether a judgment is defective, not even where the asserted

defect is that the district court lacked jurisdiction. Arbaugh does not hold or

intimate that concerns about the district court’s jurisdiction to enter an order or

judgment trump a lack of appellate jurisdiction to review a district court judgment.

Neither Arbaugh nor any other binding decision holds that a court of appeals

always has appellate jurisdiction to decide whether the district court had

jurisdiction. Otherwise, an appeal could be filed months, years, or even decades

late. See Des Moines Navigation & R.R. Co. v. Iowa Homestead Co., 123 U.S.

552, 8 S. Ct. 217 (1887) (upholding the res judicata effect of a prior decision in

spite of the argument that the court lacked jurisdiction to render a judgment in the

prior case); United States v. Valadez-Camarena, 402 F.3d 1259, 1260–61 (10th

Cir. 2005) (rejecting a jurisdictional challenge to a final conviction and sentence

and refusing to consider the merits because the case was no longer pending for

purposes of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(b)(3)); United States v.



                                             9
Hartwell, 448 F.3d 707, 720–21 (4th Cir. 2006) (Williams, J., concurring) (noting

that when a criminal defendant failed to file a direct appeal “his conviction and

sentence became insulated from jurisdictional challenge except in a collateral

proceeding, such as a proceeding under 28 U.S.C.A. § 2255” and the conviction

and sentence must be treated as valid for subsequent motions);

                                         III.

      Although we lack jurisdiction to review whether the district court had

jurisdiction to enter the final order of forfeiture in July 1998, we do have

jurisdiction to review whether the district court erred in denying his Rule 41(g)

motion for return of property in February of 2005. The difference is that

Machado did file a timely notice of appeal from the order denying that Rule 41(g)

motion. We review de novo the attendant legal issues, United States v. Howell,

425 F.3d 971, 973 (11th Cir. 2005), but we review the equitable equation of the

district court’s decision to deny a Rule 41(g) motion only for abuse of discretion.

See id. at 974 (citing Gaudiosi v. Mellon, 269 F.2d 873, 881–82 (3d Cir.1959)

(reviewing for abuse of discretion the district court’s decision to apply the

equitable doctrine of unclean hands)); United States v. Bennett, 423 F.3d 271, 274

(3d Cir. 2005) (“In most Rule 41(g) cases demanding return of forfeited property,

we review the District Court’s decision to exercise its equitable jurisdiction for



                                          10
abuse of discretion.” (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)).

      Rule 41(g) states: “A person aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure of

property or by the deprivation of property may move for the property’s return. The

motion must be filed in the district where the property was seized.” Fed. R. Cr. P.

41(g). The district court can exercise equitable jurisdiction over a Rule 41(g)

motion filed after criminal proceedings have ended. United States v. Martinez, 241

F.3d 1329, 1329 (11th Cir. 2001). “[I]n order for a district court to grant a Rule

41(g) motion, the owner of the property must have clean hands.” Howell, 425 F.3d

at 974.

      The district court properly denied Machado’s Rule 41(g) motion, because

the exercise of equitable jurisdiction in his favor would be inequitable. It would

return to a criminal the fruits of his crimes, giving him an illicit multi-million

dollar windfall. It would give back to him property that he voluntarily forfeited to

the government as part of a valid plea agreement, an agreement which gave him

ample consideration in return. Having gotten the full benefit of his bargain, it

would be inequitable to allow Machado to escape the burdens.

      Even if Machado were not barred by equitable principles from obtaining the

relief he seeks, his claim would be time barred. “When an owner invokes Rule

41(g) after the close of all criminal proceedings, the court treats the motion for



                                           11
return of property as a civil action in equity.” Howell, 425 F.3d at 974. Civil

actions filed against the government are subject to a six year statute of limitation.

28 U.S.C. § 2401(a) (“[E]very civil action commenced against the United States

shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of action

first accrues.”). Because Rule 41(g) actions filed after the close of the criminal

proceedings are treated as civil actions, they are subject to the six year statute of

limitation in § 2401(a). See United States v. Sims, 376 F.3d 705, 708–09 (7th Cir.

2004) (holding that § 2401(a) applies to a Rule 41(g) motion); United States v.

Wright, 361 F.3d 288, 290 (5th Cir. 2004) (same); United States v. Rodriguez

Aguirre, 264 F.3d 1195, 1210 (10th Cir. 2001) (same); United States v. Minor, 228

F.3d 352, 359 (4th Cir. 2000) (same); Clymore v. United States, 217 F.3d 370, 373

(5th Cir. 2000) (same).

      A legal claim is not like a fine wine that gets better with age. It is more like

milk, which spoils after its expiration date. The six-year statute of limitations

began to run when the final order of forfeiture was entered against Machado on

July 14, 1998. His December 17, 2004 Rule 41(g) motion offered up a claim that

had been rendered legally unpalatable by the passage of time.

                                          IV.

      The All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a), adds nothing to Machado’s case. It



                                           12
provides that: “The Supreme Court and all courts established by Act of Congress

may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions

and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.” 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a). The

Supreme Court has instructed that this source of federal court power must only be

used in “extraordinary circumstances.” Kerr v. U.S. Dist. Court for N. Dist. of

Cal., 426 U.S. 394, 403, 96 S. Ct. 2119, 2124 (1976). As the Court has explained:

“The All Writs Act is a residual source of authority to issue writs that are not

otherwise covered by statute. Where a statute specifically addresses the particular

issue at hand, it is that authority, and not the All Writs Act, that is controlling.

Although that Act empowers federal courts to fashion extraordinary remedies when

the need arises, it does not authorize them to issue ad hoc writs whenever

compliance with statutory procedures appears inconvenient or less appropriate.”

Pa. Bureau of Corr. v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 474 U.S. 34, 43, 106 S. Ct. 355, 361

(1985). As we put it two years ago, “[t]he Act does not create any substantive

federal jurisdiction,” but instead it is only “a codification of the federal courts’

traditional, inherent power to protect the jurisdiction they already have, derived

from some other source.” Klay v. United Healthgroup, Inc., 376 F.3d 1092,

1099–1100 (11th Cir. 2004).

      The district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to exercise



                                            13
jurisdiction under the All Writs Act. This is not an extraordinary case that merits

use of extraordinary authority. Machado had adequate remedies available to him.

He could have timely appealed the final order of forfeiture in accordance with

appellate Rule 4(b). Another procedure which supplies jurisdiction to determine

whether this type of relief should be granted is Rule 41(g). As we have already

explained, because Machado’s claim seeks relief that would not be equitable, and

because he waited too late to file his Rule 41(g) motion, his claim cannot succeed

under that provision. We will not use the All Writs Act as a fix all provision to

plug up holes in a party’s position, holes through which any claim to relief has

drained out.

                                          V.

      Finally, Machado asserts that the order of forfeiture violates his due process

and double jeopardy rights and that we should fashion an equitable remedy to

correct those violations. Machado does not have a valid due process or double

jeopardy claim, and even if he did he would not have a viable procedural basis

through which to assert it. The law provides appeals for the purpose of raising

claims like these, and he failed to appeal.

      AFFIRMED.

CANDLER, Justice.
(After stating the foregoing facts.) 1. There is set out above a copy of the enrolled act as attached to and made a part of the petition as amended. As enrolled the act shows on its face that taxation on wines is included in the title and in the body. The plaintiffs in error contend that there were irregularities during the process of the legislation such as to controvert any valid reference to wines in the title. A portion of the petition as amended alleges in substance that the words, "to increase the excise taxes upon domestic wines, foreign wines, and domestic and foreign fortified wines," were neither read before nor voted on by the legislature nor did they appear in the title when the bill was before the legislature. Instead, it is contended that those words were composed and inserted by some agency or method other than the joint action of the two houses after the bill was voted on and passed. Further, it is contended that the words, "and that the caption be amended accordingly," were written underneath the body of the amendment, but that the same were not constitutionally sufficient to authorize the first above-quoted words which were written into the title. The petition as amended attempts to show the facts relied on by photostatic copies of the bill, its amendment during process of passage, and Legislative Journal entries. Involved in these contentions there are several provisions of the *484 State Constitution, alleged to be violated, as follows: article III, section 1, paragraph 1 (Code, Ann. § 2-1301), reading: "The legislative power of the State shall be vested in a General Assembly which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives," the contention being that the alleged new matter inserted in the manner alleged constitutes an unlawful delegation of legislative authority in violation thereof; article III, section VII, paragraph VII (Code, Ann. § 2-1907), reading: "Every bill, before it shall pass, shall be read three times, and on three separate days, in each House, unless in cases of actual invasion, or insurrection, but the first and second reading of each local bill, shall consist of the reading of the title only, unless said bill is ordered to be engrossed," it being contended that, the entire act not being read, this clause was violated; article III, section VII, paragraph VII (Code, Ann. § 2-1908), reading: "No law shall pass which refers to more than one subject matter, or contains matter different from what is expressed in the title thereof," the contention in this connection being that the act having made reference in the body to wines, without having reference to the same in the title, is in violation of this provision; and article I, section I, paragraph III (Code, Ann. § 2-103), reading: "No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, except by due process of law," it being contended that the legislature undertook to have the caption changed after the act passed and did so in terms so vague, uncertain, and indefinite as not to apprise anyone thereof.
Before a determination of the questions above presented, it is obvious that consideration must be given to the effect thereon of the decisions of this court on the principle commonly known as the conclusive presumption of an enrolled act. In Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. State, 135 Ga. 545 (69 S. E. 725), it was held: "A duly enrolled act properly authenticated by the regular presiding officers of both houses of the General Assembly, approved by the Governor, and deposited with the Secretary of State as an existing law, will be conclusively presumed to have been enacted in accordance with the constitutional requirements; and it is not permissible to show, by the legislative journals or other records, that it did not receive on its passage a majority vote of all the members elected to each house, or that there was *485 any irregularity in its enactment." See also DeLoach v. Newton, 134 Ga. 739 (68 S. E. 708), and Williams v. MacFeeley, 186 Ga. 145 (197 S. E. 225). A case cited and relied on by the plaintiffs in error is Solomon v. Commissioners of Cartersville, 41 Ga. 157. It held that an act of the General Assembly signed by Rufus B. Bullock, Governor, May 26, 1869, was invalid because it was not signed within the time prescribed by the Constitution. The Solomon case, supra, was cited in DeLoach v. Newton, supra, and the court, after discussing the possible uses of the legislative journals, said: "A possible use for them might arise on the construction of an act. In Solomon v. Commissioners of Cartersville, 41 Ga. 157, the journals of the General Assembly were consulted to ascertain when the legislature adjourned. In Gormley v. Taylor, 44 Ga. 76, a query was put on this subject." Evidently the court in DeLoach v. Newton, supra, did not consider the case of Solomon v. Commissioners of Cartersville, supra, any obstacle to reaching its decision. Neither do we, in this case, find anything in it to prevent us from following DeLoach v. Newton, Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. State, and Williams v. MacFeeley (supra), in circumstances where, as in the present case, the attempt is to impeach a legislative act in reference to matters alleged to have transpired before the signing of the bill by the Governor, and where the issue is not whether or not the Governor did actually sign the bill within the time required by the Constitution. The plaintiffs in error argue that the decided cases in this State on the question of conclusive presumption of an enrolled act do not, as to any of them, embrace a situation exactly like that presented by the facts in the instant case. If not in exact detail with the facts here involved, the principles in the cited cases upholding the conclusive presumption doctrine are sufficiently controlling for us to adhere to the same rule in this case. Thus, we reach the conclusion that where, as in this case, a copy of an enrolled act purporting to contain the signatures of the Speaker of the House, Clerk of the House, President of the Senate, Secretary of the Senate, and the Governor, is set out and made a part of the amended petition, which seeks to show invalidity upon the contention that a portion of the title was composed and inserted by some method or agency in an irregular manner during the process of its passage, neither the *486 legislative journals nor photostatic copies of the bill are permissible to impeach the act, because of the conclusive presumption against any irregularity in its enactment; and, accordingly, this court cannot consider violations of the State Constitution that are dependent on being so shown.
2. The act is assailed as being in violation of article III, section VII, paragraph VIII of the State Constitution (Code, Ann. § 2-1908), particularly the portion thereof reading, "No law shall pass which refers to more than one subject matter," because, as the plaintiffs in error contend, it embraces legislation on "malt beverages" and "wines." Specifically it is contended that the regulation, control, and taxation of malt beverages is a separate subject-matter from that of wines. Seeking to illustrate, it is insisted that they have been dealt with as a separate series of legislation; that in certain court decisions the term "malt beverages" has been held not to include "wines"; that legislative declarations in the wine act of 1935, to the effect that the same was to promote temperance and prosperity of the people of Georgia and foster the growing of grapes, fruits, and berries on Georgia farms, indicate that wines are recognized by the legislature as being in a different subject-matter category from that of malt beverages; and that executive and administrative treatment has recognized them as separate. The "subject" of an act, within the meaning of the constitutional provision that no act shall contain more than one subject, is regarded as the matter or thing forming the groundwork of the act. Lloyd v. Richardson, 158 Ga. 633 (124 S. E. 37); 50 Am. Jr. 172, § 191; Mayes v. Daniel, 186 Ga. 345, 353 (198 S. E. 535). In Whitley v. State, 134 Ga. 758 (68 S. E. 716), involving an act of 1907 to prohibit the manufacture, sale, and other things relating to various named forms of alcoholic liquors or drinks, the dual subject-matter provision of the State Constitution was invoked and held not to be applicable, it being pointed out that "all these things were germane to and formed a part of the general purpose of the act. They were not so entirely distinct and different as to constitute different subject-matters within the meaning of the paragraph of the constitution." See also Carroll v. Wright, 131 Ga. 728 (63 S. E. 260). Looking to the language of the act in the instant case, the general purpose is illustrated by words and figures *487 that unmistakably stand out as indicating that an increase in excise taxes is the thing chiefly sought. Whatever may have been the reasons prompting the legislature in the year 1935 to deal separately with malt beverages (Ga. L. 1935, pp. 73-81) and wines (Ga. L. 1935, pp. 492-4), or amending the same separately afterwards, it does not appear to us that the terms, "malt beverages" and "wines" are so incongruous per se that they could not be dealt with in a single act for a purpose that was applicable. Although the original wine act of 1935 legalized the making of domestic wines and exempted from taxation wine made from Georgia grapes, fruits, and berries, the tax-free provision was eliminated by an act approved March 30, 1937 (Ga. L. 1937, p. 851), and a tax was prescribed to be levied and collected on domestic wines and foreign wines graduated on alcoholic content. Since that time the amended act has contained levies of taxes upon wines of all classes, and the original theory of tax exemption on wine made from Georgia grapes, fruits, and berries has no longer obtained. It is true that the levies against wines made from Georgia products have been at a lower rate than other wines. Rationally, however, the declarations in the original wine act of 1935, to the effect that promotion of temperance and prosperity for Georgia people and to foster and encourage the growing of grapes, fruits, and berries in Georgia, were more in harmony with the act when it first legalized domestic wines with a limited alcoholic content, without taxes, than now apply since the amendments letting in foreign as well as domestic wines and permitting an increased alcoholic content. The question in McKown v. Atlanta, 184 Ga. 221 (190 S. E. 571), and McCaffrey v. State, 183 Ga. 827 (189 S. E. 825), was whether a law or ordinance pertaining to "malt beverages" comprehended "wines" within that term. No such issue is involved here, and those cases are not applicable. In view of the foregoing, the act now under consideration does not contain a dual subject-matter within the meaning of the constitutional provision that no act shall contain more than one subject.
3. The plaintiffs in error contend that section 2-a of the act unconstitutionally discriminates against them, in that a tax of $1 per gallon is levied on wine manufactured in Georgia from out-of-State grapes as against a ten-cents-per-gallon levy on *488 wine of the same class manufactured from Georgia raw materials. The constitutional provisions alleged to be violated are as follows: denial of due process and equal protection as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, especially that portion thereof reading, "nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law"; nor deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws"; and burdening interstate commerce, as forbidden by article 1, section 8, paragraph 3, especially the portion reading: "The Congress shall have Power . . . To regulate commerce . . among the several States." It is insisted that the definition of foreign wines, making applicable the taxation, illustrates the unconstitutionality claimed. The definition reads: "Foreign wines are hereby defined and declared to be wines which are imported in whole or in part in the State of Georgia or manufactured in the State of Georgia from products imported in whole or in part from without the State and produced by natural fermentation." The United States Supreme Court has held in State Board of Equalization v. Young's Market Co., 299 U. S. 57 (57 Sup. Ct. 77, 81 L. ed. 38), Mahoney v. Joseph Triner Corp., 304 U. S. 401 (58 Sup. Ct. 952, 82 L. ed. 1424), and Indianapolis Brewing Co. v. Liquor Control Commission of the State of Michigan, 305 U. S. 391 (59 Sup. Ct. 254, 83 L. ed. 243), that the Twenty-first Amendment to the Constitution of the United States renders inoperative asserted violations of such provisions as due process, equal protection, and interstate commerce, where State action within the subject-matter of the Twenty-first Amendment is involved. Beer and beer dealers were involved in the alleged discrimination in the Indianapolis Brewing Co. case, supra.
Upon the basis of the Twenty-first Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, this court in Scott v. State, 187 Ga. 702 (2 S. E. 2d, 65), held that a statute imposing a tax on distilled spirits imported into the State and making it a misdemeanor to possess unstamped liquor did not violate the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution on the ground that it prohibited purchase of distilled spirits outside of the State for the purchaser's own use. The plaintiffs in error cite U. S. v. Frankfort Distilleries, 324 U. S. 293 (65 Sup. Ct. 661, 89 L. ed. 951), *489 and Jatros v. Bowles, 143 Fed. 2d, 453, and claim the same as authority for their contention that the Twenty-first Amendment does not immunize the portion of the act involved from the effect of the commerce clause. The Frankfort Distilleries case, supra, involved an alleged conspiracy in fixing prices in violation of the Sherman Act, and it was pointed out that it was not being enforced in that case in such manner as to conflict with the law of Colorado. Jatros v. Bowles, supra, involved Emergency War Price controls which rested under the war powers. Neither of the two last-mentioned cases conflicts with the right of the State's authority to determine conditions upon which liquor can come into its territory and what will be done with it after it gets there. Therefore, they are not applicable to the question here. Mason v. State, 1 Ga. App. 534 (5) (58 S. E. 139), holds that "wine" is included in the definition of the term "intoxicating liquors." The Twenty-first Amendment embraces "wine" such as is the subject-matter dealt with in the portion of the act under attack in this case. If the portion of the act is discriminatory, it is outside the pale of protection of the due-process and equal-protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution by reason of the Twenty-first Amendment thereof. Therefore, we cannot consider the grounds of discrimination and unconstitutionality which are raised by the plaintiffs in error and discussed in this division of the opinion.
(a) Likewise, there is no merit in the contention here made that section 2-a of the act of 1949 (Ga. L. 1949, Ex. Sess. p. 5) offends article 1, section 1, paragraph 2 of the Constitution of 1945 (Code, Ann., § 2-102), which declares "Protection to person and property is the paramount duty of government, and shall be impartial and complete."
4. In view of the above rulings, there was no error in sustaining the general demurrers, which attacked the petition as amended on grounds that no cause of action was set out, nor did the allegations warrant the granting of the equitable relief prayed. Because of said rulings on these general demurrers, it becomes unnecessary to pass on the special demurrers brought up by the cross-bill of exceptions.
Judgment affirmed on the main bill of exceptions. All the *490 Justices concur, except Wyatt and Head, JJ., who dissent from division 2 of the opinion and the judgment of affirmance, Duckworth, C. J., and Almand J., concur specially. Cross-bill of exceptions dismissed. All the Justices concur.
ALMAND, Justice. I concur in the ruling in division 1 of the opinion only because of prior unanimous decisions of this court, cited in the opinion. I think that these previous decisions are wrong and should be overruled, but since a sufficient number of members of the present court to overrule these cases do not agree with me, I am bound by these prior rulings. I am authorized to say that Chief Justice Duckworth concurs in this special concurrence.

BOTANY WORSTED MILLS
v.
UNITED STATES.
No. 31.
Supreme Court of United States.
Submitted April 23, 1928.
Argued November 20, 1928.
Decided January 2, 1929.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
*283 Mr. Nathan A. Smyth for petitioner.
Solicitor General Mitchell for the United States.
*284 A brief on behalf of Mr. A.G. Lacy, as amicus curiae, was filed by special leave of Court on motion of the Solicitor General.
MR. JUSTICE SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Botany Worsted Mills, a New Jersey corporation engaged in the manufactured of woolen and worsted fabrics, made a return of its net income for the taxable year 1917 under the Revenue Act of 1916[1] and the War Revenue Act of 1917.[2] By § 12(a) of the Revenue Act it was provided that in ascertaining the net income of a corporation organized in the United States there should be deducted from its gross income all "the ordinary and necessary expenses paid within the year in the maintenance and operation of its business and properties." Under this provision the Mills deducted amounts aggregating $1,565,739.39 paid as compensation to the members of its board of directors, in addition to salaries of $9,000 each. It paid an income tax computed in accordance with this return. Thereafter, in 1920, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed an additional income tax against it. Of this, $450,994.06 was attributable to his disallowance of $783,656.06 of the deduction claimed as compensation paid to the directors, on the ground that the total amount paid as compensation was unreasonable and the remainder of the deduction as allowed represented fair and reasonable compensation. The Mills, after paying the additional tax, filed a claim for refund of this $450,994.06. The claim was disallowed; and the Mills thereafter, in September 1924, by a petition in the Court of Claims sought to recover this sum from the United States, with *285 interest  alleging that the disallowance of part of the compensation paid the directors was illegal.[3] After a hearing on the merits the court, upon its findings of fact, dismissed the petition upon the ground that the additional tax was imposed under an agreement of settlement which prevented a recovery. 63 C. Cls. 405. And this writ of certiorari was granted.
The first question presented is whether the Mills is precluded from recovering the amount claimed by reason of a settlement.
Sec. 3229 of the Revised Statutes,[4] provides that: "The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the advice and consent of the Secretary of the Treasury, may compromise any civil or criminal case arising under the internal-revenue laws instead of commencing suit thereon; and, with the advice and consent of the said Secretary and the recommendation of the Attorney-General, he may compromise any such case after a suit thereon has been commenced. Whenever a compromise is made in any case there shall be placed on file in the office of the Commissioner the opinion of the Solicitor of Internal Revenue, . . . with his reasons therefor, with a statement of *286 the amount of tax assessed, . . . and the amount actually paid in accordance with the terms of the compromise."[5]
The Government did not claim that there had been a compromise under this statute, but contended in the Court of Claims that, irrespective thereof, an agreement of settlement had been entered into between the Mills and the Commissioner under which the Mills had accepted the partial disallowance as to the compensation paid the directors, and had also received concessions as to other disputed items the benefit of which it still enjoyed, and was therefore estopped from seeking a recovery.
As to this matter the findings of fact show that after the Mills had paid the amount of the tax shown by its original return, an investigation of its books disclosed to the Commissioner the necessity of making an additional assessment, to be determined by the settlement of questions relating to the compensation (or, as it was termed, bonus) paid to the directors, depreciation charged off on its books, and reserves charged to expenses. After much correspondence and numerous conferences extending over several months between the attorney and assistant treasurer of the Mills and the chief of the special audit section of the Bureau of Internal Revenue and other of his official associates, a compromise was agreed to as to all the differences, by which the amounts to be allowed as reasonable compensation to the directors and as depreciation were agreed upon, and the claim as to reserve was allowed. Thereupon the Mills prepared and filed an amended return based upon the figures agreed upon in the conferences, with documentary evidence which it had *287 agreed to furnish; and the additional assessment was made in accordance with this return.[6]
The court, in sustaining the Government's contention, said: "With the payment of the tax under the circumstances surrounding this case the agreement, which is mentioned in the record as a `gentleman's agreement,' became in legal effect an executed contract of settlement"; and that, as the Mills was seeking to recover to account of the particular item which it regarded as unfavorable to its interests, and at the same time hold to the advantage derived from the settlement of other items in dispute involved in the same general settlement, it should not be allowed a recovery.
The Mills contends that the Commissioner had not been given, at the time in question, any authority, either in express terms or by implication, to compromise tax cases except as provided in § 3229; that this statute in granting such authority under specific limitations as to the method to be pursued, negatived his authority to effect a valid and binding agreement in any other way; that as the Government could not have been estopped by the unauthorized transactions of its officials, the Mills likewise could not be estopped thereby; and further, that the findings are insufficient to establish an estoppel.
The Government does not here challenge any of these contentions. In the brief for the United States filed in this Court the Solicitor General states that the question whether such an informal adjustment of taxes as was made in this case is binding on the taxpayer, is submitted for decision in deference to the opinion of the Court of Claims and the importance of the question  but no argument is made in support of the Government's previous contention that the Mills was estopped from questioning *288 the settlement. And, on the contrary, it is stated that  "Before and since the date of the alleged settlement in this case Congress has evidently proceeded on the theory that no adjustment of a tax controversy between representatives of the Bureau of Internal Revenue and a taxpayer is binding unless made with the formalities and with the approval of the officials prescribed by statute. The authority of officers of the United States to compromise claims on behalf of or against the United States in strictly limited. . . The statutes which authorize conclusive agreements and settlements to be made in particular ways and with the approval of designated officers raise the inference that adjustments or settlements made in other ways are not binding." And further, that "No ground for the United States to claim estoppel is disclosed in the findings."
Independently of these concessions, we are of the opinion that the informal settlement made in this case did not constitute a binding agreement. Sec. 3229 authorizes the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to compromise tax claims before suit, with the advice and consent of the Secretary of the Treasury, and requires that an opinion of the Solicitor of Internal Revenue setting forth the compromise be filed in the Commissioner's office. Here the attempted settlement was made by subordinate officials in the Bureau of Internal Revenue. And although it may have been ratified by the Commissioner in making the additional assessment based thereon, it does not appear that it was assented to by the Secretary, or that the opinion of the Solicitor was filed in the Commissioner's office.
We think that Congress intended by the statute to prescribed the exclusive method by which tax cases could be compromised, requiring therefor the concurrence of the Commissioner and the Secretary, and prescribing the formality with which, as a matter of public concern, it should be attested in the files of the Commissioner's office; *289 and did not intend to intrust the final settlement of such matters to the informal action of subordinate officials in the Bureau. When a statute limits a thing to be done in a particular mode, it includes the negative of any other mode. Raleigh, etc. R.R. Co. v. Reid, 13 Wall. 269, 270; Scott v. Ford, 52 Ore. 288, 296.
It is plain that no compromise is authorized by this statute which is not assented to by the Secretary of the Treasury. Leach v. Nichols (C.C.A.) 23 F. (2d) 275, 277. For this reason, if for no other the informal agreement made in this case did not constitute a settlement which in itself was binding upon the Government or the Mills. And, without determining whether such an agreement, though not binding in itself, may when executed become, under some circumstances, binding on the parties by estoppel, it suffices to say that here the findings disclose no adequate ground for any claim of estoppel by the United States.
We therefore conclude that the Mills was not precluded by the settlement from recovering any portion of the tax to which it may otherwise have been entitled.
This brings us to the question whether on the findings of fact the Mills is entitled to recover the portion of the additional tax attributable to the disallowance of $783,656.06 of the amount paid to the directors which it had claimed as a deduction.[7]
Under § 12(a) of the Revenue Act of 1916 the Mills was not entitled to this deduction unless the amount paid constituted a part of its "ordinary and necessary expenses" in the maintenance and operation of its business and properties. And in this suit the burden of establishing *290 that fact rested upon it, in order to show that it was entitled to the deduction which the Commissioner had disallowed, and that the additional tax was to that extent illegally assessed. The Court of Claims, however, made no finding that the amount disallowed by the Commissioner constituted a part of the ordinary and necessary expenses of the Mills. The findings are silent as to this ultimate fact  essential to a recovery by the Mills  and only show certain circumstantial facts relating to the payment made to the board of directors.
Where the Court of Claims does not make a finding upon the ultimate question of fact upon which the rights of the parties depend, but merely makes findings as to subsidiary circumstantial facts which bear upon it, such findings will not support a judgment unless the circumstantial facts as found are such that the ultimate fact follows from them as a necessary inference and may be held to result as a conclusion of law. See United States v. Pugh, 99 U.S. 265, 269; Winton v. Amos, 255 U.S. 373, 395.
The findings show that for many years it has been the practice of many corporations engaged in the woolen manufacturing business to base the compensation of the directors and executive officers upon a percentage of profits. Upon the organization of the Mills in 1890 the stockholders adopted a by-law providing that at the close of the business year the net profits should be distributed by paying a dividend of 6 per cent to stockholders and applying the balance remaining as follows: (a) placing 5 per cent in a reserve fund; (b) paying 25 per cent "As a bonus to the board of directors"; and (c) paying 70 per cent as additional dividend to the stockholders. The stockholders amended this by-law in 1903 by increasing the bonus of the board of directors to 40 per cent; in 1905, by providing, instead of a "bonus," that "compensation" *291 equal to 40 per cent should be "paid to the board of directors for their services"; and in 1908, by reducing such compensation to 32 per cent [that is 30.08 per cent of the net profits.] This by-law remained in force until after the taxable year 1917; and during the entire period "compensation" was paid to the directors in accordance therewith. From the outset the determination of the total amount of profit and of the aggregate amount payable to the board of directors was made by the board itself; and it likewise determined the basis of the apportionment among the several directors of the aggregate amount payable to the board as a whole. No contract was made with any director as to what his compensation should be other than such as was implied from his election and service as a member of the board in accordance with the by-law and the customary practices of the company, which each knew. At all times each director also held a position as an executive officer or manager of a department of the Mills.
The gross assets of the Mills increased from $1,114,149.63 in 1890 to $28,893,777.12 in 1917; and its net assets, including reserves, from $37,136.35 to $10,999,862.48. Its net income increased from $784,334.44 in 1910 to $7,953,512.80 in 1917; and the amount paid the directors in pursuance of the by-law increased, with some fluctuations, from $268,444.19 in 1910, to $400,935.18 in 1915, $693,617.16 in 1916, and $1,565,739.39 in 1917.[8] In 1917 there were the members of the board, so that if the total amount had been apportioned ratably, each would have received $156,573.93. And in that year each member of the board, in addition to the part of the aggregate in fact apportioned to him individually, also received a salary of $9,000.
*292 The findings do not show the nature or extent of the services rendered by the board of directors or its individual members, either as directors, executive officers or department managers  the amounts apportioned and paid to each director  the basis of apportionment, whether the nature and extent of their individual services, the amount of their stockholdings, or otherwise  the value of their services  or the reasonableness of the purported compensation.
We do not find it necessary to determine here whether the amounts paid by a corporation to its officers as compensation for their services cannot be allowed as "ordinary and necessary expenses" within the meaning of § 12 (a), merely because, and to the extent that, as compensation, they are unreasonable in amount.[9] However this may be, it is clear that extraordinary, unusual and extravagant amounts paid by a corporation to its officers in the guise and form of compensation for their services, but having no substantial relation to the measure of their services and being utterly disproportioned to their value, are not in reality payment for services, and cannot be regarded as "ordinary and necessary expenses" within the meaning of the section; and that such amounts do not become part of the "ordinary and necessary expenses" merely because the payments are made in accordance with an agreement between the corporation and its officers. Even if binding upon the parties, such an agreement does not change the character of the purported compensation or constitute it, as against the Government, an ordinary and necessary expense. Compare 20 Treas. Dec., Int. Rev., 330; Jacobs & Davies v. Anderson (C.C.A.), 228 Fed. 505, 506; *293 United States v. Philadelphia Knitting Mills Co. (C.C.A.), 273 Fed. 657, 658; and Becker Bros. v. United States (C.C.A.), 7 F. (2d) 3, 6.
In the light of this principle it is clear that the findings do not show, as a matter of necessary inference resulting as a conclusion of law, that the amount paid the directors in excess of the $782,083.33 allowed by the Commissioner,[10] constituted part of the ordinary and necessary expenses of the Mills. On the contrary, as this amount so greatly exceeded the amounts which, as a matter of common knowledge, are usually paid to directors for their attendance at meetings of the board and the discharge of their customary duties, and was much greater than the amounts that had been paid in prior years,[11] and as there is no showing as to the amounts paid the individual directors, in addition to the salaries of $9,000 which each received  presumably for his service as an executive officer or department manager  or as to the nature, extent or value of their services, the findings raise a strong inference that the unusual and extraordinary amount paid to the directors was not in fact compensation for their services, but merely a distribution of a fixed percentage of the net profits that had no relation to the services rendered.
Therefore, as the Mills has not sustained the burden of showing that the amount disallowed by the Commissioner was in fact part of its ordinary and necessary expenses, the judgment must, for this reason, be
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES agrees with the result.

[3]   Sec. 3226 of the Revised Statutes had been previously amended by § 1318 of the Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 227, 314, c. 136, so as to provide that no suit or proceeding should be maintained in any court for the recovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected until a claim for refund or credit had been duly filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue; and further amended by § 1014(a) of the Revenue Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 253, 343, c. 234, so as to provide that such suit or proceeding might be maintained, whether or not such tax had been paid under protest or duress. And the right of the Mills to maintain this suit, although the tax had not been paid under protest or duress, is not questioned by the Government.
[4]   U.S.C., Tit. 26, § 158.
[5]   Since the date of the settlement here involved §§ 1312 and 1313 of the Revenue Act of 1921, § 1006 of the Revenue Act of 1924, and § 1106(b) of the Revenue Act of 1926 have dealt specifically with agreements in writing made by a taxpayer and the Commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary, that the previous determination and assessment of a tax shall be final and conclusive.
[6]   The findings indicate inferentially that some tax claims of the Mills for two other years were also included in the settlement; but the precise facts do not appear.
[7]   This is claimed in the brief filed for the Mills; and in the oral argument its counsel specifically stated that the Mills relied on the sufficiency of the findings and made no request that the case be remanded to the Court of Claims for additional findings, as the Solicitor General had suggested.
[8]   The figures for some other years are also given in tabulated statements included in the findings.
[9]   Later, by § 214(a) of the Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 1057, c. 18, it was specifically provided that the "ordinary and necessary expenses" should include "a reasonable allowance for salaries or other compensation for personal services actually rendered."
[10]   The amount allowed, it may be noted, was, in itself, $481,934.02 more than the average of the amounts that had been paid in the seven years immediately preceding, and $88,466.17 more than the greatest amount that had been paid in any one year.

Application of Albert BOWERS and James C. Orr.
Patent Appeal No. 7584.
United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.
May 12, 1966.

Evelyn K. Merker, Leon Simon, Washington, D. C., for appellants.
Clarence W. Moore, Washington, D. C. (Jack E. Armore, Washington, D. C., of counsel), for Commissioner of Patents.
Before RICH, Acting Chief, MARTIN, SMITH, and ALMOND, Judges, and Judge WILLIAM H. KIRKPATRICK.*
SMITH, Judge.


1
Syntex Corporation is the common assignee of the appealed application1 and the 2 patents2 relied upon for the rejection. Different joint inventors are named in the application and in the patents. Albert Bowers, one of the nominal appellants here, is one of the joint inventors in the appealed application and in the 2 above named patents. The appealed application is senior in filing date to the applications upon which the patents were issued.


2
The Board of Appeals in its decision of March 18, 1964 affirmed3 the rejection of appealed claims 1 to 12 of appellants' application as "unpatentable over" claim 1 of the Bowers and Edwards patent and affirmed the rejection of appealed claim 13 as being "unpatentable over" claim 16 of the Bowers and Berkoz patent.


3
Closely related subject matter is disclosed in the patents and the application on appeal. The steroid compounds here claimed differ from the compounds claimed in the indicated patents by the presence in the steroid structure of a 2-methyl group instead of a hydrogen atom.


4
It was the examiner's position that the 2-methyl compounds of the appealed claims are so closely related to the hydrogen containing, or 2-desmethyl, compounds of the indicated patent claims as to be, in the words of the Board of Appeals, "obvious therefrom to those skilled in the art."


5
The statutory basis for the rejection is not clear from the record. While using certain of the language of 35 U.S.C. § 103, in affirming the examiner's rejection,4 the board does not explain how the patents, issuing on applications filed later than the filing date of the appealed application, can be considered as prior art against the invention here claimed. Earlier filed applications of "another" describing the invention claimed in a later filed application are prior art under 35 U.S.C. § 102(e) and as such are available for consideration in a 35 U.S.C. § 103 "obviousness" rejection Hazeltine Research, Inc. v. Brenner, 382 U.S. 252, 86 S.Ct. 335, 15 L.Ed.2d 304. However, the rule does not warrant a rejection under 35 U.S.C. §§ 102 or 103 on patents that issued on later filed applications. Such references are clearly excluded by the precise language of sections 102(e) and 103.

The opinion of the board seeks to justify the rejection in its statement:

* * * The Examiner rules that, in view of this close relationship and the obviousness of the claimed compounds from the patented claims, appellants are not entitled to receive a patent on the basis of the appealed claims, since appellants' assignee had received patent protection on essentially the same inventions in the Bowers and Edwards and the Bowers and Berkoz patents. * * *

* * * * * *

8
It is unfortunate that the issue of "double patenting" was not raised at the earliest possible date * * *.


9
There is no objection of record concerning this being a new ground of rejection.


10
Subsequent to the decision of the board, a petition for rehearing was filed in which the separate nature of the involved inventions was pointed out and discussed. Later, and subsequent to our decision of May 14, 1964 in In re Robeson, 331 F.2d 610, 51 CCPA 1271, appellants filed a letter of June 19, 1964, in which the Board of Appeals was requested to consider the disclaimer, filed concurrently therewith, in which they disclaimed:


11
* * * the terminal portion of the term of the above identified application Serial No. 138,265 as would extend beyond October 2, 1979, the expiration date of U. S. Patent No. 3,056,814, with respect to Claims 1-12, and as would extend beyond March 19, 1980, the expiration date of U. S. Patent No. 3,082,220, with respect to Claim 13.


12
Appellants' letter of June 19, 1964 refers to our Robeson decision as being "directly in point" and argued:


13
* * * that the attached disclaimer obviates the basis of the double patenting rejection of claims 1-13 on appeal, over the common assignee's Patent No. 3,056,814 and No. 3,082,220. The disclaimer precludes any extension of the monopoly since it provides for the expiration of the above identified application, if patented, simultaneously with Patent Nos. 3,056,814 and 3,082,220.


14
In its decision on the petition for reconsideration, the board considered the contents of the letter of June 19, 1964, and criticized one of the signatures appearing on the disclaimer. It then stated:


15
Assuming that this paper were a disclaimer operative to disclaim the indicated portions of a patent granted on the instant applications, we could give it no weight in the present appeal because it is not apparent that In re Robeson, supra, or the subsequent decision, In re Kaye, 51 CCPA [1465, 332 F.2d 816] 141 USPQ 829, apply to the situation where a terminal disclaimer is offered with respect to the commonly owned patent of a different inventive entity. * * *


16
Subsequently appellants filed a new disclaimer to overcome the board's criticism as to form which was accepted and has been duly recorded in the United States Patent Office. By order of the court upon granting appellants motion to correct diminution of record, which was not objected to by the Solicitor for the U. S. Patent Office, this new disclaimer was added to the record. The Solicitor here does not challenge the sufficiency of the new disclaimer nor does he argue that the effect of the terminal disclaimer on the rejection is not before us. We will therefore turn to a consideration of the subject matter defined in the appealed claims and the patent claims.


17
We find that we are here dealing with different inventions. As pointed out in appellants' brief:


18
It is apparent that a single invention is not involved. The inventions of the involved application and those of the reference patents are not identical; they are different and distinct inasmuch as the inventions differ in the presence of a CH2 grouping at a specific position in the complex steroid molecule. It is clear that the claims of the Bowers and Orr application, which was the first filed application, define an invention separate and different from those defined in the reference patents owned by the same assignee.


19
Appellants also point out in their brief that "Each invention would be patentable absent the other," which is not disputed by the Patent Office. The brief then continues:


20
It is clear that separate, distinct and nonidentical inventions are described in the application at bar and in the patented inventions. It is therefore contended that a terminal disclaimer is appropriate in the case at bar to overcome a double patenting rejection under the holding of In re Robeson and In re Kaye.


21
As we stated in Kaye, supra, 332 F.2d at 819, 51 CCPA at 1468, in reference to Robeson, supra:


22
In that case we held that where, as here, the claims define separate, albeit patentably indistinct, inventions, the filing of a terminal disclaimer may obviate a double patenting rejection.


23
Thus, it seems to us that the board's position must stand or fall on the issue of whether our decisions in Robeson, supra, and Kaye, supra, as stated by the board, "apply to the situation where a terminal disclaimer is offered with respect to the commonly owned patent of a different inventive entity."


24
It is true that in both Robeson, supra, and Kaye, supra, the double patenting rejections which we found to be obviated by the terminal disclaimer were predicated in each case on the same inventorship. However, we find this to be a distinction without legal significance in the present context.


25
Statutory authority for the terminal disclaimer here in issue is found in 35 U.S.C. § 253, the second paragraph of which provides:


26
In like manner any patentee or applicant may disclaim or dedicate to the public the entire term, or any terminal part of the term, of the patent granted or to be granted.


27
It is to be noted that the parties authorized by the statute to file the terminal disclaimer are "any patentee or applicant." It seems clear that Congress intended that the remedies of this section were also to be available to assignees in view of the express provision of 35 U.S.C. § 100(d) that:


28
(d) The word "patentee" includes not only the patentee to whom the patent was issued but also the successors in title to the patentee.


29
The statutory provisions thus support appellants' position and are contrary to the solicitor's arguments.


30
The solicitor argues that the common assignee here, in effect, seeks to circumvent sections 102(e) and 103 by filing a terminal disclaimer. This argument lacks substance as here there can be no resort to those sections. Where the inventorship is different and there is a common assignee, as here, the first filed application which issues as a patent is "by another" and if the invention claimed in the second application is "described" in the first application, it is available under section 102(e) as prior art which is relevant for consideration under section 103. If the second filed application issues first, there can be no resort to section 102(e) to establish it as prior art under section 103 as against the first filed application. This results from the controlling effect which is given under the statute to the United States filing dates. Sections 102 (e) and 103 provide grounds of rejection which are distinct and separate from "double patenting," requiring different inquiries and representing mutually exclusive grounds for rejecting claims. Where there are separate inventions and the ground of rejection is double patenting, based on the alleged unlawful timewise extension of monopoly, the rejection may be overcome by a terminal disclaimer.


31
We are of the opinion, therefore, that the common assignee of the appealed application and the involved patents is entitled to proceed under 35 U.S.C. § 253.


32
The solicitor relies on two decisions in other courts, Sterling Varnish Co. v. Louis Allis Co., 145 F.Supp. 810 (E.D.Wis. 1956), aff'd on rehearing, 149 F.Supp. 826 (1957); and Hays v. Reynolds, 242 F.Supp. 206 (D.C.1965), aff'd, Hays v. Brenner, 357 F.2d 287 (D.C. Cir. 1966). The solicitor has extracted from these two cases the rule that a common assignee may not file a terminal disclaimer to obviate a double patenting rejection. Upon analysis of the cases we find they do not support such a rule.


33
In the Sterling case the court sustained a defense of double patenting in a suit for patent infringement (145 F.Supp. 810). The two patents issued to the same inventor (a fact apparently overlooked by the solicitor) and were assigned to the plaintiff. Both patents related to coating an electrical winding with varnish, the later issued patent being a continuation-in-part of the first. The first patent required that the winding be coated by "rotating" in the varnish while the second patent required that the winding be coated by "contacting" or "immersing" the winding in the varnish. Also the first patent called for "heating" the winding to the temperature of the varnish while the second patent required that the winding be "highly heated" or "at a temperature not below 275° F." The court found the invention to be the same in both patents, the alleged differences being no more than the "mere use of obviously alternate, immaterial and equivalent terms." 145 F.Supp. at 815.


34
Plaintiff filed a terminal disclaimer as to the later issued patent after the court's decision and on plaintiff's motion to modify the decision the court found the two patents claimed the "same invention" and held that the terminal disclaimer was "legally insufficient," (149 F.Supp. 829) relying on our decision in In re Siu, 222 F.2d 267, 42 CCPA 864. In Siu we held that when in fact a second application claimed the same subject matter as a previously issued patent, a double patenting rejection was proper and a terminal disclaimer would not overcome such a rejection. The Sterling and Siu decisions are not applicable to the fact situation here in which the appealed application and the issued patents in fact claim different inventions.5 Thus in the instant case, unlike the situation in Sterling and Siu, there are clearly three inventions involved and the respective claims define different subject matter.


35
In Hays a rather complex record clouds the issue ultimately decided by the courts. Hays' claims were rejected in view of a patent to Keating. The Hays application and the Keating patent were commonly assigned. The application on which the Keating patent issued, although having a later filing date than the Hays application, was, however, a continuation-in-part of three applications filed prior to Hays. The examiner's answer before the board stated two grounds of rejection of the appealed Hays' claims: first, as "unpatentable over the claims of the Keating patent;" and second, as "lacking invention over the Keating parent case No. 598,215, as noted in the Keating patent." The examiner argued that the filing date of the Keating parent case had not been overcome.


36
The board in its decision affirming the examiner refers to the first ground of rejection as "double patenting." Concerning the second basis for the rejection, the board stated:


37
Appellant has filed no reply to this rejection and inasmuch as we find no obvious error therein it is sustained.6


38
In a civil action under 35 U.S.C. § 145 in the District Court, District of Columbia, the position of the Patent Office was that the Hays claims stood rejected on two grounds: (1) double patenting based on the claims of the Keating patent; and (2) that the subject matter claimed by Hays was obvious in view of a prior disclosure by Keating. The filing date of the parent application of Keating and the subject matter carried over into the Keating patent was relied on by the Patent Office. The solicitor disclaimed any reliance on the Keating abandoned application alone. The solicitor explained that this had been the position of both the examiner and the board.


39
The District Court in its decision utilized both "double patenting" and section 103 language in finding for the Commissioner. The findings of fact make it clear that the court found the subject matter claimed by Hays would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of the work done previously by Keating. The record shows that the District Court relied on the earlier filing date of Keating. In double patenting situations, of course, the filing date is of no concern, which suggests to us that the real basis for the decision of the court was 35 U.S.C. § 103.


40
The briefs filed in the Court of Appeals, District of Columbia, in the Hays case and that court's opinion leave no doubt that the statutory basis for refusing a patent to Hays was 35 U.S.C. § 103, and this notwithstanding some of the District Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law.


41
The solicitor stated in his brief before the Court of Appeals in the Hays case:


42
* * * Hence, it is clear from the record that Keating's parent application, which was filed on July 16, 1956 antedates the application at bar. Section 120 of Title 35 USC makes that date the effective date of all subject matter disclosed in Keating's patent which is also disclosed in the parent abandoned application.


43
* * * * * *


44
* * * Hays' purported invention is a narrow improvement over the Keating invention * * * [and] that improvement must be evaluated in accordance with statutory standards (35 U.S.C. § 103) to determine whether appellants are entitled to a patent based on the claims at issue.


45
In view of the fact that Keating's work, as disclosed in the abandoned application and carried forward into the issued patent, was subject matter "described in a patent granted on an application for patent by another [Keating] filed in the United States before the invention thereof by the applicant [Hays]" it was prior art under 35 U.S.C. § 102(e) and 103; Hazeltine Research, Inc. v. Brenner, supra. Despite this fact, both parties injected some double patenting language into the issue before the Court of Appeals.7


46
The Court of Appeals in its opinion refused to consider the merits of any alleged double patenting rejection:


47
Appellants' principal effort before us is limited to showing that, while the Hays "invention" may be obvious under 35 U.S.C. § 103, "in any event the claims of Hays define a different and significantly different invention from the invention pointed out by the claims of Keating and thus the double patenting rejection is obviated by the terminal disclaimer." (Emphasis in appellants' brief.) In answering this contention, we find it unnecessary to undertake an analysis of the differences between the Keating patent and the Hays application, or to determine whether the Hays "invention" is different from the Keating invention. Since appellants' contention for patentability based on the filing of the terminal disclaimer assumes obviousness, § 103 is an absolute bar to the grant of a patent. (357 F.2d at 289)


48
We agree with the Court of Appeals in Hays that a terminal disclaimer will not obviate a rejection for obviousness in view of the prior art under 35 U.S.C. § 103. That situation is not presented here and the solicitor's reliance on the Hays decision is misplaced. The facts here, however, present a case in which the filing of a terminal disclaimer, as permitted under section 253, is effective to overcome a rejection based only on double patenting. The different chemical compounds defined in the respective claims are different inventions. The claims specify these differences and thus do not define the same invention. In re Siu, supra.


49
In summary, where there are in fact separate inventions, each of which is considered patentable over the prior art absent a patent on the other, a rejection based upon double patenting can be obviated by the filing of a terminal disclaimer under 35 U.S.C. § 253 which may be filed by a common assignee.


50
In view of the foregoing, the decision of the board is reversed.


51
Reversed.

 An additional reference cited by the examiner "to show the state of the art" was not made a part of the record before this court. We therefore do not consider its teachings in this appeal


4
 It is clear from the following statement in the examiner's answer that the rejection was based on obviousness under 35 U.S.C. § 103:
Claims 1-12 are rejected as being unpatentable over claim 1 of copending application Serial No. 149,502, of common assignee, now U. S. Patent No. 3,056,814. It is the Examiner's position that the claimed 2-methyl compounds are so closely allied to the 2-desmethyl compounds set forth in the reference, as to be obvious to those skilled in the art and therefore unpatentable under the terms of 35 U.S.C. 103. * * *
* * * * *
Claim 13 has also been rejected as being unpatentable over claim 16 of copending application Serial No. 175,680, of common assignee, now U. S. Patent No. 3,082,220, for the same reasons as set forth in the prece[e] ding paragraph.
* * * * *
* * * In view of the cited references, the instant claimed 2-methylated compounds are deemed obvious to those skilled in the art and therefore unpatentable under the terms of 35 U.S.C. 103. * * *
No such rejection is warranted under section 103. In view of the later filing date of the reference patents they cannot properly be considered as prior art for purposes of a section 103 rejection.


5
 InSterling, sections 102(e) and 103 were inapplicable during prosecution because of the same inventorship and copendency. In Siu, involving different inventorship and a common assignee, the patent issued on the earlier filed application. The Patent Office pursued the narrower ground of rejection, double patenting, because the patent claimed the same subject matter as in the second application.


6
 On petition for rehearing the board adhered to its original decision stating a reply to the second rejection during oral argument was no substitute for written argument. On petition to the Commissioner, reopening of prosecution of the case was denied because an action had been commenced in the District Court. In view of the arguments made in the District Court and Court of Appeals, the solicitor apparently preferred to pursue a rejection under section 103, discussed infra in the text, and did not rely on the alleged failure of Hays to reply to the rejection


7
 Appellant apparently tried to avoid the section 103 obviousness rejection by calling it "double patenting" so as to argue that a terminal disclaimer obviated the rejection. The solicitor apparently wished to characterize the issues in In re Robeson and in In re Kaye, supra, as involving section 103, which they did not
While in those cases we held that an "obvious" type double patenting rejection could be overcome by filing a terminal disclaimer, that does not mean that a section 103 rejection for obviousness may be similarly overcome. Under section 103, a reference patent is available for all it fairly discloses to one of ordinary skill in the art. There is no inquiry as to what is claimed therein. In the "obviousness" type of double patenting rejections, the test is not what would be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art from reading the specification on the claims. In re Sarett, 327 F.2d 1005, 51 CCPA 1180. Rather, the inquiry is much more limited in nature and the patent is considered only to compare the invention defined in the patent claims with the invention defined in the application claims.

The opinion in this case is a logical extension of the reasoning of the Court in In re Robeson, 331 F.2d 610, 51 CCPA 1271, and In re Kaye, 332 F.2d 816, 51 CCPA 1465. The rationale of those decisions requires the reversal of the board's decision in the present case and, for that reason only, I concur.

AMERICAN CONTINENTAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, an Arizona Corporation, Appellant and Cross-Appellee,
v.
RANIER CONSTRUCTION CO., INC., Appellee and Cross-Appellant.
No. 13950.

February 6, 1980.
Rehearing Denied March 11, 1980.

GORDON, Justice:
This appeal involves a suit for breach of a construction contract between American Continental Life Insurance Co. (American) and Ranier Construction Co., Inc. (Ranier). After trial by jury, a verdict was returned for Ranier in the amount of $130,000 and for American in the amount of $10,000 on its counterclaim. The trial judge determined that neither party was entitled to recover attorney's fees from the other. Both parties appeal. Having jurisdiction pursuant to 17A A.R.S., Rules of Civil Appellate Procedure, Rule 19(e), we reverse the judgment in favor of Ranier and the court's disposition of attorney's fees.
American contracted with Ranier to construct a building for $517,286.30. To date, American has paid Ranier $457,247.47. The contract required American to make monthly progress payments for 90% of the work completed each month upon the issuance by the architect of a certificate for payment. American refused to make the final payment, consisting of the 10% retained each month and the amount due for work completed after the date of the last progress payment. It claimed that Ranier had breached the procedural requirements of the contract and had failed to construct the building in a workmanlike manner and in accordance with the plans and specifications. Ranier subsequently instituted suit for breach of the contract, to recover funds retained under the contract and damages for delays and lost profits. American counterclaimed for breach of contract and negligence, to recover damages for faulty construction and delays. The jury returned a single verdict for Ranier in the amount of $130,000 and a single verdict for American in the amount of $10,000. American appeals the verdict in favor of Ranier. Ranier cross appeals the trial court's refusal to award attorney's fees to Ranier as the prevailing party.[1]
At the close of Ranier's case and again at the close of all the evidence, American moved for a directed verdict, which was denied. One of the grounds urged by American was that Ranier had failed to meet a condition precedent to the right to final payment, because it had failed to procure from the architect a final certificate for payment as provided in the contract. *55 American renews this argument on appeal, contending that the court erred in denying its motion for a directed verdict.
Article 7 of the contract provides:
"Final payment constituting the entire unpaid balance of the Contract Sum shall be paid by the Owner to the Contractor within thirty (30) days after Substantial Completion of the Work * * * provided the work has then been completed * * * and a final Certificate for Payment has been issued by the Architect."
Issuance of the final certificate for payment is governed by paragraph 9.7.2 of the General Conditions of the contract:
"Upon receipt of written notice that the Work is ready for final inspection and acceptance and upon receipt of a final Application for Payment, the Architect will promptly make such inspection and, when he finds the Work acceptable under the Contract Documents and the Contract fully performed, he will promptly issue a final Certificate for Payment stating that to the best of his knowledge, information and belief, and on the basis of his observations and inspections, the Work has been completed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Contract Documents and that the entire balance found to be due the Contractor, and noted in said final Certificate, is due and payable."
The architect issued a certificate of substantial completion,[2] but Ranier admits that a final certificate for payment, as provided for in the contract, was never applied for or obtained. American asserts, and it is undisputed by Ranier, that it was Ranier's responsibility to procure issuance of the certificate. Ranier argues, however, that strict compliance with the requirement of a final certificate for payment was waived, because, from the beginning, both parties deviated from the formal requirements of the contract in other respects. Ranier cites as examples the fact that change orders, although done at the owner's request, were not signed by the owner; that on occasion the owner even ordered changes to be made without execution of a formal change order; that extensions of time were granted both formally and informally; and that the owner, although in agreement, also failed to sign extensions of time. The trial court believed that there was sufficient evidence to support a submission to the jury as to whether strict compliance had been waived. We disagree.
Waiver is either the express, voluntary, intentional relinquishment of a known right or such conduct as warrants an inference of such an intentional relinquishment. See, e.g., City of Tucson v. Koerber, 82 Ariz. 347, 313 P.2d 411 (1957). Waiver by conduct must be established by evidence of acts inconsistent with an intent to assert the right. Occidental Life Insurance Co. v. Jacobson, 15 Ariz. 242, 137 P. 869 (1914); see Bolo Corp. v. Homes and Son Construction Co., Inc., 105 Ariz. 343, 464 P.2d 788 (1970). The waiver of one right under a contract does not necessarily waive other rights under the contract. See O'Malley v. Cummings, 86 Ill. App.2d 446, 229 N.E.2d 878 (1967). Thus, even if American did waive other rights under the contract relating to change orders or extensions of time, that conduct does not manifest an intent to waive any right relating to payment for *56 work. See Practical Construction Co. v. Granite City Housing Authority, 416 F.2d 540 (7th Cir.1969). Ranier does not indicate any evidence, nor does any evidence appear in the record, that the parties ever disregarded any of the terms of the contract relating to payments. Accordingly, we find no waiver.[3]
Ranier also argues, alternatively, that certain acts by American[4] prevented fulfillment of the condition precedent, thereby excusing performance. We fail to perceive how these acts prevented Ranier from seeking a final certificate of payment from the architect. Similarly, we reject Ranier's assertion that seeking a final certificate of payment would have been a futile act, because American had already demonstrated its unwillingness to co-operate by refusing to sign the certificate of substantial completion. The failure of American to sign the certificate of substantial completion has nothing to do with Ranier's obligation under the contract to procure the final certificate of payment in order to be in a posture to claim that payment from American is due. Moreover, even if Ranier is correct in assuming that American would not have made the final payment had Ranier sought and received the final certificate of payment from the architect, Ranier is not excused from the contractually-imposed duty of acquiring the certificate. Without it, we have no way of knowing if the architect was satisfied that the list of items to be completed between the time of issuance of the certificate of substantial compliance and the application for final payment[5] had been completed and that the contract was, thus, fully performed. At the trial, in fact, the architect testified that after he issued the certificate of substantial completion, the building was not complete, and items on the "punch" list remained unfinished.[6]
We agree with American that the final certificate for payment is not "procedural chaff." It is a major substantive right, which "serves a vital interest, in that it induces the contractor to render a performance that conforms in fact to plans and specifications, spurs him to stay with the job and, upon completion, furnishes the main incentive to make conforming corrections." Loyal Erectors, Inc. v. Hamilton & Son, Inc., 312 A.2d 748, 755 (Me. 1973). The trial court erred in failing to direct a verdict in American's favor because of Ranier's *57 non-compliance with the condition precedent of obtaining a final certificate of payment.
American challenges the jury's award to Ranier on several other grounds, which we need not consider, because we reverse on the basis of the court's denial of American's motion for a directed verdict. We next address the issue of attorney's fees raised by Ranier.
The contract between American and Ranier provides for attorney's fees in the following language:
"In the event of litigation between the parties hereto arising out of this Contract or the performance of the Work hereunder, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees in addition to any other damages allowed by law." Supplementary General Conditions, Paragraph 15.3.
The trial judge would not allow either party to recover attorney's fees from the other, because he believed that both parties had breached their agreements, and he considered this finding implicit in the jury's verdicts. Because of our decision today reversing the judgment in favor of Ranier, American is clearly the prevailing party and is entitled to recover attorney's fees by the above express provision of the contract.
The judgment in favor of Ranier is reversed and remanded to the trial court with directions to enter judgment in American's favor upon Ranier's complaint and to award attorney's fees to American.
HOLOHAN, V.C.J., and HAYS and CAMERON, JJ., concurring. STRUCKMEYER, Chief Justice, dissenting.
I cannot agree with the disposition of this case by the majority of this Court. In order that the case be placed in perspective, certain facts should be emphasized.
Eight years ago, Ranier Construction Company entered into a contract by which it agreed to construct an office building for American Continental for $517,286.30. Approximately three years later, Ranier brought this suit for damages for partial nonpayment of the cost of constructing the building. American Continental asserted that Ranier had not constructed the building in conformity with standards of good workmanship and that no final certificate for payment had been issued by the architect as required by the contract. American Continental counterclaimed against Ranier for an amount necessary to put the building in compliance with the construction agreement. After a trial and a view of the building by the jury, a verdict of $130,000 was returned in favor of Ranier, and $10,000 in favor of American Continental on its counterclaim.
American Continental employed the architectural firm of Haver, Nunn & Nelson, Inc., by separate written agreement, to prepare the plans for the building and to supervise its construction. By the specific language of paragraph 2.2.2 of the construction contract, the architect was made the owner's agent.
American Continental early became dissatisfied with the progress of the work, and the delay in completion of the contract became one of its grounds for refusal to pay Ranier the balance due on the contract. By paragraph 8.3.1 of the construction contract, as amended, it is provided:
"If Contractor is delayed at any time in the progress of the Work by an act * * of the Owner or Architect or by any employee of either, or by any separate contractor employed by Owner, or by changes ordered in the Work * * * then the Contract time shall be extended by a Change Order for a reasonable period of time as determined by the Architect to cover such occurrences."
The evidence at the trial established that the architect had extended by change order every delay of which American Continental complained. (By amended subparagraph 2.2.10, either party was authorized to bring an action "concerning the matter decided by the architect.")
The construction contract also provided by paragraph 3.2.4, "The owner shall issue *58 all instructions to the Contractor through the Architect." American Continental early breached this clause of the contract by placing a personal representative on the job site who gave orders directly to sub-contractors as well as the contractor's personnel working on the job.
By the construction agreement, when the work on the building was substantially completed, Ranier was authorized to request the architect to issue a Certificate of Substantial Completion. A Certificate of Substantial Completion is issued by the architect when the building is in such a condition that the owner can occupy it. At that time, the responsibility for insurance and maintenance of the property becomes the owner's. Accompanying the Certificate of Substantial Completion is what is called the "final punch list." This is a list of matters to be corrected or completed before the architect will issue a Certificate of Final Payment. Copies of the Certificate of Substantial Completion and "final punch list" were issued by the architect and delivered to Walter Bush, President of American Continental, for his signature on October 10, 1973. However, Bush refused to accept the architect's "final punch list", submitting a list of things with which he required Ranier to comply before the building would be acceptable to him. Lawrence Blesh, President of Ranier Construction, Inc., later testified at the trial without contradiction:
"Q Did Ranier comply with the punch list that the architect prepared?
A Yes, we did.
Q Did Mr. Bush himself prepare his own punch list?
A Yes, he did.
Q Did you attempt to comply with that?
A We attempted to."
Eventually an impasse developed with the architect supporting Ranier against Bush's demands for further corrections as being unreasonable.
Blesh testified:
"Q Was payment demanded by you from Mr. Bush?
A Yes.
Q Mr. Bush refused to make payment?
A Yes, he did."
Blesh, in bringing suit, obviously treated Bush's conduct, including his refusal to make payment, as an anticipatory breach.
"We have recognized that an action may be maintained for breach of contract based upon the anticipatory repudiation by one of the parties to the contract. Sarle v. School Dist. No. Twenty-Seven of Pima County, 32 Ariz. 96, 255 P. 994. It is well established that in order to constitute an anticipatory breach of contract there must be a positive and unequivocal manifestation on the part of the party allegedly repudiating that he will not render the promised performance when the time fixed for it in the contract arrives. Mobley v. New York Life Ins. Co., 295 U.S. 632, 55 S.Ct. 876, 79 L.Ed. 1621, 99 A.L.R. 1166; Salot v. Wershow, 157 Cal. App.2d 352, 320 P.2d 926; Atkinson v. District Bond Co., 5 Cal. App.2d 738, 43 P.2d 867; Preston v. Love, 240 S.W.2d 486 (Tex.Civ.App. 1951); 4 Corbin on Contracts § 973 (1951); 5 Williston on Contracts § 1324 (rev. ed. 1937); Restatement of the Law of Contracts § 318." Diamos v. Hirsch, 91 Ariz. 304, 372 P.2d 76 (1962).
One further fact should be stressed. In December 1973, prior to the bringing of this action, American Continental took possession of the building and has been occupying and using it for the purpose for which it was built ever since.
It is clear from the most cursory perusal of the facts in this case that when ultimately an impasse developed, Bush treated the construction contract as at an end. It is of no significance or materiality to this lawsuit as to who was at fault in causing the final repudiation[1] because even if we assume *59 that it was Ranier, the law does not foreclose the right to recover for the proper work done under the contract and for materials which were furnished to the building. American Continental acquired a building which the architect said was substantially completed in conformity with the plans and specifications.
"The common-law rule required literal performance of building contracts, but the American courts generally hold that substantial performance of such contracts will support a recovery either on the contract or on a quantum meruit basis. Three reasons are given for that holding. One is that materials and labor upon a building are such that even if rejected by the owner of the land he receives benefit thereof. Since the owner receives the benefits of the builder's labor and materials, it is equitable to require the owner to pay for what he gets. The second reason is that it is next to impossible for a builder to comply literally with all the minute specifications in a building contract. And the third is that the parties are presumed to have impliedly agreed to do what is reasonable under all the circumstances with reference to the subject of performance. 6 R.C.L., page 667, Sec. 343; 9 Am.Jur., page 30, Sec. 40; 17 C.J.S. Contracts § 508, page 1085; Hickory Investment Co. v. Wright Lumber Co., 152 Miss. 825, 119 So. 308." Standard Millwork & Supply Co. v. Mississippi Steel & Iron Co., 205 Miss. 96, 38 So.2d 448 (1949).
The California Court of Appeals, in Martin v. Karsh, 142 Cal. App.2d 468, 298 P.2d 635, 636-637 (1956), put it this way:
"The law is settled in this state, that in the case of building contracts, especially where the owner has taken possession of the building and is enjoying the fruits of the contractor's work, no literal compliance with the contract in all details and no absence of all defects and imperfections is required to entitle the contractor to recovery on the contract, but that he can have such recovery after substantial performance in good faith, if the deviations and imperfections do not substantially affect the usefulness of the building for the purposes for which it was intended, subject to an allowance for damages if the owner has suffered any by reason of the failure to perform strictly."
The Rhode Island court, in Ferris v. Mann, 99 R.I. 630, 210 A.2d 121 (1965), said:
"The common-law rule that there must be complete or absolute performance with the terms of a building contract for plaintiff to recover the agreed consideration has long since been relaxed in this country. It has been repeatedly held in a number of jurisdictions that where the builder has not wilfully deviated from the specifications of a contract and all that remained to be done in order to constitute performance within the meaning of the contract is of a trivial or minor nature, the builder is entitled to recover the contract price with adjustments made by the court to compensate defendant for the unfinished or unsatisfactory work. See Connell v. Higgins, 170 Cal. 541, 150 P. 769, Sgarlat v. Griffith, 349 Pa. 42, 36 A.2d 330, and Pelletier v. Masse, 49 R.I. 408, 143 A. 609." 210 A.2d at 124.
The Missouri Court of Appeals, in Talbot-Quevereaux Const. Co. v. Tandy, 260 S.W.2d 314, 316 (1953), said:
"In the case of substantial but defective performance, where the contractor sues for the contract price and the owner defends by way of recoupment, the owner, upon proof of defective performance, is entitled to have the contractor's recovery reduced by the amount that would reasonably be required to remedy the defects and make the structure conform to the plans and specifications. Spink v. Mueller, 77 Mo. App. 85; Walter v. Huggins, 164 Mo. App. 69, 148 S.W. 148."
And see Jim Arnott, Inc. v. L & E, Inc., 539 P.2d 1333, 1336 (Colo. App. 1975), wherein the court said:

*60 "If it appears that a contractor has substantially performed his contract, then he is entitled to the contract price, less an offset for the cost to remedy the deficiencies. The purpose of the doctrine of substantial performance is to avoid injustice where a building contractor has performed all major aspects of the construction and the owner seeks to avoid payment for inconsequential defects in the work."
The foregoing statements beyond question reflect the status of the law in Arizona. In Cracchiolo v. Carlucci, 62 Ariz. 284, 157 P.2d 352 (1945), a building contract was entered into for the construction of a tourist court or motel near Tucson. The owner took possession of the motel and opened it for business. He refused to pay some $14,000 on the contract and for extras, claiming non-performance of the contract in accordance with the plans and specifications. It was established that the contractor failed to regrade and repave the motel driveway. This Court said:
"Where a contract has been partly performed by one party and the other has derived a substantial benefit therefrom, the latter cannot refuse to comply with its terms simply because the former fails to complete performance. Where there has been part performance and there is a breach of a promise which goes only to a part of the consideration and the breach may be compensated for in damages, the breach does not relieve the other party from his obligation to perform his promise. * * * We believe [these principles] to be applicable to the facts here." 62 Ariz. at 292, 157 P.2d at 355.
When Ranier finally left the job, the construction contract was ended, irrespective of who was responsible for causing its ultimate repudiation. The enforcement by this Court of a condition in the contract which had obviously been renounced, forecloses any recovery by the contractor for his labor and materials put into the building, even though the architect had issued a Certificate of Substantial Completion, and American Continental had occupied the building, thereby unjustly enriching the owner.[2]
The jury, after a twelve-day trial devoted to evidence concerning Ranier's work and after a view of the building, brought in a verdict for Ranier for $130,000 and offset that verdict with a verdict for American Continental on its counterclaim for $10,000. The ultimate absurdity resulting from the Court's opinion is that the owner of the building gets $10,000 for either deficiencies or delays in construction from the contractor, but the contractor is never paid for his work and materials. The order of this Court reversing the judgment of the trial court with directions to enter judgment in American Continental's favor upon Ranier's complaint and, in addition, awarding attorney's fees to American Continental is a gross miscarriage of justice.
I dissent.
NOTES
[1]  We note that Ranier is not appealing the jury's $10,000 verdict in favor of American, and we, therefore, do not consider that facet of the judgment.
[2]  Issuance of the certificate of substantial completion is provided for in Paragraph 9.7.1 of the General Conditions of the contract:

"9.7.1. When the Contractor determines that the Work or a designated portion thereof acceptable to the Owner is substantially complete, the Contractor shall prepare for submission to the Architect a list of items to be completed or corrected. The failure to include any items on such list does not alter the responsibility of the Contractor to complete all Work in accordance with the Contract Documents. When the Architect on the basis of an inspection determines that the Work is substantially complete, he will then prepare a Certificate of Substantial Completion which shall establish the Date of Substantial Completion, shall state the responsibilities of the Owner and the Contractor for maintenance, heat, utilities, and insurance, and shall fix the time within which the Contractor shall complete the items listed therein. The Certificate of Substantial Completion shall be submitted to the Owner and the Contractor for their written acceptance of the responsibilities assigned to them in such Certificate."
[3]  Because we find no waiver, we need not address American's contentions that waiver must be specially pleaded and that Ranier failed to plead it.
[4]  The president of American at one point, in a fit of anger, broke a panel of drywall with an ax to protest what he considered shoddy workmanship. He also hired a special supervisor who Ranier claims improperly began giving orders directly to the workmen.
[5]  The list of items to be completed is provided for in Paragraph 9.7.1 of the General Conditions of the contract. See footnote 2 infra.
[6]  The dissenting opinion discusses another argument to support Ranier's contention that failure to fulfill the condition precedent should not preclude it from bringing suit for the contract price. This is the theory that the contract had been repudiated, thereby obviating the necessity to comply with the condition precedent. We are convinced that the facts of the case do not support repudiation. American's refusal to make the final payment may not be equated with a denial on its part of its obligation to pay under any circumstances, no matter what Ranier did, thereby bringing the contract to an end. While refusing to pay, American continued to demand that Ranier complete the punch list, a clear indication that American considered the contract extant. As stated in its answer, American refused to make final payment because it believed that Ranier had not completed construction according to the contract plans and specifications. Thus, American thought that its duty to make final payment had not yet arisen according to the terms of the contract, not that its contractual obligation was forever terminated.

Additionally, the dissent relies on the doctrine of substantial performance, apparently satisfied that Ranier's deviations were so trivial as to give rise to the doctrine, despite contradictory evidence. By express provision of the contract, the parties set up a system of progress payments whereby the agreed upon value of full compliance by Ranier with the plans and specifications called for within the contract, and as vouched for by the architect, was the final payment by American. To allow the doctrine of substantial performance to operate here would fly in the face of the original intent of the parties and would nullify the contract.
[1]  The court instructed the jury:

"First, in regard to Ranier's complaint if you find that American Continental did not breach the contract, your verdict must be for American Continental. If, however, you find that American Continental breached the contract, your verdict must be for Ranier, * *."
Manifestly, the jury must have found that American Continental breached the contract.
[2]  The court instructed the jury:

"As one of its defenses to Ranier's claims that American Continental has breached the contract by failing to pay the entire amount agreed upon for construction, American Continental has alleged that Ranier has failed or omitted to establish that it has performed certain conditions precedent. * * * a condition precedent is a fact which must exist or occur before a duty to perform a contractual obligation arises.
In this case, if the contract includes conditions precedent those conditions must have been satisfied before Ranier is entitled to release of the retention and final payment, unless you find that American Continental has by its conduct waived its right to rely on performance of those conditions precedent. To constitute waiver there must be voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a known right. It may be expressly stated or inferred by conduct."
The jury could have concluded that when American Continental advised Ranier that it would not pay the balance of the contract, such conduct terminated the contract, thus waiving the condition that payment was dependent on the architect's issuance of a Certificate of Final Payment. But irrespective, if American Continental's conduct is not within the outer limits of waiver, it clearly falls within the doctrine of estoppel in pais, a doctrine courts invoke to promote the ends of justice and to prevent injury and inequitable consequences.

ROBERT G. DOWD, JR., Judge.
State Bank of Jefferson County (State Bank) appeals from the judgment awarding Conrad Stromberg (Stromberg) $80,000 in damages for negligence and conversion in connection with an $80,000 draft (Draft) issued by American Family Mutual Insurance Company (American Family) in connection with a fire insurance claim. On appeal, State Bank argues the trial court *28 erred in granting judgment in favor of Stromberg because (1) under the election of remedies doctrine, Stromberg is precluded from claiming an interest in the Draft, (2) under Section 400.3-420, RSMo 2000,[1] liability for conversion is limited to the plaintiff's interest in the instrument, and (3) the doctrine of unavoidable consequences and the doctrine of laches prevent Stromberg from making a claim against State Bank. On cross-appeal, Stromberg argues the trial court erred in denying him damages by way of interest in its application of Section 408.040. We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.
Viewed in the light most favorable to the judgment, the following facts were adduced at trial. Stromberg owned a plot of ground with buildings located in DeSoto, Missouri. In 1997, Stromberg sold this property to Kevin and Lucinda Moore (collectively referred to as the Moores) for a purchase price of $100,000, receiving $7,000 at closing and taking back a note and Deed of Trust for $93,000. Named as beneficiaries on the Deed of Trust were Stromberg, Mary Stromberg, his wife, Shawn Stromberg, his son, and Margaret Stromberg, his daughter (collectively referred to as the Strombergs). The note secured by the Deed of Trust was payable over twenty years with monthly payments of $807.08. Also at the closing, a policy of fire insurance in the amount of $80,000 was issued on the property naming Complete Auto Repair, the Moore's company, as the insured and Stromberg as the mortgagee.[2]
On June 7, 1998, the buildings on the mortgaged property were completely destroyed by fire. On June 8, 1998, American Family received a telephone proof of loss from its insured, the Moores d/b/a Complete Auto Repair. On July 13, 1998, American Family issued the Draft in the amount of $80,000 which was the total amount of coverage under its policy and made the draft payable to Complete Auto Repair and Stromberg. Kevin Moore received the draft by mail. Stromberg and the Moores met in late July or early August to discuss division of the Draft without reaching any agreement as to its division because the amount the Moores owed Stromberg on the Deed of Trust on the date of the fire was approximately $92,000.[3]
On August 11, 1998, Kevin Moore presented the Draft, purportedly endorsed by both payees, for deposit into his business account at State Bank. Stromberg testified he did not endorse the Draft nor did he authorize Kevin Moore or Complete Auto Repair to endorse the Draft for him.
Linda Tucker, teller for State Bank, testified relating to the deposit of the Draft by Kevin Moore. She testified that Kevin Moore came into the bank with the Draft but was not accompanied by Stromberg. Kevin Moore told Linda Tucker that Stromberg was his partner. Linda Tucker testified that she did not know Stromberg and, at the time of deposit, she did not require identification or verification that Stromberg's signature was correct and genuine. She further testified that there was a partnership resolution on file for *29 Complete Auto Repair showing the signature of Kevin Moore but not that of Stromberg. In fact, Stromberg was never a part of the partnership resolution nor was his signature on record anywhere at State Bank.
Richard Francis, president of State Bank, testified that Stromberg was not a customer of the bank and that he would not have received any notice of account activity. Richard Francis also testified that the bank had no relationship with Stromberg nor did he know of or did the bank have a financial interest in the transaction between Stromberg and Kevin Moore. Additionally, Richard Francis testified the teller is required to know the endorser. There was no signature card on file bearing Stromberg's signature.
Handwriting expert, William Storer, testified that it was his opinion the signature of Stromberg was not genuine.
Before discovering the Draft had been deposited, Stromberg foreclosed on the mortgaged property on November 10, 1998. At the time of foreclosure, he was not aware that Kevin Moore had deposited the Draft into State Bank over the forgery of his signature. Stromberg took back the real estate at the foreclosure sale. Stromberg testified he did not know that the Draft was deposited until after the foreclosure. Stromberg was never a customer of State Bank, nor did he have access to any financial information that he could have reviewed to know of the deposit.
After discovering the Draft had been deposited without his consent, Stromberg notified State Bank sometime in November of 1998 of the forgery and later received a phone call from Richard Francis asking why the forgery had not been reported sooner. Stromberg replied that he reported the forgery as soon as he found out about it.[4] Stromberg sent a letter to State Bank after it had been confirmed the Draft was forged. Stromberg demanded return of the Draft proceeds. State Bank, through Richard Francis, denied Stromberg's demand.
This case was presented for trial. After trial, the trial court entered a judgment granting damages for conversion in favor of Stromberg, but denying Stromberg damages by way of interest from the date of conversion. This appeal follows.
On appeal, State Bank argues the trial court erred in granting judgment in favor of Stromberg because under the election of remedies doctrine, Stromberg is precluded from claiming an interest in the Draft. Specifically, State Bank contends that because Stromberg foreclosed on the property as a means of recovering his damages, rather than pursuing a claim against State Bank on the Draft, Stromberg elected his remedy and now cannot pursue a claim for conversion against State Bank. In related points, State Bank argues that liability for conversion is limited to a plaintiff's interest in the instrument, and that the doctrine of unavoidable consequences and the doctrine of laches prevent Stromberg from making a claim against State Bank. We disagree.
In a court-tried case, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed on appeal unless there is no substantial evidence to support it, it is against the weight of the evidence, or it erroneously declares or applies the law. Murphy v. Carron, 536 S.W.2d 30, 32 (Mo. banc 1976). Id. We accept all evidence and inferences favorable to the judgment, and disregard all *30 contrary inferences. P & K Heating and Air Conditioning, Inc. v. Tusten Townhomes Redevelopment Corp., 877 S.W.2d 121, 123 (Mo.App. E.D.1994). We are bound by the trial court's factual findings if supported by substantial evidence in the record. Id.
The election of remedies doctrine, a doctrine of estoppel, originates from the theory that "where a party has the right to pursue one of two inconsistent remedies and he makes his election, institutes suit, and prosecutes it to final judgment, he cannot thereafter pursue another and inconsistent remedy." Whittom v. Alexander-Richardson Partnership, 851 S.W.2d 504, 506 (Mo. banc 1993)(quoting Tooker, et al., v. Missouri Power & Light Co., 336 Mo. 592, 80 S.W.2d 691, 695 (1935)). The purpose of the election of remedies doctrine is to prevent double redress for a single wrong. Twellman v. Lindell Trust Co., 534 S.W.2d 83, 94 (Mo. App.1976). "Where one elects to pursue one or two or more inconsistent remedies, with full knowledge of all facts, and receives full satisfaction therefrom, he can no longer assert his cause of action." Skandia America Reinsurance Corp. v. Financial Guardian Group, 857 S.W.2d 843, 846 (Mo.App. W.D.1993)(quoting U.S. Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Fidelity Nat. Bank & Trust Co., 232 Mo.App. 412, 109 S.W.2d 47 (1937)). To determine whether remedies are inconsistent, we look at whether one theory alleges what the other denies or whether one theory is repugnant to another. Ellsworth Breihan Bldg. Co. v. Teha Inc., 48 S.W.3d 80, 82 (Mo.App. E.D.2001).
Here, based on the record, there is no election of remedies problem. First, Stromberg did not recover full satisfaction for his losses. While Stromberg recovered his property through foreclosure at a value of $80,000, he was still deprived of the insurance proceeds because of State Bank's conversion. Second, rather than suffering a single wrong, Stromberg suffered a double wrong. The Moores defaulted on their mortgage obligations under the Deed of Trust and, in addition, State Bank negligently accepted a forged endorsement. Stromberg's theory for recovery against the Moores is not repugnant to his theory for recovery against State Bank. Therefore, as a matter of law, Stromberg's foreclosure action against the Moores is not inconsistent with his claim for conversion against State Bank. See Twellman, 534 S.W.2d at 94 (holding that remedy of purchaser of treasurer's check against person who forged the endorsement on the check and remedy against the bank which issued the check and paid it over the forged endorsement were not inconsistent); see also Davis v. Hauschild, 243 S.W.2d 956, 960 (Mo. banc 1951)(holding that claim by plaintiff against defendants for deficiency judgment after foreclosure on the Deed of Trust was not barred by the pursuit in an earlier case of a remedy for breach of covenant in the Deed of Trust because remedies were consistent).
Under the facts of this case, Stromberg had no choice of remedies against State Bank. The only remedy Stromberg had against State Bank was for conversion pursuant to Section 400.3-420. At trial, Stromberg testified he had no way of knowing the Draft had been deposited until he was informed of the deposit by American Family and that information was received in November of 1998 after foreclosure. Stromberg had no choice of remedies because he had no knowledge of the fraud until several months after the act took place in August of 1998. Therefore, at the time of the foreclosure, Stromberg did not have "full knowledge of all facts," as the election of remedies doctrine requires. *31 See Skandia America Reinsurance Corp., 857 S.W.2d at 846.
Similarly, State Bank's argument that Stromberg would receive a "double benefit" by receiving the property by foreclosure in addition to $80,000 resulting from the conversion is unpersuasive.[5] As mentioned earlier, Stromberg suffered two separate wrongs and had a separate remedy for each wrong. Stromberg foreclosed on the property as a result of the Moore's default and, in a separate action, Stromberg pursued State Bank for conversion because State Bank allowed Moore to wrongfully receive payment of the Draft.
Section 400.3-420(a) provides in pertinent part as follows:
An instrument is . . . converted if it is taken by transfer, other than a negotiation, from a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or a bank makes or obtains payment with respect to the instrument for a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or receive payment. [Emphasis added.]
Here, State Bank's acceptance of the Draft outside of Stromberg's presence and without requiring verification that Stromberg's signature was genuine violated the provisions of Section 400.3-420(a). Therefore, under Section 400.3-420(b), which states that "the measure of liability is presumed to be the amount payable on the instrument," Stromberg was entitled to receive the face value of the Draft.
Finally, State Bank's argument that Stromberg's claims against State Bank should be precluded under Section 400.3-406, the doctrine of unavoidable consequences and the doctrine of laches, is equally without merit.[6] Because Stromberg was unaware of the forgery until November, he cannot be charged with failing to take reasonable steps to timely notify State Bank of the wrong. The record reveals Stromberg reported the forgery to State Bank within a day of its discovery. The trial court correctly applied the law. Under the facts of this case, we find there was no election of remedies problem, Stromberg was entitled to the face value of *32 the Draft, and the doctrine of laches and the doctrine of unavoidable consequences are inapplicable. Points one, two, and three are denied.
On cross-appeal, Stromberg argues the trial court erred in denying him an award of damages by way of interest in its application of Section 408.040. Stromberg argues that instead of applying Section 408.040, the trial court should have applied Section Sections 408.020 and 537.520 in awarding damages by way of interest. We agree.
In general, "in actions of trover, or actions in the nature of trover, for the conversion of property, interest or the equivalent of interest on the value of the property converted may be recovered." Independence Flying Service, Inc. v. Ailshire, 409 S.W.2d 628, 632 (Mo.1966). Similarly, "in actions for conversion, in order to give the injured party full indemnity, interest is allowed on the value of the property from the date of its conversion." Id. The rate of interest allowable is that prescribed by Section 408.020. Id.; Southern Missouri Bank v. Fogle, 738 S.W.2d 153, 158 (Mo.App.S.D.1987).
Here, Stromberg challenges that part of the trial court's judgment which states as follows:
No prejudgment interest is awarded since the Plaintiffs did not comply with § 408.040 R.S.Mo. and Uniform Commercial Code does not provide for payment of interest. See §§ 400.3-112(4); 400.3-420. Moreover, there is no evidence that State Bank received a benefit from its conduct.
The seminal case relating to conversion damages is Independence Flying Service v. Ailshire, 409 S.W.2d 628 (Mo.1966). The Independence Flying Service case involved an action for conversion of certain buildings. Id. at 629. As in the present case, the matter was tried without a jury on the issue of damages and the trial court denied interest to the plaintiffs. Id. at 631. In Independence Flying Service, the Missouri Supreme Court reversed the trial court's denial of interest by stating that in actions for conversion, in order to give the injured party full indemnity, interest is allowed from the date of conversion under Section 408.020. Id. at 632.
Moreover, Section 537.520 allows for damages "in the nature of interest, over and above the value of goods at the time of conversion or seizure." Therefore, in a case for conversion, the allowance of interest from the date of conversion is part of the damages element of the case. See Commercial Credit Corp. v. Joplin Auto. Auction Co., 430 S.W.2d 440, 445 (Mo.App. 1968) (holding that award under Section 537.520 in "nature of interest in trover for wrongful conversion is a measurement of damages by the ruling rate of interest, not as interest, but by way of compensatory damages").
State Bank's contention that it received no benefit from the deposits is not relevant to the issue of damages. The loss to Stromberg is the gravamen of the offense and as in Independence Flying Service, good faith or lack of malice is not a sufficient reason for denying the claim for interest. Independence Flying Service, Inc., 409 S.W.2d at 631.
Moreover, we find the trial court misapplied Sections 400.3-112 and 400.3-420[7] in the denial of interest. Section 400.3-112(a) states in part that "[u]nless otherwise provided in the instrument, . . . an *33 instrument is not payable with interest." Here, the trial court improperly relied on Section 400.3-112 in ruling as it did, because the Draft in this case did not provide for interest. Moreover, Section 400.3-112 does not provide for the event of a wrongdoing. When the Draft was presented, there was no interest noted, therefore no interest was paid. However, once the Draft was converted, the law of trover and conversion was applicable because of the language contained in Section 400.3-420, which states that the law of conversion applies to instruments. The law of conversion allows interest from the date of conversion in cases, such as here, where a bank's negligence results in a forged endorsement of an instrument. Hoppe v. First Midwest Bank of Poplar Bluff, 899 S.W.2d 879, 884 (Mo.App. S.D.1995). Therefore, Stromberg is entitled to interest as of the date of conversion under Sections 408.020 and 537.520.
The final issue Stromberg challenges is State Bank's assertion that the trial court properly denied "prejudgment interest" because the notice provision of Section 408.040 was not complied with by Stromberg. Section 408.040 states that if a demand for settlement at a stated figure is made, subject to the notice requirements, and it goes unanswered and the judgment award exceeds that amount demanded, the plaintiff is entitled to prejudgment interest. Section 408.040.2. Section 408.040 does not apply in the instant case because interest is a part of the damages in a conversion case. Stromberg did not seek "prejudgment interest" as defined by Section 408.040, but sought damages for his loss under the law of trover and conversion, Section 400.3-420, which includes interest for the loss of draft proceeds.
The trial court erred in applying the provisions of Section 408.040. Interest in the amount of 9 percent, pursuant to Section 408.020, should be added to the judgment relating back to August 11, 1998, the date of forgery and conversion. The trial court's judgment is affirmed with respect to the award of $80,000 and reversed and remanded for the trial court to add interest pursuant to Sections 408.020 and 537.520.

[1]  The U.C.C. has been adopted by the Missouri legislature and is incorporated into the Missouri statutes. See Chapter 400 of the Missouri Statutes. Unless otherwise indicated, all further references are to RSMo 2000.
[2]  Originally the fire policy was issued through Custom Insurance but coverage was later changed to American Family for the same amount and with the same loss payees.

[4]  Stromberg testified that he had called American Family after the foreclosure sale on November 10, 1998 and at that time American Family informed him, for the first time, the Draft had been negotiated.

Schomaker, 900 S.W.2d 249 (Mo.App. E.D. 1995) cited by State Bank are factually distinguishable from the case at bar. As State Bank admits, these cases dealt with a mortgagee's cause of action against the insurance company under the policy following foreclosure and not, as here, against a third-party bank for conversion under the U.C.C. Moreover, in the cases cited by State Bank, when the debt was extinguished following foreclosure, so was the mortgagee's interest. Here, after foreclosure, the amount owed by the Moores was approximately $92,000, $12,000 more than the assessed value of the recovered property. Therefore, Stromberg's debt was not extinguished by the foreclosure.
[6]  Section 400.3-406 states as follows:

(a) A person whose failure to exercise ordinary care substantially contributes to an alteration of an instrument or to the making of a forged signature on an instrument is precluded from asserting the alteration or the forgery against a person who, in good faith, pays the instrument or takes it for value or for collection.
(b) Under subsection (a), if the person asserting the preclusion fails to exercise ordinary care in paying or taking the instrument and that failure substantially contributes to loss, the loss is allocated between the person precluded and the person asserting the preclusion according to the extent to which the failure of each to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss.
(c) Under subsection (a), the burden of proving failure to exercise ordinary care is on the person asserting the preclusion. Under subsection (b), the burden of proving failure to exercise ordinary care is on the person precluded.
[7]  Section 400-3.420(a) states the law applicable to conversion also applies to instruments. Section 400-3.420(b) states the measure of liability is presumed to be the amount payable on the instrument, not to exceed the amount of the plaintiff's interest in the instrument.

1
The government appeals a judgment entered against it on October 23, 1984, by the United States Claims Court following its opinions in Passaro v. United States, 4 Cl.Ct. 395 (1984), and 5 Cl.Ct. 754 (1984).  The judgment awarded the widow of a military retiree an accrued annuity and future benefits under the Armed Forces Survivor Benefit Plan, Pub.L. No. 92-425, 86 Stat. 706-713 (1972).1   The appeal presents narrow but significant issues of Claims Court jurisdiction and statutory interpretation.  We vacate and remand.I


2
The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) was enacted on September 21, 1972, to establish a new system of benefits for the survivors of military retirees, replacing the Retired Serviceman's Family Protection Plan (RSFPP).  The latter, a self-financing program permitting a service member to provide a percentage of his retired pay as an annuity for his survivors, had proved inadequate, being invoked by only 15 percent of the eligible military personnel.


3
The SBP employed a new concept which made automatic the rights of survivors of military members who retired on or after September 21, 1972, unless the member affirmatively chose not to participate in the plan.  If the member elected not to participate in the plan the statute required that his spouse be notified of the decision.  Section 1448(a).  This section also made an election not to participate in the plan irrevocable if not revoked before the date on which the member first became entitled to retired pay.


4
Major Ramon Passaro, appellee's husband, retired from the United States Army on November 1, 1968.  He elected not to participate in the RSFPP, choosing instead to receive full retirement pay.  Those who, like Major Passaro, had retired before the SBP became law were not, however, left out altogether.  While it was provided in section 1455(3)(a) that the SBP applies "to any person who initially becomes entitled to retired or retainer pay on or after the effective date of this Act," it was further provided in section 1455(3)(b) that "[a]ny person who is entitled to retired or retainer pay on the effective date of this Act may elect to participate in the Survivor Benefit Plan ... before the first anniversary of that date."


5
The Department of the Army contacted all service members who had previously retired and explained to them the benefits and procedures provided by the Survivor Benefit Plan.  This was done on several occasions.  A bulletin was first sent out describing the SBP.  The bulletin was followed by a circular and then by a letter which included a form, which when filled out and returned would extend the benefits of the SBP to those who were already retired.  A "final notice" provided a "box" to check on a postal card indicating the retiree's intention.  Major Passaro received these communications and affirmatively elected not to participate in the SBP by checking the box indicating his intention.  He signed and dated the card on September 4, 1973, which was within the then-existing time limit for a binding answer.


6
Four years after Major Passaro's death, his widow inquired about survivor benefits and was told by the Army that her husband had elected to receive his full retirement pay rather than to provide her with a survivor's annuity through reduced retirement pay.  Her successful suit in the Claims Court and this appeal by the government followed.

II

7
The Claims Court agreed with Mrs. Passaro that the requirement that the spouse be notified of a nonelection of SBP benefits applies to service members who retired both before and after the effective date of the 1972 Act.  The court, thus, assuming jurisdiction of a claim for money damages believed to be due, undertook to fashion an equitable remedy for Mrs. Passaro by deeming her late husband to be a member of the SBP.  We think that the court exceeded its jurisdiction and misread the statute.


8
The Claims Court reached its judgment by writing into the Act a notice requirement it does not have.  Congress knew how to say whether a spouse should be notified of a nonelection of survivor benefits by the military member.  Section 1448(a) required notification but section 1455(3)(a) specified that it applied to "any person who initially becomes entitled to retired or retainer pay on or after the effective date of this Act."    In other words, section 1448(a) applies to a service member who is automatically enrolled in the SBP because he retires on or after the effective date of the Act, September 21, 1972.  Section 1448(a) reads in pertinent part:


9
(a) The Plan applies to a person who is married or has a dependent child when he becomes entitled to retired or retainer pay unless he elects not to participate in the Plan before the first day for which he is eligible for that pay.  If a person who is married elects not to participate in the Plan at the maximum level, that person's spouse shall be notified of the decision.


10
Thus, only a service member automatically enrolled by the Act could make an election not to participate before the first day for which he is eligible for retired or retainer pay.  Those entitled to pay before September 21, 1972, were permitted by Congress to elect to participate rather than not to participate.  The notice provision, therefore, does not apply to a service member who is already entitled to retired or retainer pay.  No principle of statutory construction permits such a notice provision to be implied where it was excluded by Congress.


11
Our views coincide with the administrative interpretation made and consistently applied in the 13 years since enactment of the SBA in 1972.  Importantly, it agrees also with the intent of Congress which has amended the SBP five times and has never seen fit to alter the interpretation given administratively to the spousal notice provisions with respect to pre-SBP retirees.2   This is persuasive evidence to support our interpretation of congressional intent in the matter.   NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U.S. 267, 274-75, 94 S.Ct. 1757, 1761-62, 40 L.Ed.2d 134 (1974).


12
The Claims Court has given weight to tangential remarks of two congressmen to support its interpretation of legislative history.  We have carefully examined the entire legislative history including the statements alluded to and reach a contrary conclusion from the court below.  There is no support for concluding that Congress meant to treat alike, for spousal notice purposes, those who retired both before and after enactment of the SBP.  There is no statement in the hearings and congressional reports on this legislation suggesting that the United States would be liable to suit in money damages with respect to a claim by a widow of a pre-SBP retiree whose husband failed to enroll in the plan.  Pertinent language of other committee members and the House and Senate Reports clearly differentiate between the pre-SBP retiree, and the service member yet to retire, on the points about spousal notice and election in and election out of the plan.  Respectfully, the Claims Court has misread the record and the statute itself.  We hold that the administrative interpretation has been both reasonable and correct.  The court should have taken a less expansive view of the claim by inquiring whether the administrative interpretation of the law was reasonable rather than whether it was the interpretation the court would have desired.

III

13
The judgment below was premised on jurisdiction which did not exist.  It was held that the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1491 (1982), provided the necessary jurisdiction here and reliance was placed on the holding in Barber v. United States, 676 F.2d 651, 230 Ct.Cl. 287 (1982).  That case does not help Mrs. Passaro.  In Barber, the claimant was the widow of a service member who, unlike Mrs. Passaro's husband, retired after the enactment of the SBP and, therefore, was automatically enrolled in the plan.  Sergeant Barber elected out of the plan on the eve of his retirement and no notice was given to his spouse as required by the statute.  The Court of Claims held that Mrs. Barber thus had a Tucker Act claim for money due under a substantive right created by the SBA statute, as clarified by legislative history.  Here, however, only an affirmative decision by Major Passaro to participate in the plan would create a vested interest in his widow upon his death.  The factual and legal situations in the two cases are obviously dissimilar.  Absent a presently due money claim, therefore, the Claims Court had no jurisdiction in the present case to fashion what it described as equitable relief.  Equity, to the extent that it can be administered by the Claims Court, exists as an incident of general jurisdiction under the Tucker Act when that Act is invoked, as it has been here.   Pauley Petroleum, Inc. v. United States, 591 F.2d 1308, 1315-17, 219 Ct.Cl. 24 (1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 898, 100 S.Ct. 206, 62 L.Ed.2d 133 (1979).


14
We hold that nothing in the SBP statute expressly, or by implication, mandates that money damages are available as a remedy for the interpretation by the Army or other military departments that the SBP statute does not require notification of the spouses of pre-SBP retirees who failed or refused to participate in the plan.

CONCLUSION

15
The judgment of the Claims Court is vacated and the case is remanded to that court with the instruction that it dismiss this suit for lack of jurisdiction under the Tucker Act.

THE PEOPLE, Plaintiff and Respondents,
v.
JOE KESSLER, Defendant and Appellant.
Crim. No. 8905. 
California Court of Appeals. Second Dist., Div. Four.  
Oct. 14, 1963.
 Zeman & Fischer and B. D. Fischer for Defendant and Appellant.
 Stanley Mosk, Attorney General, William E. James, Assistant Attorney General, and H. Warren Siegel, Deputy Attorney General, for Plaintiff and Respondent.
 BURKE, P. J.
 [1a] After trial by jury, defendant was found guilty of rape as to one victim and not guilty of *188 assault with intent to commit rape as to another person. Thereafter, the court granted defendant a new trial on the rape charge. At the second trial before a jury defendant was again convicted. A motion for new trial was denied and probation granted conditioned on imprisonment for the first six months in the county jail. Defendant appeals from such judgment.
 [2] The evidence for the prosecution was as follows: On April 3, 1962, while her husband was at work, the prosecutrix was washing her baby's diapers on the service porch. She testified someone seized her from behind, held her arms and placed one hand over her mouth. During the struggle she noted it was defendant who had been a family friend. He forced her into the adjoining bedroom and disrobed her. She attempted to get free and to scratch him but could not. He pushed her on the bed and forcibly committed an act of sexual intercourse. A neighbor testified the prosecutrix came to her house, visibly upset and with a bleeding lip, and related the incident. The neighbor suggested calling the police which was done.
 Defendant, who is an instructor in auto mechanics, testified that he had been asked to come to prosecutrix' home to assist in starting her car. He denied having had intercourse, contending that he was invited into the victim's bedroom and that they merely caressed and kissed each other.
 The record discloses substantial evidence to support the verdict of the jury and as to that point our inquiry rests here. (People v. Newland, 15 Cal.2d 678, 681 [104 P.2d 778].)
 Defendant complains of several specifications of misconduct on the part of the prosecutor which he contends constituted prejudicial error. With but one exception, these concerned matters of minor importance which would not warrant a reversal under the application of section 4 1/2 of article VI of the Constitution and do not merit discussion. However, as to one specification, prejudice to defendant undoubtedly resulted and necessitates reversal.
 [1b] During the voir dire examination the prosecutor stated:
 "There is one other possible witness who is not in court. I can only mention his name and ask if any of you are acquainted with him in any way. Are any of you acquainted in any way with a Jack White, of the Probation Department of Los Angeles County? Is the name familiar to any of you? *189"
 "Now, this case involves, as has been discussed, charges of a sexual nature. Do any of you feel that because of that fact you would rather not sit on a jury?"
 The probation officer was not called by the prosecutor during its case in chief, but only belatedly near the end of the trial, on rebuttal. His testimony in no way tended to prove the commission of the crime but related only to the reason defendant had given for his visit to the home of the prosecutrix the day of the offense. As we have said, at his trial, defendant had stated he had been asked to come to the victim's home to see if he could get her car started. The probation officer testified that defendant had told him in July that the reason for such visit was that the prosecutrix and her husband were interested in buying another automobile. Both reasons could have been valid; the one does not preclude the other. Since the prosecutor stated, when objection was made during the examination of the probation officer, that the testimony was not offered for impeachment purposes, there does not appear to have been any proper purpose related to any disputed issue justifying the introduction of such testimony.
 A portion of the direct examination of the probation officer by the prosecutor is as follows:
 "Q. What is your business or occupation, sir?"
 "A. I am a Deputy Probation Officer with the Los Angeles County Probation Department."
 "Q. Mr. White, calling your attention to the date of July 20th of this year, on that date did you have occasion to have a conversation with this defendant here, Mr. Kessler, concerning at least partially the charges that are presently pending here?"
 "A. I had several conversations with Mr. Kessler. I cannot say the particular date unless I would see my report."
 "Mr. Light: I believe you have seen this, counsel."
 "Q. By Mr. Light: I show you--does this appear to be a copy of your report?"
 "A. It is."
 "Q. And does this make reference to a conversation with the defendant on the date of July 20?"
 "A. No. This is the date that this report was due in court. This would mean that I had to talk with this man at least five days prior to that date."
 "Q. Sometime in that period of time then, shortly before July 20th, did you speak with him? *190"
 "A. Yes, I did."
 "Q. And did portions of that conversation concern the charges that are presently pending here?"
 "A. They did."
 "Q. In other words, this alleged rape on a Harriett Cole?"
 "A. That's correct."
 "Q. About how long did you talk with the defendant concerning these charges, that is the one involving Harriett Cole?"
 "A. Well, indirectly I talked with Mr. Kessler approximately five times. To the best of my knowledge I talked with him in person on two occasions; roughly three hours, approximately one hour on the initial interview and in his home approximately two hours."
 "Q. Now, during the course of that conversation, with reference to his own evaluation of himself, did Mr. Kessler make the statement that in his opinion he may need some help, referring to psychiatric help?"
 "Mr. Zeman: Now, at this time I am going to make certain objections, your Honor, and I would like to make them in the absence of the jury."
 Objections and a motion for mistrial were thereupon made and denied by the court. This was error. Not only did the questions infer that defendant had been found guilty of the particular charges but there was a direct implication that defendant had been involved in other charges.
 Defendant's counsel cross-examined the probation officer, no doubt in an attempt to counteract the unfavorable effect of the probation officer's very presence on the stand, but with disastrous results to his cause. Likewise, answers volunteered by the probation officer, which were not responsive to the questions asked, were very prejudicial:
 "Q. By Mr. Zeman: Did you ask the defendant at any time if he was guilty; do you recall?"
 "A. No, I do not recall. This would not be a normal practice. It is not a probation officer's responsibility to determine one's guilt. We assume they are guilty when they come to us. I may have discussed the essence of this, but I would not say 'Are you guilty?'"
 "Q. You assume it?"
 "A. This is my responsibility to assume it unless it is a pretrial report that I am doing. Then the man has not been found guilty."
 "Q. As far as your office is concerned, at this time he *191 stands innocent of any conviction; at this time as far as your office is concerned?"
 "A. I am not at liberty to speak for the office of the Probation Department. For the report I submitted to the court, the man was guilty, and I had a job to do, and that was to submit a report for the court. I don't know the status of this defendant at this time. On July 20, 1962 when I submitted that report he was."
 "Mr. Zeman: I think at this time I should renew my motions that I previously made at the bench."
 "The Court: You are the one that is asking the questions."
 "Mr. Zeman: I didn't ask him that question."
 "The Court: You sure did."
 "Mr. Zeman: I asked him as far as the status of the probation at this particular time."
 "The Court: Motion denied."
 Defendant contends that such conduct of the prosecution was prejudicial in that it constituted a calculated method of unfairly alluding to a former trial in which the defendant was involved and in which the jury could infer defendant was found guilty.
 In People v. Solis, 193 Cal.App.2d 68, 77 [13 Cal.Rptr. 813], the court stated: "While the use of the probation officer as a witness under the circumstances was extraordinary and involved a practice not to be encouraged, it cannot be said that it constituted prejudicial error." In the Solis case an effect of the testimony of a probation officer was to disclose to the jury that the defendant had been convicted of the charged offense in a prior trial, but the court held that it was properly received because otherwise admissible in that it tended to prove knowledge of the character of marijuana, an essential element in the proof of guilt. The defendant had testified in substance that he was unfamiliar with marijuana cigarettes. "Any evidence which is necessary, pertinent, and material to proof of the crime charged, or which logically and by reasonable inference tends to establish any fact material to the prosecution, is not inadmissible merely because it may prejudice the accused by proof of his guilt of other crimes." (People v. Castellanos, 157 Cal.App.2d 36, 39 [320 P.2d 152].)
 Here, however, the respondent admits, commendably, that the testimony of the probation officer was unnecessary, stating in its brief, "In the Solis case, as here, the probation *192 officer's testimony was not essential to the People's case." The use of a witness, such as a probation officer, with all of the dangers involved by virtue of his previous contacts with defendant in his official capacity, was accordingly unjustified as the jury could have misused such evidence without good cause to defendant's disadvantage. "The rule is one of necessity and the risk of misuse should not be incurred if the evidence is not directed to a disputed issue in the case." (People v. Spencer, 140 Cal.App.2d 97, 105 [294 P.2d 997].)
 Section 1180 of the Penal Code provides: "The granting of a new trial places the parties in the same position as if no trial had been had. All the testimony must be produced anew, and the former verdict or finding cannot be used or referred to, either in evidence or in argument, or be pleaded in bar of any conviction which might have been had under the accusatory pleading." Such mandate applies here. The unnecessary calling and identifying of the probation officer as a witness was an indirect method of using and referring to defendant's former trial; implying prior criminality, it could not have failed to prejudice defendant in the eyes of the jury. Unquestionably, it denied him a fair trial.
 The judgment is reversed.

FOR DEFENDANT‐APPELLANT:                         Gary Jacques, pro se, Danbury, CT.



              Appeal from an order of the United States District Court for the Eastern

District of New York (Gershon, J.).

              UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED,

ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the order of the district court is AFFIRMED.

              Defendant‐appellant Gary Jacques, proceeding pro se, appeals an order

entered January 18, 2019, denying his motion for reduction of his sentence. We assume

the partiesʹ familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and

the issues on appeal.

              In 2010, following a jury trial, Jacques was convicted on multiple drug

trafficking counts and, in a separate criminal proceeding the same year, pled guilty to

wire fraud. In a combined sentencing proceeding, the district court sentenced Jacques

principally to 228 monthsʹ imprisonment on all counts. In 2014, Jacques moved under

18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) for a reduction in his sentence pursuant to Amendment 782 to the

United States Sentencing Guidelines. The district court granted the motion in 2015,

reducing Jacquesʹs sentence to 216 monthsʹ imprisonment.
                                             2
In 2017, Jacques moved for a second reduction under Amendment 782. The district

court denied the motion, concluding that Jacques had not offered an additional ground

for reduction. In 2018, Jacques moved again for what he characterized as either a

further motion for reduction of his sentence or a motion for reconsideration of the

district courtʹs decision on his prior motion, relying on a Ninth Circuit decision, United

States v. Pimentel‐Lopez, 859 F.3d 1134 (9th Cir. 2016). The district court denied the

motion on January 18, 2019, holding that Jacques had not presented any additional

ground for reduction of his sentence and, alternatively, if the motion were considered a

motion for reconsideration, the motion was untimely and meritless because an out‐of‐

Circuit case decided after the district courtʹs 2015 decision reducing Jacquesʹs sentence

was not binding. Jacques appeals.

              We review de novo a district courtʹs determination as to whether a

defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction. See United States v. Christie, 736 F.3d 191,

195 (2d Cir. 2013). Section 3582(c)(2) provides that a sentencing court may reduce a

defendantʹs term of imprisonment if he is eligible for a reduction, that is, if he has been

sentenced based on a guidelines range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing

Commission. See 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). While we have not decided the standard of




                                             3
review for appeals from motions to reconsider denials of § 3582(c)(2) rulings, we need

not do so here because Jacquesʹs appeal fails even on de novo review.1

               The district court did not err by denying Jacquesʹs motion to reduce his

sentence. Jacques had already received a reduction pursuant to Amendment 782, and

he was not eligible for a second reduction because the applicable guidelines range had

not been subsequently lowered by any other amendment. See United States v. Derry, 824

F.3d 299, 304‐07 (2d Cir. 2016) (determining that defendant was not eligible for second

sentence reduction where no subsequent amendment lowered guidelines range from

first reduction).

               Jacques argues that the district court erred by failing to construe his motion

as a motion for reconsideration of the 2015 decision reducing his sentence. While

Jacques correctly notes that he asked the district court to ʺreconsider whether the

sentence imposed (216 months) resulted in a sentence disparity,ʺ Govʹt Appʹx at 239, he

also characterized the motion as a subsequent motion for a sentence reduction (rather

than one seeking reconsideration), sought to apply the legal standards applicable to

resentencing under § 3582 rather than the standards for reconsideration, and raised new




1       See United States v. Delva, 704 Fed. Appʹx 8, 9 (2d Cir. 2017) (ʺThis court has not decided
what standard of review applies to appeals from motions to reconsider denials of § 3582(c)(2)
rulings.ʺ).

                                                 4
arguments. Hence, Jacques viewed the motion as a new motion for a reduction of

sentence.

              Moreover, even assuming the motion was a motion for reconsideration, the

district court did not abuse its discretion in denying it. First, the motion was untimely:

the Eastern Districtʹs local criminal rules require that any motion for reconsideration be

filed within 14 days. E.D.N.Y. Local Crim. R. 49.1(d). The district court decided

Jacquesʹs first sentence reduction motion in September 2015, and Jacques did not make

his third motion ‐‐ the subject of this appeal ‐‐ until June 2018, nearly three years later.

Jacques argues that the Government waived any objection to the timeliness of his motion

by failing to argue it in its response. But given that Jacquesʹs motion did not clearly

argue for reconsideration, the Governmentʹs failure to address the timeliness of the

motion did not constitute waiver. See United States v. Spruill, 808 F.3d 585, 597 (2d Cir.

2015) (ʺ[W]aiver can result only from a [litigantʹs] intentional decision not to assert a

right.ʺ).

              Second, Jacques argues that the district court erred by not considering the

effect of Pimentel‐Lopez, 859 F.3d 1134, on his sentence because courts are permitted to

consider intervening changes in the law on a motion for reconsideration. He is partially

correct. While courts may consider ʺan intervening change in controlling lawʺ on a



                                              5
motion for reconsideration, United States v. Carr, 557 F.3d 93, 102 (2d Cir. 2009), Pimentel‐

Lopez is not controlling. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not abuse

its discretion by determining that the case did not warrant reconsideration of its prior

decision.

                                        *      *    *

                  We have reviewed the remainder of Jacquesʹs arguments and conclude

they are without merit. For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the

district court.

Jennifer ALBERO Plaintiff,
v.
CITY OF SALISBURY, et al., Defendants.
No. CIV. L-03-2425.
United States District Court, D. Maryland.
March 27, 2006.
*550 *551 *552 Kevin M. Tracy, Thomas Edwin Walker, McNamee Hosea Jernigan Kim Greenan and Walker PA, Greenbelt, MD, for Plaintiff.

MEMORANDUM
LEGG, Chief Judge.
Plaintiff, Jennifer Albero ("Albero"), a past employee of the Salisbury Zoo ("Zoo"), brought this Title VII employment discrimination suit against the City of Salisbury and James Rapp ("Rapp"), the Zoo's Director. Following discovery, defendants moved for summary judgment on the two remaining counts of the Complaint, which allege sexual harassment/hostile work environment (Count I), and retaliation (Count III).
Because the papers adequately address the issues, the Court will dispense with a hearing. As is more fully stated below, Albero's proof is legally insufficient to support her claims. With respect to Count I, Albero cannot establish that she was harassed "because of" her sex. Moreover, the Zoo's work environment, while crude, was not severe enough to be considered "hostile." With respect to Count III, Albero did engage in protected activity: filing a complaint of discrimination. The Zoo, however, took no adverse employment action against her in retaliation. Simply put, no fair-minded jury could find in her favor on any of her claims. In a separate Order, therefore, the Court will GRANT the defendants' motion for summary judgment and DIRECT the Clerk to CLOSE the case.
I. BACKGROUND
Albero began working at the Zoo in 1986, when she was hired as a zookeeper. Climbing the ranks, she had been promoted to the position of Zookeeper III, or Senior Zookeeper, at the time she was *553 terminated. In December 2003, Albero took indefinite sick leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act due to a back injury she had sustained in March of that year. The Zoo terminated Albero in June 2004 after she informed the City, through her counsel, that she would seek disability retirement.[1]
Rapp became Zoo director in 1994. Albero appears to have gotten along well with her fellow employees and supervisors until 2001. As will be discussed, Albero and her co-workers socialized both on and off the job. Her employment grievances began in the fall of that year, when Carrie Samis ("Samis"), the Zoo's Education Curator, secured a job reclassification that carried a raise. Samis' raise upset Albero, who believed that Samis did not deserve one, and because no one else at the Zoo received a raise at that time. Albero alleges that Rapp singled out Samis for favoritism because he was involved in a sexual relationship with her. Albero contends that this relationship created a sexually hostile work environment.
In April 2003, Albero filed a grievance with the City complaining that her work environment at the Zoo was hostile. The City promptly assembled an investigative team, which interviewed six current and one former Zoo employee, including Albero, Rapp, and Samis.[2] The investigators compiled a five-page report wherein they made detailed findings as to each of Albero's claims.[3] They found no evidence either that Rapp and Samis were having an affair or that Albero had suffered harassment. The investigators did, however, conclude that the work environment at the Zoo was crude and unprofessional. The Investigation Report states:
"An environment at the Zoo developed over the years that made acceptable discussions and jokes of a sexual nature . . . Sexually explicit language and pictures are not appropriate in the workplace . . . The investigators recommend that remediation occur to change the environment at the Zoo . . . "[4]
The investigators recommended disciplinary action against Rapp for condoning a "sexually explicit" environment.[5] In July 2003, The City issued Rapp a letter of reprimand and instructed him to develop a remediation plan.[6] By all accounts, Rapp took the reprimand to heart. He arranged for all Zoo employees, including himself, to *554 attend a diversity training program. Albero does not allege that the "locker room" atmosphere persisted after the reprimand and the program.
Because the unprofessional atmosphere at the Zoo is at the heart of Albero's hostile work environment claim, it merits a detailed discussion. Albero contends that during working hours, employees frequently told "dirty" jokes. Other employees, including Samis, freely discussed their sex lives.[7] While on vacation, Samis sent a postcard that displayed nude buttocks to the Zoo, and another employee posted the card in the office.[8] During breaks Zoo employees sometimes watched South Park, a satirical, frequently off-color cartoon. Albero contends that one time, she viewed the internet history on a commonuse computer and it contained the address of a pornographic website.[9] The name of the website was vulgar, but no pictures were displayed on the screen.
By her own admission, Albero was a willing participant in the workplace giveand-take.[10] She brought a pornographic video to work, which she showed for a few minutes.[11] She commented to fellow employees, at work, that her showerhead "satisfied" her better than her ex-husband.[12] She told sexual jokes, bragged of a boyfriend's physical "endowments," and participated in purchasing sexual "gag" gifts for colleagues, including edible underwear and an inflatable sheep.[13] On two occasions, she attended strip clubs with other employees after working hours.[14]
In support of her hostile work environment claim, Albero cites to a number of incidents that involved co-workers socializing after-hours and away from the Zoo. Albero states that she witnessed two of these incidents: Rapp once "mooned" fellow employees at a party;[15] another time, at a bar, he kissed the exposed nipple of a man.[16] Albero also cites incidents that she *555 heard about, but did not witness. She heard that Rapp urinated on a car windshield outside a bar,[17] that Samis allegedly played spin-the-bottle with Zoo interns,[18] and that on a business trip Samis's boyfriend spent the night in a hotel room with her and another employee.[19]
The facts underlying Albero's retaliation claim are as follows. Soon after Samis's position was reclassified with a higher pay scale, Albero's relationships with Samis and Rapp became strained. In May 2002, Albero wrote a self-review that was part of her yearly evaluation: "My lack of enthusiasm due to selective, unwarranted raises to certain zoo employees. That creates loads of negativity in the workplace!"[20]
Gary Muir, Albero's direct supervisor, noticed her deteriorating attitude. When grading Albero during her May 2002 evaluation, he gave her a mixed review. Albero received good grades for her work with the animals. Nevertheless, she received low marks for "interpersonal skills"[21] and "professionalism."[22] A couple of days later, Albero met with Rapp about the evaluation, which she perceived as negative.[23]
Eight months later, in January 2003, Albero attended a "Counseling Session" with Rapp and Muir, at which she was counseled on her "antagonistic," "negative," and "hostile" behavior.[24] The "record of counseling" stated that she must "stop making disparaging and hurtful remarks about [her] co-workers and [her] Supervisors," and warned of disciplinary measures if she failed to comply.[25] She refused to sign the record of counseling.[26] Albero contends that no other employee had ever been given such a "mid-year evaluation," and that its purpose was to intimidate her.[27]
Two days later, Rapp issued a memo to all Zoo staff on "Workplace Standards" with rules ranging from the appropriate way to log telephone calls to wearing appropriate safety shoes.[28] In the fall of 2003, he told Albero she could not come in *556 early without her supervisor's permission.[29]
On March 10, 2003, Albero filed a Charge Statement with the EEOC alleging sexual harassment and a hostile work environment.[30] She filed a grievance making similar allegations with the City a month later on April 15, 2003.[31]
On August 20, 2003, Albero filed the instant suit alleging, inter alia, sexual harassment/hostile work environment (Count I) and retaliation (Count III).[32] During this month, she applied and interviewed for an. Education Technician position, which would have placed her under Samis's direct supervision. The hiring committee consisted of Rapp, Samis, and a non-Zoo City employee, Alan Porianda. All three interviewed her. On September 15, 2003, Samis advised Albero by letter that she had not been selected.[33]
Starting in December 2003, Albero took sick leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), because of a back injury she had sustained in March 2003. At that time, Albero filed a second EEOC charge alleging violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and retaliation.[34] Albero then moved to amend her complaint in the instant suit to add a cause of action pursuant to the ADA. She withdrew it soon thereafter, however, and it is not an issue in this suit.
II. STANDARD
The Court may grant summary judgment when "the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); see also Felty v. Graves-Humphreys Co., 818 F.2d 1126, 1128 (4th Cir.1987) (recognizing that trial judges have "an affirmative obligation" to prevent factually unsupported claims and defenses from proceeding to trial). Nevertheless, in determining whether there is a genuine issue of material fact, the Court views the facts, and all reasonable inferences to be drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Pulliam Inv. Co. v. Cameo Properties, 810 F.2d 1282, 1286 (4th Cir.1987).
III. ANALYSIS
With the factual background in mind, the Court now turns its attention to analyzing Albero's claims against the City of Salisbury.[35]
A. Count ISexual Harassment[36]
*557 To succeed on a claim alleging a hostile work environment, Albero must show that: 1) she was harassed because of her sex; 2) the harassment was unwelcome; 3) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create an abusive working environment, and 4) some basis exists to impute liability to the employer. See Smith v. First Union Nat'l Bank, 202 F.3d 234 (4th Cir.2000). Even viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Albero, she does not provide evidence sufficient to meet any element of this test.
1. "Because of Albero's sex
Albero alleges facts that paint a picture of a sexually inappropriate work environment. This, without more, does not rise to the level of a Title VII violation, however. Only harassment that occurs because of the victim's sex is actionable. Hartsell v. Duplex Prod., Inc., 123 F.3d 766, 772 (4th Cir.1997). Title VII does not attempt to "purge the workplace of vulgarity." Hopkins v. Baltimore Gas & Elec., 77 F.3d 745, 753 (4th Cir.1996) (citing Baskerville v. Culligan Int'l Co., 50 F.3d 428, 430 (7th Cir.1995)). Albero has offered no proof that any of the behavior was directed towards her in specific, or intended to humiliate her, or was pointed at her because of her sex. Many incidents that she points to in her pleadings occurred out of her presence. Albero also alleges that the "special" relationship between Samis and Rapp supports her claim for a hostile work environment. She provides no facts to support the assertion that Samis and Rapp had a sexual relationship, however. Samis and Rapp both deny ever having an intimate relationship.[37] No employee ever saw Rapp or Samis engaged in sexual or intimate behavior with each other. There is neither real nor circumstantial evidence to support Albero's allegation. Even viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Albero, she cannot rely on unsupported conjecture to defeat summary judgment.
Albero, therefore, has failed to allege facts sufficient to meet this prong of her prima facie case. That alone is enough to defeat her claim. Nevertheless, in viewing Albero's evidence, the Court finds that she is also unable to establish the other prongs of the Smith test.
2. "Unwelcome"
Conduct is "unwelcome" when it continues after the employee sufficiently communicates that it is unwelcome. See Scott v. Ameritex Yarn, 72 F.Supp.2d 587, 591 (D.S.C.1999) (citing Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 68-69, 106 *558 S.Ct. 2399, 91 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986)). The Court must inquire "whether respondent by her conduct indicated that the alleged [sexual harassment was] unwelcome . . ." Meritor, 477 U.S. at 68, 106 S.Ct. 2399.
Albero's own behavior is relevant in deciding "unwelcomeness." See id. at 69, 106 S.Ct. 2399. The record shows that Albero was a willing participant in many of the episodes, e.g. discussing her own sex life, supplying a pornographic video, and giving sexually-oriented gag-gifts, that she contends were harassing.
Furthermore, there is no evidence that Albero complained about any of the alleged incidents until she filed her first EEOC charge in March 2003. The Zoo did not receive notice of the charge until June 2003.[38] In April 2003, she filed a grievance with the City. The City immediately launched an investigation at the Zoo with a team that included two outside investigators.[39]
Looking at the totality of the circumstances, Albero has failed to present evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that the allegedly harassing behavior was "unwelcome."
3. "Severe and Pervasive"
"To be actionable, sexual harassment must be sufficiently `severe and pervasive' to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment." Raley v. Bd. of St. Mary's Cty. Comm'rs, 752 F.Supp. 1272, 1281 (D.Md.1990). The standard is both objective and subjective: a reasonable person would find the environment hostile and abusive, and the plaintiff "in fact perceived it to be so." Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775 at 787, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (citing Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21-22, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993).) To make this determination, the Court must examine: (i) the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; (ii) the severity of the conduct; (iii) whether the conduct is physically threatening or humiliating, and (iv) whether the conduct unreasonably interferes with the employee's work performance. Id. at 787-88, 118 S.Ct. 2275.
Albero does not allege that Rapp or anyone else at work propositioned her, touched her inappropriately, or made sexual comments in an effort to humiliate her because they knew she would be offended. Nor does she allege that her female colleagues were subjected to such direct misconduct.
Offensive touching or propositioning is not required, however, for a hostile work environment. A worker cannot be forced to endure an atmosphere freighted with sexual references and inappropriate sexual content. See e.g. Meritor, 477 U.S. at 73, 106 S.Ct. 2399 (finding a cause of action for hostile work environment claims when there had been no tangible employment action). If that is the complaint, however, then the sexual overlay must be pervasive and severe. Isolated incidents are not enough. Here, Albero does not say how frequently the objectionable conduct occurred. In other words, she does not attempt to meet the pervasiveness requirement. Her examples come from the 18 years during which she worked at the Zoo. She is vague about dates, and it is unclear whether these incidents were an everyday occurrence or relatively rare. Nor has she shown that the conduct was *559 particularly severe. Moreover, Albero not attempted to show that any of this activity was threatening or humiliating, or that it interfered with her work performance at all.
By requiring that the misconduct must be "severe and pervasive," the Supreme Court sought to prevent Title VII from becoming a "general civility code." Faragher, 524 U.S. at 788, 118 S.Ct. 2275. This prong of the test is meant to "filter out . . . the ordinary tribulations of the workplace, such as the sporadic use of abusive language, gender-related jokes, and occasional teasing." Id. (internal citations omitted). Again, Albero is unable to produce evidence sufficient to meet this part of her prima facie case.
4. Liability imputed to employer
In a hostile work environment claim, liability is generally imputed to the employer. Faragher 524 U.S. at 807, 118 S.Ct. 2275. The employer may, nevertheless, show as an affirmative defense that it "exercised reasonable care to avoid harassment and to eliminate it when it might occur," and that the employee failed to act with "reasonable care to take advantage of the employer's safeguards and otherwise to prevent harm that could have been avoided." Id. at 805, 118 S.Ct. 2275.
While not dispositive, an employer's adoption of an anti-harassment policy is important proof that the employer did exercise reasonable care. Smith, 202 F.3d at 244. The City of Salisbury had in place both a sexual harassment policy and a grievance procedure.[40] Albero has not provided any evidence that the City adopted that policy "in bad faith," or that the policy was "otherwise defective or dysfunctional.", See id. at 245 (citing Brown v. Perry, 184 F.3d 388, 396 (4th Cir.1999)).
Albero did not take advantage of the City's grievance procedures until April 2003, many months, even years, after the instances of "harassment" of which she complains. She did not, the Court notes, file a grievance until after she had already filed an EEOC charge which contained the same allegations. Until that point, she failed to take advantage of the corrective opportunities the City provided. Her actions do not show "reasonable care to take advantage of the employer's safeguards."
Promptly upon the receipt of Albero's grievance letter, the City took steps to investigate her allegations. Although the investigation did not substantiate any of Albero's claims, Rapp was reprimanded for allowing an inappropriate work environment. In addition, the Zoo made sure its employees all had copies of the antiharassment policy.
Albero has not produced any evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that Rapp sexually harassed her, or condoned sexually harassing behavior directed at Albero by her coworkers. She also cannot overcome the City's affirmative defense to liability. Accordingly, summary judgment will be granted as to Count I.
B. Count III Retaliation
To make a prima facie case for retaliation, Albero must produce evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that (1) she engaged in a protected activity; (2) her employer took an adverse employment action against her; and (3) that a causal connection existed between the protected activity and the asserted adverse action. Honor v. Booz-Allen & Hamilton, Inc., 383 F.3d 180, 188 (4th Cir.2004).
Albero makes two different retaliation claims.[41] The first is that she was subject to retaliatory harassment after she *560 filed her first EEOC charge.[42] The second is that she was denied the education technician position in retaliation for filing the EEOC charge. Filing the EEOC charge unequivocally meets the first prong of the prima facie case. The Court will analyze the remainder of the test with respect to both allegations.
1. Harassment
A claim of retaliatory harassment requires a plaintiff to show "evidence of conduct `severe or pervasive enough' to create `an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive.'" Von Gunten v. Maryland, 243 F.3d 858, 869-70 (4th Cir.2001) (quoting Harris, 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct. 367).
As with her hostile work environment/sexual harassment claim, Albero is unable to show that any allegedly retaliatory harassment was "severe and pervasive." She had a mediocre employment evaluation and a counseling session to address her negative attitude. Rapp also promulgated new rules with which all employees had to comply. She was reprimanded once for not speaking to her fellow employees. Even taken together, these incidents do not meet the requirement that the retaliatory behavior be "severe and pervasive."[43]
Essentially, Albero is asking the Court to step in to second-guess managerial decisions, which the Court cannot do. Many of Albero's allegations "can be attributed to an increase of predictable tension in an office after a discrimination charge is filed. This is not an adverse employment action." Raley, 752 F.Supp. at 1281.
2. The Education Technician position
An adverse employment action includes any retaliatory act, but only if that act results in an adverse effect on the "terms, conditions, or benefits" of employment. Von Gunten, 243 F.3d at 865.
Albero fails to make showing. She wished to make the lateral transfer to the Education Technician position.[44] Not *561 being chosen for the position, however, had no effect on the terms, conditions, or benefits of her job as a Zookeeper. She continued to be a Senior Zookeeper, under the same terms, conditions, and benefits she had previously enjoyed.[45] Count III, therefore, cannot survive summary judgment and will be dismissed.
IV. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court will, by separate Order, GRANT Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and DIRECT the Clerk to CLOSE the case.
NOTES
[1]  Letter from Paul Wilber to Kevin Tracy, Def. Ex. 61. (The correspondence is with Albero's attorney, because at this point, she had retained counsel). Albero went on paid FMLA leave in December 2003. Pursuant to City policy, she had to complete a functional capacity evaluation before returning to work. Even after the twelve-week paid leave had expired in April 2004, the City extended her leave status until she could complete the evaluation, in June 2004. Letter from Wilber to Tracy, Def. Ex. 56. The City was willing to accommodate Albero's schedule and choice of doctors, but required the evaluation to assess her ability to return to work. Id. In late April, Albero's counsel advised the City's counsel that Albero would not submit to the functional capacity evaluation in June. Letter from Tracy to Wilber, Def. Ex. 57. The City's attorney wrote back that the City would pay for the evaluation. Letter from Wilber to Tracy, Def. Ex. 58.

[9]  The defendants do not argue a failure to exhaust. Albero's allegations about co-workers, however, may be barred from consideration in this case. An employee cannot file a Title VII case until she has filed an EEOC charge, and the charge frames the scope of future litigation. In Chacko v. Patuxent Institution, the Fourth Circuit held that a plaintiff had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies when the charge referenced different time frames, actors, and discriminatory conduct than the "central factual allegations" in the suit. 429 F.2d 505, 506 (4th Cir.2005). Chacko's EEOC charge complained of specific instances of "hostile treatment" from a supervisor, but at trial he presented evidence that his coworkers constantly subjected him to national origin epithets. Id. at 507-08. The Fourth Circuit reversed a jury verdict in favor of Chacko. In her EEOC charge, Albero contended only that she had been harassed by Rapp and Samis, and that she found their alleged sexual relationship offensive. She did not claim that any other employees harassed her. In this suit, the Court could consider Albero's claims if "a reasonable investigation of the administrative charge would have uncovered the factual allegations in the formal litigation." Id. at 512. The Court need not hypothesize about the scope of a reasonable EEOC investigation, however. With or without the actions of her co-workers other than Samis and Rapp, the alleged harassment does not amount to severe or pervasive conduct. See infra.

[35]  Albero sued Rapp individually. Supervisors are not individually liable for Title VII violations. See Lissau v.Southern Food Serv., Inc., 159 F.3d 177, 181 (4th Cir.1998). Rapp is entitled to summary judgment on that basis alone.
[36]  In her Response to the Motion for Summary Judgment (Docket No. 33), Albero seems to include facts that allege a genderbased disparate treatment claim in addition to her claim for sexual harassment. Albero's complaint does not state a claim for disparate treatment, however. Furthermore, many of her allegations involve the treatment of her female colleagues and not herself. These allegations are irrelevant: "An individual plaintiff in a private, non-class action alleging employment discrimination is not litigating common questions of fact, but the discrete question of whether the employer discriminated against the plaintiff in a specific instance." Honor v. Booz-Allen & Hamilton, Inc., 383 F.3d 180, 190 (4th Cir.2004) (citing Lowery v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., 158 F.3d 742, 761 (4th Cir. 1998), vacated on other grounds 527 U.S. 1031, 119 S.Ct. 2388, 144 L.Ed.2d 790 (1999)). Otherwise, Albero points to decisions made by the management that she felt deprived her of her authority as a Zookeeper. These acts, however, are not in Title VII's purview. The statute does not cover all "unfair or unprofessional" treatment, and does not "prohibit employment decisions based on other factors such as job performance, erroneous evaluations, personality conflicts or even unsound business practices." Porter v. Nat'l Con-Sere, Inc., 51 F.Supp.2d 656, 659-60 (D.Md.1998) (citing Rose-Maston v. NME Hospitals, Inc., 133 F.3d 1104, 1109 (8th Cir. 1998)). The Court takes into account facts alleged about Albero's treatment as part of her hostile work environment claim, but finds that she has not produced evidence to survive summary judgment on a disparate treatment claim.

[39]  As described above, their report, filed in June, found a sexually inappropriate environment at the Zoo, but did not substantiate any of Albero's claims. Nevertheless, Zoo management recommended that Rapp be reprimanded for allowing the inappropriate environment.
[40]  City of Salisbury Maryland Employee Handbook, § 0610, § 0903, § 0904.
[41]  In her response to the motion for summary judgment, (Docket No. 33), Albero seeks to sweep into her retaliation claim conduct that occurred relating to her back injury. For example, she cites the City's request that she take leave under the FMLA and her termination in July 2004 as retaliatory conduct. These disputed matters, however, relate to her 2003 back injury and her ability to perform her work duties after that injury. Accordingly, the only potential "causal connection" is between that conduct and her ADA claim, which Albero withdrew from this case. The Court, therefore, will not consider them and offers no opinion as to whether the ADA proscribes those actions.
[42]  In her first EEOC charge, Albero alleged retaliation for complaining about the treatment of animals at the Zoo. This behavior is not protected under Title VII. The Court also notes that in her retaliation claim, Albero is not alleging retaliatory sexual harassment. Management disallowed all inappropriate behavior after Albero filed her grievance. Albero contends that Rapp and others deliberately made her working environment more difficult.
[43]  Neither the mediocre evaluation nor the counseling session that followed constitutes an adverse employment action. Neither had an effect on the terms, benefits, or condition of her employment. For example, Albero was not demoted or denied a raise because of them. Moreover, these two events occurred between January 2002 and January 2003, before she filed her EEOC charge and grievance letter. Accordingly, they cannot be said to be in retaliation for her complaints of sexual harassment. Nor do Albero's complaints in the January 2002 Workplace Evaluation and in her May 2002 self-review qualify as "protected activity" under Title VII. She complained of favoritism, but made no allegations of sexual harassment or gender discrimination. Making general workplace complaints is not protected activity.
[44]  It does not appear that this position was a promotion. The pay was $10,000 less than what Albero was making as a Senior Zookeeper. Advertisement for Education Technician position, Def. Ex. 22.
[45]  Even assuming, arguendo, that this was an adverse employment action, Albero cannot show that the failure to hire her was retaliatory. Once a plaintiff has shown an adverse employment action, the burden shifts to the employer to show a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for not hiring her. See Smith, 202 F.3d at 248. The plaintiff must then show that reason is pretextual by demonstrating "both that the reason was false and that [retaliation] was the real reason for the challenged conduct." Id. (emphasis added; internal citations omitted). The hiring team stated that the woman they hired was the most qualified for the position: she has a bachelor's degree, teaching experience, and enthusiasm for working with the public. Had Albero gotten the position, Samis would have been her supervisor. Samis also felt that her past personality conflicts with Albero weighed against Albero's candidacy. In addition, Albero stated in the January 2002 Workplace Questionnaire (Def.Ex. 1) that working with the public was the aspect of her job that she disliked the most. Working with the public was at the core of the Education Technician position. Albero has not shown that these legitimate reasons were merely a pretext for retaliation.

No. 73376.

Gregory Upchurch, pro se.
William L. Webster, Atty. Gen., James B. Deutsch, Deputy Atty. Gen., Simon B. Buckner, Asst. Atty. Gen., Jefferson City, for respondents.
COVINGTON, Judge.
Relator Gregory Upchurch appeals the dismissal by the Circuit Court of Cole County of his petition for a writ of mandamus against the Secretary of State of Missouri and for a judgment of declaration that § 116.332.1, RSMo 1986,[1] is unconstitutional. Reversed.
Relator sought to circulate for signatures an initiative petition to place a proposed amendment to the Missouri Constitution on the ballot for the November 4, 1992, general election. On November 13, 1990, relator submitted a sample petition to Secretary of State Roy D. Blunt. Section 116.332.1 requires that, before a constitutional amendment petition may be circulated for signatures, a sample sheet be submitted to the secretary of state in the form in which the petition will be circulated, for approval by the secretary of state.
On the day of receipt of the sample petition, the secretary of state notified relator that the secretary could not accept the sample petition because "[f]or the November, *516 1992 general election the earliest a sample petition may be submitted for approval is July 3, 1991." The secretary of state relied upon a subsequent requirement of § 116.332.1 that provides: "The sample petition may not be submitted to the secretary of state more than one year prior to the final date for filing the signed petition with the secretary of state."
Relator instituted this proceeding in the circuit court on November 29, 1990. The gravamen of his claim is that the one year limitation of § 116.332.1 is inconsistent with the reservation of the initiative power to the people in Article III, § 49, of the Missouri Constitution.
Respondents moved to dismiss claiming inappropriateness of mandamus to litigate the action, absence of a justiciable controversy, and constitutionality of the subject statutory provision. The trial court dismissed relator's petition. The basis for the dismissal is not evident from the record.[2] This Court reviews the matter as an appeal from the dismissal of relator's petition for declaratory judgment. The case involves the validity of the one year limitation contained in § 116.332.1. This Court has jurisdiction. Mo. Const. art. V, § 3.
Rules employed in construction of constitutional provisions are the same as those employed in construction of statutes. Crucial words must be viewed in context, and courts must assume that words were used purposefully. The selection of words as arranged by the drafters is indicative of the significance of the words employed. Boone County Court v. State, 631 S.W.2d 321, 324 (Mo. banc 1982). This Court is required to give due regard to the primary objectives of the constitutional provision under scrutiny, as viewed in harmony with all related provisions. State ex inf. of Martin v. City of Independence, 518 S.W.2d 63, 66 (Mo.1974). If a statute conflicts with a constitutional provision or provisions, this Court must hold that the statute is invalid. Rekart v. Kirkpatrick, 639 S.W.2d 606, 608 (Mo. banc 1982).
The analysis begins with the people's reservation to themselves of the "power to propose and enact or reject laws and amendments to the constitution by initiative, independent of the general assembly... except as hereinafter provided." Mo. Const. art. III, § 49. Although the constitution first reserves to the people the initiative power, the constitution by subsequent provisions involves the general assembly in the procedure of submitting initiatives. In submitting initiatives to the people, "the secretary of state and all other officers shall be governed by general laws." Mo. Const. art. III, § 53. All amendments proposed by the initiative "shall be submitted to the electors for their approval or rejection by official ballot title as may be provided by law...." Mo. Const. art. XII, § 2(b). These provisions require the application of general law, as enacted by the general assembly, to the process of submitting initiatives to the people. Presumably under authority of these constitutional provisions, the general assembly enacted laws contained in Chapter 116 relating to initiative and referendum, including § 116.332.1, at issue here.
Seeking to sustain the constitutionality of the subject statute, respondents assert that, absent constitutional direction as to the length of time during which proponents of a petition may circulate for signatures, either there is no limitation on the circulation period or the limitation must be supplied from another source. Respondents argue that, since no constitutional direction exists, the general assembly through § 116.332.1 properly supplies a limitation on the circulation period. Respondents appropriately note that a legislative body's power to enact reasonable implementations of a constitutional directive is generally recognized. Respondents also correctly contend that the Missouri General Assembly generally possesses plenary power to enact legislation, and that the legislature *517 frequently enacts time limitations to implement constitutional language. Respondents contend that the Missouri scheme is consistent with that of other states and that the history of the adoption of the initiative procedures reflects that the general assembly was expected to enact implementing legislation.
As respondents forthrightly acknowledge, each of their arguments rests upon their stated premise that the constitution is silent on the question of the period of time in which petitions can be circulated for signatures. That premise is faulty. The constitution does provide a limited period.
Constitutional provisions relating to the period of time during which petitions may be circulated for signatures are clearly framed by reference to general elections and the periods between them. The final date for obtaining signatures is established by Mo. Const. art. III, § 50: Initiative petitions proposing amendments to the constitution must be "filed with the secretary of state not less than four months before the election...." (Emphasis added). Article XII, § 2(b), fixes the date before which signatures may not be obtained: "All amendments proposed by the general assembly or by the initiative shall be submitted to the electors for their approval or rejection by official ballot title as may be provided by law, on a separate ballot without party designation, at the next general election, or at a special election called by the governor prior thereto, at which he may submit any of the amendments." (Emphasis added). Under this provision, unless a special election is called by the governor, an amendment is submitted at the next general election, and the time in which to submit the sample petition is effectively limited only by the period between general elections. Concomitantly, it is clear that the constitution permits submission of sample initiative petitions to the secretary of state from any time after one general election until four months prior to the next general election. Although the authority is not semantically explicit, the constitutional provisions are nonetheless plain in meaning.
Respondents' arguments, therefore, necessarily fail because the constitution does provide a period in which the petitions can be circulated. Any limitation of the period authorized is in conflict and invalid. That part of § 116.332.1 that limits submission to the secretary of state of a sample petition to one year prior to the final date for filing the signed petition with the secretary, and thereby shortens the time authorized by the constitution during which the constitutional amendment petition may be circulated for signatures, is invalid.
The judgment is reversed.
BLACKMAR, C.J., and ROBERTSON, RENDLEN, HIGGINS, HOLSTEIN, JJ., and TURNAGE, Special Judge, concur.

PER CURIAM.


1
The order of the court below admitting the appellee to citizenship was entered on February 19, 1948.  The amendment to Rule 73(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A., changing the time within which an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals may be taken from three months to sixty days in cases where the United States is a party became effective on March 19, 1948.  The government took no appeal until May 10, 1948, or about eighty-one days after the entry of the original order.  It seeks to be excepted from the shortened time provided by the amendment for taking its appeal because of Rule 86(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which limits it to the time prescribed by the amendment except to the extent that in the opinion of the court the application of the shortened time to a 'particular action pending when the amendments take effect would not be feasible or would work injustice.'  It is not claimed that the government was not aware of the new rule, but only that its activities were too numerous or its departments too busy to make a final decision whether to take the appeal prior to the time when it was finally taken.  After the new rule became effective the government still had thirty days in which to make its decision and, as it knew the law and the facts, it was not in our opinion entitled to exemption from application of the new rule.  It in fact waited for eighty-one days after the entry of the judgment, and about fifty-two days after the amendment to Rule 73(a) became effective, before acting.  We can see no excuse for such a delay, and regard the situation as substantially different from that which we dealt with in McAllister v. Cosmopolitan Shipping Co., 2 Cir., 169 F.2d 4, where the application of the new rule would have given the appellant only about a week within which to take his appeal.  The situation here resembles that in the case of Smith v. Lehigh Valley R. Co., 2 Cir., 174 F.2d 592, in which we declined to extend the appellant's time under Rule 86(b).

The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

Phill Elvin GRANT, Jr., Plaintiff,
v.
Robert Grant PITCHFORD, et al., Defendants.
Civ. No. 81-0629-G(M).
United States District Court, S.D. California.
May 2, 1983.
Leyon D. Sakey, Susan Hildebrand, San Diego, Cal., for plaintiff.
Peter K. Nunez, U.S. Atty., Peter W. Bowie, Chief Asst. U.S. Atty., San Diego, Cal., for defendants.

MEMORANDUM DECISION
GILLIAM, District Judge.
On June 5, 1981, plaintiff Grant caused to be filed in the Superior Court for the State of California a "complaint for damages for assault & battery, conspiracy, dereliction of duty & intentional infliction of emotional distress." Named as defendants in that complaint were Robert Grant Pitchford, John F. Kelley, William C. Hughes, Jr., and some fictitiously named persons.
The first cause of action in plaintiff's complaint alleged that defendant Pitchford committed a battery upon plaintiff by striking plaintiff with a hammer. In that same cause of action, plaintiff also alleged that defendant Kelley ratified the acts of defendant Pitchford by failing to take any action against him. Further, Mr. Grant alleged that defendant Hughes authorized the acts of defendant Pitchford "by allowing *431 him to continue in a position of authority even though defendant Hughes knew or should have known" of defendant Pitchford's alleged violent propensities.
The second cause of action set out in plaintiff's state court complaint alleged that defendants Hughes and Kelley "conspired ... to take no action" to stop defendant Pitchford or to punish him for his alleged conduct. Plaintiff Grant also alleged that defendant Hughes ratified defendant Pitchford's alleged acts by not reporting them to superiors.
Plaintiff's third cause of action alleged that defendant Hughes negligently supervised defendant Pitchford and that the breach of that duty owed to plaintiff resulted in the injuries he allegedly sustained.
Following delivery of the state court process to one or more of the defendants, on July 8, 1981 counsel for defendants filed a petition for removal of the suit to this court. The petition recited in relevant part that defendant Hughes was at all pertinent times a member of the Armed Forces serving as the Commanding Officer of the USS FLASHER (SSN 613). Removal authority and jurisdiction was therefore invoked under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1442, 1442a.
Subsequently, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment. In that motion the defendants first made it a matter of record that plaintiff Grant was a third class petty officer in the U.S. Navy, on active duty and stationed aboard the USS FLASHER. The moving papers set forth that defendant Hughes was Commanding Officer of the FLASHER; established that defendant Kelley was a junior officer on board the FLASHER; and showed that defendant Pitchford was the Chief of the Boat aboard the FLASHER. Lastly, the moving papers disclosed that the alleged acts, to the extent of their actual occurrence, happened on board the FLASHER while it was underway and entering port.
Because of the foregoing facts, the essence of the defendants' motion was that plaintiff's suit was barred by the doctrine of intra-military immunity as embodied in Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135, 71 S.Ct. 153, 95 L.Ed. 152 (1950), and as extended to individual defendants in Bailey v. Van Buskirk, 345 F.2d 298 (9th Cir.1965), cert. denied, 383 U.S. 948, 86 S.Ct. 1205, 16 L.Ed.2d 210 (1966), and Tirrill v. McNamara, 451 F.2d 579 (9th Cir.1971). The defendants argued in their motion that because plaintiff Grant was on active duty in the Navy serving on board the USS FLASHER at the time of the alleged incident the Feres doctrine barred the suit regardless of whether the defendants' conduct was characterized as negligent or intentional.
Plaintiff Grant filed no opposition to the defendants' motion. Instead, he caused to be filed a first amended complaint, styled as one "For Violation of Federal Civil Rights; Assault & Battery, Conspiracy, Dereliction of Duty, Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress." Much of what was alleged in plaintiff's original complaint was repeated, verbatim, in the First Amended Complaint. More to the point, the same conduct of each of the defendants which was urged to support plaintiff's state tort claims in the original complaint is the conduct of which plaintiff complains in his First Amended Complaint, although he now alleges that the conduct was also violative of his constitutional rights.
Following service of the First Amended Complaint, the defendants, on December 4, 1981, filed a new motion to dismiss or for summary judgment. In essence, the defendants' position is that plaintiff's First Amended Complaint is an attempt to put a constitutional gloss on what are, in reality, state tort claims, and that plaintiff should not be permitted to evade the rule of Feres v. United States, supra, by engaging in an exercise in artful pleading. Defendants' motion was noticed for hearing before this court on February 22, 1982.
On approximately January 27, 1982 plaintiff caused to be filed and noticed for hearing before Magistrate McCue motions for a continuance, to compel attendance at a deposition, and to compel production of certain documents. Those motions were noticed *432 for hearing on February 16, 1982. Plaintiff contended, in essence, that there was discovery he needed to counter the defendants' motion set before this court.
Defendants, in turn, obtained an order shortening time and filed and served a motion for protective order which was heard by Magistrate McCue on February 3, 1982. The defendants contended that none of the discovery sought by plaintiff related to any of the issues raised by the motion to dismiss or for summary judgment. Because the discovery was not relevant to those issues, and because the motion to dismiss, if granted, would be dispositive of the case, said the defendants, discovery should be stayed pending resolution of the dispositive motion unless the plaintiff could show how the discovery was necessary to respond to the motion. Magistrate McCue agreed with the defendants' position and ordered that the requested discovery not go forward pending resolution of the motion to dismiss. Subsequently, plaintiff withdrew his motions for continuance and to compel attendance at the proposed deposition. The defendants' motion to dismiss or for summary judgment thereafter came on regularly for hearing before this court on February 22, 1982. For the reasons set out hereafter, the court finds that the defendants' motion is well taken and should be granted.
In Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135, 71 S.Ct. 153, 95 L.Ed. 152 (1950) the Supreme Court held that a serviceman who is injured as a result of the negligence of fellow servicemen and "the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service ..." will not be permitted to sue the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act. That rule continues in full force. Stencel Aero Engineering Corp. v. United States, 431 U.S. 666, 97 S.Ct. 2054, 52 L.Ed.2d 665 (1977); Uptegrove v. United States, 600 F.2d 1248, 1251 (9th Cir.1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1044, 100 S.Ct. 732, 62 L.Ed.2d 730 (1980).
It has long been recognized by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, as well as by other courts, that the rationale of the Feres rule applies as much to suits brought by injured servicemen against individual federal employees as it does to suits against the United States. Bailey v. Van Buskirk, 345 F.2d 298 (9th Cir.1965), cert. denied, 383 U.S. 948, 86 S.Ct. 1205, 16 L.Ed.2d 210 (1966); Tirrill v. McNamara, 451 F.2d 579 (9th Cir.1971); Calhoun v. United States, 475 F.Supp. 1 (S.D.Cal.1977), aff'd per curiam, 604 F.2d 647 (9th Cir.1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1078, 100 S.Ct. 1029, 62 L.Ed.2d 761 (1980); Bailey v. De Quevedo, 375 F.2d 72 (3d Cir.1967), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 923, 88 S.Ct. 247, 19 L.Ed.2d 274 (1967); Stanley v. Central Intelligence Agency, 639 F.2d 1146, 1152 (5th Cir.1981).
Central to a determination of whether the Feres rule applies in any particular case is whether the plaintiff sustained the claimed injuries incident to his military service. A review of the applicable cases discloses that resolution of this inquiry turns, in essence, upon whether at the time he sustained the injury the plaintiff was where he was because of his relationship to the military. See Uptegrove v. United States, supra; Shults v. United States, 421 F.2d 170 (5th Cir.1969); Vallance v. United States, 574 F.2d 1282 (5th Cir.1978); Veillette v. United States, 615 F.2d 505 (9th Cir.1980); Chambers v. United States, 357 F.2d 224 (8th Cir.1966); Stansberry v. Middendorf, 567 F.2d 617 (4th Cir.1978); Camassar v. United States, 531 F.2d 1149 (2d Cir.1976).
In the instant case, it is undisputed that plaintiff was on active duty aboard the USS FLASHER while it was underway at the time of the alleged incident. In other words, plaintiff was where he was at the time of the incident precisely because of his military relationship. It is also undisputed that each of the defendants was similarly on active duty aboard USS FLASHER at the time of the alleged event. Accordingly, the court finds that the elements of the Feres rule have been met and that if the rule applies at all, it applies to bar the instant suit.
Plaintiff argues, however, that the Feres rule should not be applied in the instant case because plaintiff has, in his First *433 Amended Complaint, asserted his claims as violations of the Constitution of the United States, to which he contends the Feres rule does not apply. In so arguing, plaintiff relies on the recent decision in Wallace v. Chappell, 661 F.2d 729 (9th Cir.1981).
Plaintiff has, indeed, attempted to recast his claims as violations of the Constitution. However, such efforts are unavailing. Where, as here, a plaintiff's theory of constitutional deprivation is simply a "restatement" of a state tort cause of action, courts have generally declined to recognize a constitutional cause of action. Calhoun v. United States, 475 F.Supp. 1 (S.D.Cal.1977), aff'd per curiam, 604 F.2d 647 (9th Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1078, 100 S.Ct. 1029, 62 L.Ed.2d 761 (1980); Misko v. United States, 453 F.Supp. 513 (D.D.C.1978), aff'd, 593 F.2d 1371 (D.C.Cir.1979). In so holding, the courts have been mindful of the instruction of the Supreme Court in Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976). In that case, a plaintiff urged that a state tort claim for defamation really constituted a deprivation of a constitutionally protected right. In rejecting that contention, the Court wrote:
But such a reading would make of the Fourteenth Amendment a font of tort law to be superimposed upon whatever systems may already be administered by the States. We have noted the "constitutional shoals" that confront any attempt to derive from congressional civil rights statutes a body of general federal tort law, Griffin v. Breckenridge, 403 U.S. 88, 101-102 [91 S.Ct. 1790, 1797-1798, 29 L.Ed.2d 338] (1971); a fortiori, the procedural guarantees of the Due Process Clause cannot be the source for such law.
424 U.S. at 701, 96 S.Ct. at 1160. Comparison of plaintiff's original complaint filed in state court with the First Amended Complaint now before this court discloses that both are virtually identical, particularly in terms of the alleged conduct of the defendants. The court concludes that plaintiff has simply attempted to recast traditional state tort claims as constitutional violations. Under the circumstances of this case, no constitutional claim is alleged sufficient to support a cause of action under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).
The recent decision of Wallace v. Chappell, 661 F.2d 729 (9th Cir.1981) does not compel a contrary conclusion. Rather, the Wallace court itself recognized the foregoing when it wrote:
With respect to constitutional claims, therefore, our adoption of the Mindes [v. Seaman, 453 F.2d 197 (5th Cir.1971)] test is limited to cases in which the plaintiff has alleged what the Calhoun court described as a "recognized" constitutional right. We do not mean by this term to eliminate from consideration those constitutional claims that have not yet been accepted by the courts. We mean only that the allegations must amount to more than a traditional state law claim.
661 F.2d at 734. Having concluded that plaintiff has alleged only traditional state tort claims, although he has attempted to recast them as constitutional violations, it is clear that Wallace v. Chappell, supra, is not applicable to the instant case.
Inasmuch as defendants have established through uncontroverted declarations that plaintiff's alleged injuries were sustained incident to his military service on board USS FLASHER, and since there is no bar to application of the Feres rule to what are, in essence, state tort claims, the court finds that the Feres rule bars the instant suit.
Accordingly, defendants' motion to dismiss is granted. Stanley v. Central Intelligence Agency, 639 F.2d 1146 (5th Cir.1981). Alternatively, it has been established that defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law based upon their uncontroverted declarations and the applicable law. Therefore, defendants' alternative motion for summary judgment is granted as well.

 L’CHAIM HOUSE, INC. et al.,

 v.
 DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS                       (Sonoma County
 ENFORCEMENT,                                      Super. Ct. No. SCV-259820)
          Defendant and Respondent.


        Plaintiffs L’Chaim House, Inc. and its owner, Cary Kopstein (collectively,
L’Chaim), operate residential care homes for seniors. L’Chaim was cited for wage and
hour violations by defendant Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE). After an
unsuccessful administrative appeal, L’Chaim initiated this action by filing a petition for a
writ of administrative mandamus under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, which
the trial court denied.
        On appeal, L’Chaim claims that under the applicable Industrial Welfare
Commission (IWC) wage order, it may require its employees to work “on-duty” meal
periods that, unlike periods when employees are “relieved of all duty,” do not need to be
at least 30 minutes long. (IWC wage order No. 5-2001 (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, § 11050)
(hereafter Wage Order No. 5), subd. (11)(A), (E).) We hold that, to the contrary,
L’Chaim must provide meal periods of at least 30 minutes, regardless of whether they are
on-duty or off-duty, under Wage Order No. 5 and the applicable statutory law. We
therefore affirm.

                                 FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL
                                      BACKGROUND
       Because this appeal presents a pure question of law, we need not discuss the
underlying facts in detail. Briefly, in February 2016, the DLSE issued wage and penalty
citations to L’Chaim, which operates two 24-hour residential care homes in San Rafael
for seniors. The citations were for, among other things, failing to provide 30-minute
meal periods under Wage Order No. 5, which governs the public housekeeping industry.
A hearing officer affirmed the citations, which included a total of approximately $89,000
in premium-pay and penalty assessments under Labor Code sections 226.7 and 558 for
failure to provide 30-minute meal periods to employees. 1
       In December 2016, L’Chaim filed the instant action, challenging only the
conclusion that it failed to provide meal periods as required. The following September,
the trial court denied the writ petition. It concluded that even though L’Chaim was
authorized to provide on-duty, as opposed to off-duty, meal periods to its employees,
those meal periods still had to be at least 30 minutes long.
                                              II.
                                         DISCUSSION
       A.       The Standard of Review and Governing Law.
       A writ of administrative mandamus may be sought on the basis that the agency
engaged in a “prejudicial abuse of discretion. Abuse of discretion is established if the
[agency] has not proceeded in the manner required by law.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5,
subd. (b).) “Generally, whether an agency has proceeded lawfully is a legal question that
the trial court and appellate court both review de novo.” (Stewart Enterprises, Inc. v.
City of Oakland (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 410, 420.) We agree with the parties that
L’Chaim’s sole claim—that the on-duty meal breaks authorized by subdivision 11(E) of
Wage Order No. 5 do not need to be least 30 minutes long—presents an issue of statutory




       1
           All further statutory references are to the Labor Code unless otherwise noted.

                                               2
interpretation that we review de novo. (See Robertson v. Health Net of California, Inc.
(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 1419, 1425.)
       “We apply the usual rules of statutory interpretation to the Labor Code, beginning
with and focusing on the text as the best indicator of legislative purpose. [Citation.] ‘[I]n
light of the remedial nature of the legislative enactments authorizing the regulation of
wages, hours[,] and working conditions for the protection and benefit of employees, the
statutory provisions are to be liberally construed with an eye to promoting such
protection.’ ” (Brinker Restaurant Corp. v. Superior Court (2012) 53 Cal.4th 1004,
1026–1027 (Brinker).) Similarly, when, as here, “a wage order’s validity and application
are conceded and the question is only one of interpretation, the usual rules of statutory
interpretation apply,” and the wage order “must be interpreted in the manner that best
effectuates [the] . . . intent [to protect workers].” (Id. at p. 1027.) “To the extent a wage
order and a statute overlap, we will seek to harmonize them, as we would with any two
statutes.” (Ibid.)
       Wage Order No. 5, subdivision 11(A) provides, “No employer shall employ any
person for a work period of more than five (5) hours without a meal period of not less
than 30 minutes, except that when a work period of not more than six (6) hours will
complete the day’s work the meal period may be waived by mutual consent of the
employer and the employee. Unless the employee is relieved of all duty during a 30
minute meal period, the meal period shall be considered an ‘on duty’ meal period and
counted as time worked. An ‘on duty’ meal period shall be permitted only when the
nature of the work prevents an employee from being relieved of all duty and when by
written agreement between the parties an on-the-job paid meal period is agreed to. The
written agreement shall state that the employee may, in writing, revoke the agreement at
any time.”
       Subdivision 11(E) of Wage Order No. 5 creates an exception for “employees of 24
hour residential care facilities for the elderly,” which the DLSE concedes applies to
L’Chaim’s employees. Under that provision, such employees “may be required to work
on-duty meal periods without penalty when necessary to meet regulatory or approved


                                              3
program standards and one of the following two conditions is met: [¶] (1) [¶] (a) The
residential care employee[] eats with residents during residents’ meals and the employer
provides the same meal at no charge to the employee; or [¶] (b) The employee is in sole
charge of the resident(s) and, on the day shift, the employer provides a meal at no charge
to the employee.” (Wage Order No. 5, subd. 11(E).)
       In 1999, the Legislature regulated meal periods for the first time by passing
section 512, which “made meal periods a statutory as well as a wage order obligation.”
(Brinker, supra, 53 Cal.4th at pp. 1036–1037.) Before that, “an employer’s meal periods
were governed solely by the language of the IWC’s wage orders.” (Id. at p. 1034.) “The
declared intent in enacting section 512,” which was done in response to the IWC’s
“weakening of employee protections” in certain wage orders, “was not to revise existing
meal period rules but to codify them in part.” (Id. at pp. 1037–1038.) Under the statute,
“[a]n employer shall not employ an employee for a work period of more than five hours
per day without providing the employee with a meal period of not less than 30 minutes,
except that if the total work period per day of the employee is no more than six hours, the
meal period may be waived by mutual consent of both the employer and employee.”
(§ 512, subd. (a).) 2
       B.      The On-duty Meal Periods Authorized by Subdivision 11(E) Must Be at
               Least 30 Minutes Long.
       L’Chaim’s claim that it does not have to provide on-duty meal periods that are 30
minutes long rests on a fundamental misreading of subdivision 11 of Wage Order No. 5.
As noted above, subdivision 11(A) states that “[u]nless the employee is relieved of all
duty during a 30 minute meal period, the meal period shall be considered an ‘on duty’
meal period and counted as time worked.” L’Chaim interprets this language to
“contemplate[] instances where an employee’s meal period may be less than 30 minutes,”
in which case subdivision 11(A) “does not extend the meal period until a full


       2
        Effective January 1, 2019, the word “shall” was substituted for “may” (Stats.
2018, ch. 48, § 1), but the quoted language has otherwise remained the same since 1999.
(See Stats. 1999, ch. 134, § 6; Brinker, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 1037, fn. 16.)

                                             4
uninterrupted 30 minutes is realized” or “require a tolling of the 30-minute meal period
while the employee carries out some of his or her duties.” We do not follow this
reasoning. If an employee is entitled to an off-duty meal period of 30 minutes, yet work
obligations intrude on a portion of that time, the off-duty period is converted to an on-
duty period—no matter how small the portion of the period that work intruded upon—
and the employee is paid for the entire period. There is no suggestion that once work
interrupts an employee’s meal period, the period simply ends even if 30 minutes have not
yet passed.
       Thus, we cannot agree with L’Chaim that the trial court’s determination that its
employees are entitled to an on-duty meal period of at least 30 minutes equates to an
“imputation of a 30-minute uninterrupted meal period into an ‘on-duty’ meal period.”
The court’s order says no such thing. Instead, it merely concludes that an employee
subject to subdivision 11(E) is still entitled to a 30-minute meal period even though that
meal period may be on-duty instead of off-duty.
       What L’Chaim misunderstands is that an on-duty meal period is not the functional
equivalent of no meal period at all. On-duty meal periods are an intermediate category
requiring more of employees than off-duty meal periods but less of employees than their
normal work. Recognizing this, the trial court stated that even if L’Chaim’s employees
were not entitled to “an uninterrupted meal period,” they “may at least be afforded 30[]
minutes of limited duty enabling them to eat their meal in relative peace.” L’Chaim
attacks the notion that its “employees may be given ‘limited duty’ while on a meal break”
as creating “several absurd consequences.” According to L’Chaim, because employees
do not clock out for on-duty meal periods, there is no way to track the length of those
periods. In addition, “the creation of a new ‘limited duty’ requirement to [Wage Order
No. 5, subdivision 11(E)] would force employers to delineate which tasks an employee is
expected to perform during his or her on-duty meal period,” which L’Chaim claims
“would be difficult and even potentially dangerous for the residents.”
       But any such practical challenges are inherent in providing “on-duty meal periods”
at all, not just periods of a particular length. Moreover, the question presented here is


                                              5
whether an on-duty meal period must be at least 30 minutes long, not how courts might
evaluate the adequacy of the period under different factual scenarios. Thus, while we do
not address what constitutes an acceptable on-duty meal period in the context of this case,
what we can say is that employees of 24-hour residential care facilities for seniors are
unambiguously entitled to “on-duty meal periods” under subdivision 11(E). L’Chaim’s
interpretation would effectively read that requirement out of Wage Order No. 5.
       L’Chaim also seizes on broad language in an appellate decision and a DLSE
opinion letter that it claims supports its position. In Palacio v. Jan & Gail’s Care Homes,
Inc. (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1133 (Palacio), the Fifth District Court of Appeal
considered the interplay between subdivisions 11(A) and 11(E). Subdivision 11(A) is a
general provision that allows employers and employees to agree that meal periods will be
on-duty and to revoke these voluntary agreements at any time. (Palacio, at p. 1139.)
Subdivision 11(E), in contrast, “enables employers to require employees to work on-duty
meal periods, provided certain conditions are met.” (Ibid.) The Palacio employer
required its employees to work on-duty meal periods under subdivision 11(E) and to sign
agreements waiving their right to off-duty meal periods. Palacio held that the employer
“was not obligated to comply with subdivision 11(A)” by including a provision in the
agreements giving the employees the right to revoke them. (Palacio, at pp. 1140–1141.)
Similarly, in an October 17, 2016 opinion letter, the DLSE responded to the question
“whether a meal period waiver is required to be signed by employees exempt from duty
free meal periods under [subdivision 11(E)]” by reference to Palacio. The letter
characterized Palacio as holding that the right-to-revoke language is not required in such
a waiver “because if a care home meets the requirements of [subdivision] 11(E) it does
not also need to comply with [subdivision] 11(A).”
       L’Chaim argues that the statements in Palacio and the DLSE opinion letter
establish that an employer whose employees are covered by Wage Order No. 5,
subdivision 11(E) are exempt from complying with any part of subdivision 11(A),
including the requirement that meal periods be at least 30 minutes long. We would have
to read these statements wholly divorced from their context to accept L’Chaim’s


                                             6
interpretation, and we decline to do so. Subdivision 11(E) creates an exception to
subdivision 11(A) by authorizing an employer to mandate on-duty meal periods without
the need to reach a revocable waiver agreement with its employees, and Palacio
addressed only the portion of subdivision 11(A) that subdivision 11(E) purports to affect,
the portion governing waivers of off-duty meal periods. (See Palacio, supra,
242 Cal.App.4th at p. 1139.) It is axiomatic that “ ‘cases are not authority for
propositions not considered.’ ” (City of Bellflower v. Cohen (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 438,
452.) The only reasonable reading of Palacio’s statement is that if a care home meets the
requirements of subdivision 11(E) it does not also need to comply with the portion of
subdivision 11(A) governing waivers of off-duty meal periods, not subdivision 11(A) as a
whole.
         Finally, even if any doubt remained, we agree with the DLSE that section 512
compels the same conclusion. Under that statute, which L’Chaim does not address in its
briefing, an employer is prohibited from “employ[ing] an employee for a work period of
more than five hours per day without providing the employee with a meal period of not
less than 30 minutes,” unless the employee works no more than six hours in a day and
agrees to waive the meal period. (§ 512, subd. (a).) Although section 512 contains
exceptions for workers in several industries, none of them apply here. And although the
IWC has broad authority to “adopt or amend working condition orders with respect to . . .
meal periods . . . for any workers in California consistent with the health and welfare of
those workers,” at all relevant times—including when subdivision 11(E) was added to
Wage Order No. 5—that authority has been specifically limited “as provided in
Section 512.” (§ 516, subd. (a); see Gerard v. Orange Coast Memorial Medical Center
(2018) 6 Cal.5th 443, 454–455 [post-2000, IWC cannot “deviate from the meal period
requirements of section 512”]; Official Notice, Amends. to §§ 3, 11, 12 of Wage Order
No. 5 (Oct. 29, 2001).) Thus, absent a waiver, the statute’s plain terms required L’Chaim
to provide “a meal period”—whether off-duty or on-duty—of at least 30 minutes any
time an employee worked at least five hours.

                              CONCURRENCE OF BANKE, J.
       Although I concur in the majority’s opinion, I write separately to emphasize what
an exceptionally poor vehicle this case is to discuss the parameters of a lawful “on-duty”
meal period and to underscore the narrowness of our holding.
       First, the employer never raised, until well after the eleventh hour, any exception
to the general rule that employees must be provided unpaid, 30-minute “off-duty” meal
periods every five hours. 1 (See Gerard, supra, 6 Cal.5th at p. 446 [“Labor Code
generally provides that employees who work more than five hours must be provided with
a 30-minute meal period”].) The employer raised no exception during the months-long
audit, and the citation issued by the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE)
alleged violations of the general rule, i.e., failing to provide 30-minute “off-duty” meal
periods. The employer invoked no exception in response, and instead, requested a
hearing. The DLSE then tried the case as one where employees were entitled to, but not
provided with, uninterrupted 30-minute “off-duty” meal periods, during which they were
free to leave the premises. (See Brinker Restaurant Corp. v. Superior Court (2012)
53 Cal.4th 1004, 1035–1040 (Brinker).) The DLSE thus made a well-focused evidentiary
presentation that, during the audit period, the employer had no meal period policies at all,


       1
          DLSE wage order No. 5-2001 (Wage Order No. 5) provides three exceptions.
The first, set forth in subdivision (11)(A), applies when “the nature of the work prevents
an employee from being relieved of all duty,” the employee agrees in writing to “on-the-
job” paid meal periods, and the agreement specifies the employee can revoke the
agreement at anytime. (See, e.g., Lubin v. The Wackenhut Corp. (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th
926, 942–943 (Lubin) [discussing the “nature of the work exception”].) The second
exception, set forth in Wage Order No. 5, subdivision (11)(D), applies to health care
workers who work longer than an eight-hour shift and allows these employees to “waive”
their “right to one of their two meal periods,” if they do so in writing and the employee
can revoke the waiver on one day’s notice. (See, e.g., Gerard v. Orange Coast Memorial
Medical Center (2018) 6 Cal.5th 443 (Gerard) [upholding waiver exception].) The third
exception, set forth in Wage Order No. 5, subdivision (11)(E), and the exception at issue
here, applies to employees of certain 24 hour residential care facilities, including for
seniors, and has a number of requirements as discussed in subsequent paragraphs. (See,
e.g., Palacio v. Jan & Gail’s Care Homes, Inc. (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1133, 1138–1141
(Palacio) [discussing 24 hour residential care facility exception].)

                                             1
employees did not have uninterrupted half hour meal periods, and employees were not
free to leave the premises during meal periods. The employer’s defense was not that any
exception to the general rule applied. Rather, the employer maintained employees could,
in fact, take 30-minute “off-duty” meal periods and the fact they did not avail themselves
of the opportunity could not, under Brinker, subject the employer to liability.
Accordingly, the employer focused its evidentiary presentation on trying to undermine
the testimony of the two employees who had been called as DLSE witnesses, by calling
three other employees who claimed they had ample time to eat and rest, and they could
have departed the premises had they desired or needed to do so. In other words, the
employer’s defense—that, in fact, employees could take uninterrupted 30-minute “off-
duty” meal periods—was wholly inconsistent with the invocation of any exception to the
general rule.
       It was not until a month after the hearing had concluded and the matter submitted
for decision, that the employer first raised the 24 hour residential care facility exception,
citing to Palacio (which had been decided more than nine months earlier). In a letter to
the hearing officer, the employer asked to “re-open[]” the “evidence.” After the
employer sent a second such letter, the DLSE opposed the request to reopen as being too
late and not warranted by the evidence. Given this chronology of events, the DLSE
agreed at oral argument the judgment could theoretically be affirmed on the ground of
forfeiture.
       Second, since this case was prosecuted and tried as a straightforward “Brinker”
case—i.e., that the employees were entitled to, but not provided with, uninterrupted, 30-
minute “off-duty” meal periods, during which they were free to leave the premises—and
was defended against as such, the employer made no affirmative showing that the 24
hour residential care facility exception applied. (See Lubin, supra, 5 Cal.App.5th at
p. 943 [“burden is on the employer to plead and prove facts justifying on-duty meal
periods”].) Nor did the hearing officer grant the employer’s belated request to reopen the
hearing to present additional evidence. As a consequence, the evidence does not


                                              2
conclusively establish that this exception even applies, let alone suffice for any
discussion about the particulars of a lawful “on-duty” meal period under this exception.
       The employer belatedly urged in the administrative proceedings, and has
maintained in these administrative mandamus proceedings, that the record establishes the
24 hour residential care facility exception applies because employees could, without
charge, eat the same food they prepared for residents and some employees did so.
However, this exception has additional substantive requirements, the first of which is that
“on-duty” meal periods are “necessary to meet regulatory or approved program
standards.” (Wage Order No. 5, subd. (11)(E).) This threshold requirement is directly at
odds, however, with the defense the employer presented—that employees could, in fact,
take uninterrupted, 30-minute “off-duty” meal periods. 2
       The 24 hour residential care facility exception further requires an employer to
establish that one of two additional conditions is met. (Wage Order No. 5, subd. (11)(E).)
The first condition an employer can choose to meet can, itself, be met in one of two
ways: (a) if the “employees [sic] eats with residents during residents’ meals and the
employer provides the same meal at no charge to the employee,” or (b) the employee “is
in sole charge of the resident(s)” and “on the day shift, the employer provides a meal at
no charge to the employee.” (Id., subd. (11)(E)(1)(a) & (b).) The second condition an
employer can choose to meet is providing employees, “except for the night shift,” the
“right to have an off-duty meal period” not more than once every two weeks “upon 30
days’ notice.” (Id., subd. (11)(E)(2).) Because the employer made no evidentiary
showing as to the applicability of this exception, it did not identify which of these two


       2
          Although the employer defended on the ground employees could, in fact, take
30-minute “off-duty” meal periods, it did not dispute that only one employee worked the
night shift at each of the two small homes (five to six residents) and that the senior
residents could not be left unattended—thus, alluding to regulatory controls. That was
not the case, however, as to employees on the day shift. At least two employees worked
that shift, and often the owner, herself, assisted in the care of residents. The employer
therefore maintained these employees could, if they wanted, take an uninterrupted, 30-
minute meal period and leave the premises.

                                              3
additional conditions it supposedly met. For example, there is no evidence employees
were required to eat with residents during residents’ meals, as required by subdivision
(11)(E)(1)(a). There is no evidence any employee on the night shift (the only shift where
an employee was in “sole charge” of the residents) understood that “on the day shift” that
employee would be provided a meal at no charge, as required by subdivision
(11)(E)(1)(b). And there is no evidence employees were aware they had the right to an
“off-duty” meal period, not more than once every two weeks, with 30 days notice. (Id.,
subd. (11)(E)(2).) Accordingly, as the DLSE also agreed at oral argument, given the
abysmal state of the evidence as to whether the 24 hour residential care facility exception
even applies, the judgment could theoretically also be affirmed on this ground. 3
       Third, the absence of a developed evidentiary record makes examination of the
nature of lawful “on-duty” meal periods under the 24 hour residential care facility
exception virtually impossible. We can point to Brinker as indicating “on-duty” meal
periods must, like “off-duty” meal periods, be 30 minutes in length. (Brinker, supra,
53 Cal.4th at p. 1035 [“An on-duty meal period is one in which an employee is not
‘relieved of all duty’ for the entire 30-minute period.”].) But this says next to nothing
about the nature of a lawful “on-duty” meal period under any exception to the general
rule and, particularly, the 24 hour residential care facility exception.
       By definition, an employee who “may be [lawfully] required to work on-duty meal
periods” (Wage Order No. 5, subd. (11)(E)) continues to have some duties during the
meal period and, thus, does not have either an uninterrupted meal period or the unfettered
right to leave the premises. Accordingly, in contrast to unpaid, uninterrupted 30-minute,
“off-duty” meal periods, during which employees are free to leave the premises—and


       3
          The hearing officer did not discuss the multiple requirements of the 24 hour
residential care facility exception or the evidence pertaining thereto. Rather, concluding
a paid “on-duty” meal period must, like an unpaid “off-duty” meal period, be 30 minutes
in length (without further discussion or elaboration), the hearing officer pointed to the
testimony of the two employees called by the DLSE that they had only 10 to 15 minutes
to eat before turning their full attention to other chores, and on the basis of that testimony
concluded the employer had not provided adequate meal periods.

                                              4
which are easily measured by “punching in and punching out”—the adequacy of lawful
“on-duty” meal periods is not easily evaluated. 4
       The very nature of the 24 hour residential care facility exception is illustrative.
This exception can apply, for example, as discussed above, where “the residential care
employees [sic] eats with residents during the residents’ meals and the employer provides
the same meal at no charge to the employee.” (Wage Order No. 5, subd. (11)(E)(1)(a).)
This envisions, then, communal dining of employee(s) and residents. Given the nature of
24 hour residential care for seniors, it is inevitable that during such communal meals
some residents will need assistance, which could range from pouring a glass of water, to
helping to cut food, to escorting a resident to and from the bathroom. If these sorts of
duties do not unduly impinge on the opportunity of employees to eat a nutritious meal
without being rushed over the course of a half hour, it certainly seems the employees will
have been afforded adequate lawful “on-duty” meal periods. On the other hand, if



       4
          The few DLSE opinion letters addressing “on-duty” meal periods also make
clear that, by definition, employees will continue to have some duties during such meal
periods and whether an “on-duty” meal period is adequate is a highly fact specific
inquiry. (E.g., Dept. Industrial Relations, DLSE Opn. Letter No. 1994.09.28 (Sept. 28,
1994) [“Examples of situations where the nature of the work would require an on-duty
lunch would be situations where the employee is the only person employed in the
establishment and closing the business would work an undue hardship on the employer;
or the continuous operation of machinery requiring monitoring is essential to the business
of the employer. In both of these cases, however, it would be necessary to establish that
the employee has adequate time to eat while on the job.”]; see The 2002 Update of the
DLSE Enforcement Policies and Interpretations Manual (Revised) (Apr. 2017), § 45.2.5
[describing “On-Duty Meal Period” as follows: “Even if all of the circumstances exist to
allow an on-duty meal period, the employee must be provided with the opportunity to eat
his or her meal while performing the duties required.”]; DLSE Memorandum dated Dec.
23, 1999, p. 8 [“Even though the employee is required to work during the on-duty meal
period, the employee must be given the opportunity, while working if necessary, to eat
his or her meal. That is what cannot be waived, if the work period exceeds six hours, and
if an on-duty meal period has been properly established.”].) In fact, the DLSE has not
identified, nor has our research disclosed, any regulatory advisement or other publication
actually stating lawful “on-duty” meal periods must be 30 minutes in length, let alone,
discussing how the adequacy of such meal periods should be assessed.

                                              5
employees feel pressured to eat meals as quickly as possible and to jump up as soon as
they swallow their final bite and turn their full attention to whatever work awaits them,
then it would seem the employees have not been afforded adequate “on-duty” meal
periods. (See Brinker, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 1040 [employer may not, by pressuring
employees, “undermine” formal policy of adequate breaks].) And what of an unexpected
event during communal dining—for example, a resident suffers a choking or medical
emergency requiring the immediate and undivided attention of one or more of the
employees? How such an event, which may occur only rarely, impacts the overall
adequacy of lawful “on-duty” meal periods in a 24 hour residential facility for seniors is a
challenging question. It is also one we cannot, and do not, answer here; rather, it is posed
to illustrate the complexity of, and extreme factual specificity of, what will constitute an
adequate 30-minute “on-duty” meal period in any particular context. 5
       Thus, while the DLSE urged us, at oral argument, to affirm on the ground paid
“on-duty” meal periods must be 30 minutes in length and in light of the evidence some
employees felt they had to rush through meal periods and return their full attention to


       5
           There are concomitant record keeping questions. For example, must employees
record minutes spent assisting senior residents, for example, in getting a cup of tea, or in
cutting their food? This would seem to be unduly burdensome and unreasonable. What
about time spent attending to a more unexpected event, like a choking? Again, the point
in raising these questions is to underscore that determining the adequacy of lawful half
hour “on-duty” meal periods and the sufficiency of records documenting such, is an
entirely different, and far more complex, inquiry than that in a case where the general
rule applies and employees are entitled to unpaid, uninterrupted 30-minute “off-duty”
meal periods during which they are free to leave the premises. It also bears noting that
the 24 hour residential care facility exception pertaining to meal periods set forth in Wage
Order No. 5, subdivision (11)(E) does not include the “start over” language that appears
in the rest period provisions that may, under certain circumstances, apply to such
facilities under Wage Order No. 5, subdivision (12)(C), and which states “[a]nother rest
period shall be authorized and permitted by the employer when an employee is
affirmatively required to interrupt his/her break to respond to the needs of residents.”
(See Lab. Code, § 887, subd. (c) [specifying emergency ambulance employees shall
remain on call during meal and rest periods, but if employee receives a communication
that requires a response, that meal or rest period “shall not be counted towards the meal
and rest periods the employee is entitled to” during his or her shift].)

                                              6
work as quickly as possible, it also acknowledged that what constitutes an adequate “on-
duty” meal period depends on the particular context and the specific facts, and that this
case is not one in which we can bring any further illumination to that complex question.

Gerald W. WILEY, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
MISSOURI PACIFIC RAILROAD COMPANY, Defendant-Appellant.
No. 82-229.
Court of Appeal of Louisiana, Third Circuit.
October 22, 1982.
Writ Denied January 10, 1983.
Dubuisson & Dubuisson, James G. Dubuisson, Opelousas, for defendant-appellant.
*1017 Carol J. Aymond, Bunkie, for plaintiffappellee.
Before DOMENGEAUX, DOUCET and YELVERTON, JJ.
DOUCET, Judge.
This is a retaliatory dischargeconflicts of lawcase involving an injured railway worker seeking to invoke state anti-discrimination laws.
Can a railroad employee, discharged for filing (and subsequently settling) a claim under the F.E.L.A., maintain a suit for wrongful discharge pursuant to Louisiana Revised Statute 23:1361. That is the issue presented for our consideration. As far as we are aware, this is the first reported case wherein application of the aforesaid wrongful discharge provision of our workmens compensation laws has been asserted.
The trial judge summarized the facts giving rise to this suit as follows:
"... on May 9, 1979, while in the course and scope of his employment by defendant, Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, plaintiff sustained an injury. As a result of these injuries plaintiff entered into a release with the railroad in consideration of the sum of $10,000.00 being paid to him by his employer. The plaintiff was required to sign a release which expressly stated the plaintiff had resigned from the services of the railroad and that he would not thereafter be employed by that company or any of its affiliated or subsidary companies. On November 20, 1980, the railroad sent a letter to plaintiff which read as follows:
"Our records indicate that you hold seniority on the Missouri Pacific Railroad.
Your services are needed at this time; therefore, you are requested to contact this office prior to December 1, 1980.
If for any reason you are unable to do so, please furnish medical evidence of your inability to do so. If you have not marked up in the allotted time, or given evidence to why you cannot you will be considered absent without proper authority and in violation of proper instructions."
At the instigation of defendant, plaintiff was re-employed by the railroad in December of 1980 and thereafter continued to work for the railroad until he was discharged by letter dated May 1, 1981 which read as follows:
"Please refer to your letter of March 13, 1980 wherein you relinquished all employment rights with Missouri Pacific Railroad, and agreed to release all claim for back wages, lost time, etc. This letter was signed as a final settlement growing out of a personal injury sustained by you at Luling, Louisiana on May 9, 1979.
We are advised that you were erroneously allowed to return to work.
This letter is to advise you that you cannot be permitted to work for Missouri Pacific Railroad again in any capacity, due to your final settlement dated March 13, 1980."
After trial on the merits, the trial court rendered judgment in favor of plaintiff, Gerald W. Wiley, awarding $21,421.40, representing one year's earnings plus attorney's fees in the sum of $3,500.00, pursuant to La.R.S. 23:1361. From that judgment defendant Missouri Pacific Railroad Company has appealed, specifying the following alleged errors:[1]

"1.
`The trial judge erred in holding that R.S. 23:1361 applied to a previous assertion of a claim under the Federal Employer's Liability Act.

2.
The trial judge erred in holding that plaintiff was discharged from his employment because of having asserted a previous claim under the Federal Employers' Liability Act.

3.
The trial judge erred in not holding that the provisions of R.S. 23:1361 are unconstitutional *1018 if applied to previous claims asserted under the Federal Employers' Liability Act on the ground that such provisions would constitute state legislation in a field of law pre-empted by laws passed by the Congress of the United States of America.

4.
The trial Judge erred in failing to hold that the provisions of R.S. 23:1361 would be unconstitutional if applied to previous assertion of claims under the Federal Employers' Liability Act on the ground that the Act would then be broader than its title."
The historical development of the employment relationship, leading up to the wrongful discharge action, was succinctly summarized in Pugh v. See's Candies, Inc., 116 Cal.App.3d 311,171 Cal.Rptr. 917 (1981), as follows:
"The law of the employment relationship has been, and perhaps still is, in the process of continuing evolution. The old law of master and servant, which held sway through the eighteenth century and to some extent beyond, viewed the relationship as primarily one of status rather than of contract. While agreement gave rise to the relationship and might establish certain of its terms, it was "custom and public policy, not the will of the parties, [which] defined the implicit framework of mutual rights and obligations." (Selznick, Law, Society and Industrial Justice (1969) p. 123.)
The essence of the relationship as so defined drew its contours from the model of the householdin which, typically, the servant worked, the master had general authority to discipline the servant, and it was the servant's duty to obey. (Id., at pp. 124-125.) At the same time, the master had certain responsibilities for the servant's general welfare. (Id., at p. 128.) The relationship was thus in a sense paternalistic. And it was not terminable at will; rather, there existed a presumption (in the absence of contrary agreement) that employment was for a period of one year. (Id., at p. 125.)
With the industrial revolution in the nineteenth century the law of master and servant underwent a gradual remodeling, primarily at the hands of the judiciary. Primary emphasis came to be placed, through contract doctrine, upon the freedom of the parties to define their own relationship. "The emphasis shifted from obligation to freedom of choice." (Id., at p. 131.) The terms of the contract were to be sought in voluntary agreement, express or implied, the employee being presumed to have assented to the rules and working conditions established by the employer. (Ibid.)
In light of the generally superior bargaining power of the employer, "the employment contract became [by the end of the nineteenth century] a very special sort of contractin large part a device for guaranteeing to management unilateral power to make rules and exercise discretion." (Ibid.) And management's unilateral power extended, generally, to the term of the relationship as well. The new emphasis brought with it a gradual weakening of the traditional presumption that a general hiring (i.e., one without a specific term) was for a year, and its replacement by the converse presumption that "a general or indefinite hiring is prima facie a hiring at will." (Wood, A Treatise on the Law of Master and Servant (1877) § 134, fn. 49.)3 In California, this presumption is reflected in Labor Code section 2922, which provides: "An employment, having no specified term, may be terminated at the will of either party on notice to the other. Employment for a specified term means an employment for a period greater than one month."
The recognized inequality in bargaining power between employer and individual employee undergirded the rise of the labor unions and the institutionalization of collective bargaining.4 And through collective bargaining, unions have placed limitations on the employer's unilateral right of termination. Under most union contracts, employees can only be dismissed for "just cause," and disputes over what constitutes cause for dismissal are *1019 typically decided by arbitrators chosen by the parties.5 Collective bargaining agreements, however, cover only a small fraction of the nation's work force,6 and employees who either do not or (as in the case of managerial employees such as Mr. Pugh) cannot form unions7 are left without that protection.
In recent years, there have been established by statute a variety of limitations upon the employer's power of dismissal. Employers are precluded, for example, from terminating employees for a variety of reasons, including union membership or activities, race, sex, age or political affiliation.8 Legislatures in this country have so far refrained, however, from adopting statutes, such as those which exist in most other industrialized countries,9 which would provide more generalized protection to employees against unjust dismissal. And while public employees may enjoy job security through civil service rules10 and due process,11 the legal principles which give rise to these protections are not directly applicable to employees in private industry.12" (Footnotes omitted).
Thus, under the traditional rule, an employer could discharge a long-term employee for no cause, bad cause, or any cause whatsoever, without regard to his years of satisfactory performance, or the substantial opportunities he may have foregone to remain in the employer's service. As a result thereof the employee without recourse often suffered the cost and inconvenience of searching for a new job (if available), moving expenses and the costs of relocating a family, and emotional distress from embarrassment and loss of status. Until recently the "at will" doctrine was considered so well established that courts applied the rule without inquiring into its logic.
Both legislatures and courts have limited the "employment at will" doctrine in recent years to protect participants in union activity[2], workmen's compensation claimants[3], employees serving on jury duty[4], veterans[5], debtors[6], and informants[7], and prohibit employment practices that discriminate because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin[8], or age[9].
Factors which courts have considered in finding rights to job security include special or separate consideration given by the employee for the position, the common law of the job, and the longevity of the employee in the job. In the first instance courts have looked at benefits to the employer, such as surrender of tort claims[10], contributions to the business such as bringing in a special account[11], and the extent of job training. The separate consideration necessary to sustain a permanent employment contract may also have arisen from special reliance by the employee or a demonstration that the employee forfeited something other than services in order to procure the jobe.g.the *1020 sale of a business where the offer of employment constituted an inducement for the change of status[12], relinquishing a good job or turning down another favorable opportunity in return for a promise of job stability[13], uprooting his or her family and moving long distances to accept a job[14], or hard-sell recruiting efforts[15]. Note, Implied Contract Rights to Job Security, 26 Stan.L.Rev. 335 (1974).
In other cases courts have looked to the "common law of the job", or established policy of the firm, to determine the parties understanding as to the duration of a job. The firm's policy may be ascertained from handbooks[16], memorandum to employees[17], oral statements, or the job itself may imply a necessary and natural duration[18]. Furthermore, longevity of service may give rise to implied job security inasmuch as pension and health care plans are a form of deferred compensation and the unexpected severance of an elderly employee both leaves the worker in a precarious position and unjustly enriches the employer[19]. Similarly, inclusion in the employment contract of a covenant not to compete may support a claim that the employee would not be dismissed except for good cause. Implied Contract Rights to Job Security, supra.
The United States Supreme Court has recognized implied contractual rights to job security as a property right within the meaning of the 14th Amendment. In Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972), a faculty member who had taught in a state college system for 10 years was dismissed without hearing. Although the college did not have a tenure system, the school's faculty guide stated that a teacher's job was secure as long as the teacher's services were satisfactory and he or she was cooperative. At the expiration of Sindermann's 10th one year contract, the Board of Regents of Odessa Junior College voted not to offer him another contract, provided no official statement, no hearing and no appeal. A press release alleged that plaintiff's nonretention was due to insubordination that arose while he was serving as President of the Texas Junior College Teachers Association. The Supreme Court held that the denial of an opportunity to prove an implied contractual right to employment security violated plaintiff's due process rights. Said the Court:
[A]bsence of such an explicit contractual provision [tenure] may not always foreclose the possibility that a teacher has a "property" interest in re-employment. For example, the law of contracts in most, if not all, jurisdictions has long employed a process by which agreements, though not formalized in writing, may be "implied."109
Another approach applied by courts to deter unjust dismissals is the implied contractual duty to perform in good faith. In Fortune v. National Cash Register Co., 373 Mass. 96,364 N.E.2d 1251 (1977), the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that implicit in the plaintiff's employment contract was a covenant of good faith which limited the employer's power to discharge. Accord: Pugh v. Seas Candies, supra. This court has heretofore recognized, in other contexts, that a contract terminable at will is nevertheless subject to limitation on the exercise of that will, to wit: that such termination not be arbitrary and capricious. *1021 Gautreau v. Southern Farm Casualty Insurance Co., 410 So.2d 815 (La.App. 3rd Cir. 1982) writ granted, La., 414 So.2d 392. In Monge v. Beebe Rubber Co., 114 N.H. 130, 316 A.2d 549 (1974), the New Hampshire Supreme Court imposed a good faith limitation on employer discharge on the grounds that an absolute right to discharge endangered the important public policy of improving labor relations in the state.

Louisiana protection from unjust discharge has as its origin La.Civ.Code Art. 2749 which provides:
Art. 2749. Liability for dismissal of laborer without cause
Art. 2749. If, without any serious ground of complaint, a man should send away a laborer whose services he has hired for a certain time, before that time has expired, he shall be bound to pay to such laborer the whole of the salaries which he would have been entitled to receive, had the full term of his services arrived.
However, the article's humane purpose of preventing abusive discharge has at times been thwarted by a narrow, limited construction of the term "hired for a certain time". Under jurisprudence of years past, permanent employment was often equated with employment at will. Thus, an injured worker who asserted his right to workmen's compensation and was discharged often found himself without recourse. In response to this abusive practice of employers, the Louisiana legislature in 1980, with the aid of organized labor, drafted a statute to protect injured workers who seek to avail themselves of our workmen's compensation laws. The enacted statute reads as follows:

SUBPART E. UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION PROHIBITED [NEW]
§ 1361. Unlawful discrimination prohibited
A. No person, firm or corporation shall refuse to employ any applicant for employment because of such applicant having asserted a claim for workmen's compensation benefits under the provisions of this Chapter or under the law of any state or of the United States. Nothing in this Section shall require a person to employ an applicant who does not meet the qualifications of the position sought.
B. No person shall discharge an employee from employment because of said employee having asserted a claim for benefits under the provisions of this Chapter or under the law of any state or of the United States. Nothing in this Chapter shall prohibit an employer from1 discharging an employee who because of injury can no longer perform the duties of his employment.
C. Any person who has been denied employment or discharged from employment in violation of the provisions of this Section shall be entitled to recover from the employer or prospective employer who has violated the provisions of this Section a civil penalty which shall be the equivalent of the amount the employee *1022 would have earned but for the discrimination based upon the starting salary of the position sought or the earnings of the employee at the time of the discharge, as the case may be, but not more than one year's earnings, together with a reasonable attorney's fee.
Added by Acts 1980, No. 704, § 1.
1 Changed from "form" to "from" on authority of R.S. 24:253.
(emphasis ours)
Hence, under Louisiana law, an employer must show good cause for discharging an employee engaged for a fixed term. Lanier v. Alenco, 459 F.2d 689 (5th Cir.C.A. 1972); LSA-C.C. Art. 2749. Assertion of a claim for workmen's compensation benefits is not good cause for discharge. LSA-R.S. 23:1361.
With regard to appellant's contention that the trial judge erred in finding that plaintiff was discharged for having asserted a claim against his employer, we note the following reasons assigned by the trial judge in his reasons for judgment:
"The railroad's letter of May 1, 1981 specifically advised the plaintiff that he could not be permitted to work for the railroad again in any capacity due to his final settlement dated March 13, 1980. The reason plaintiff was discharged was because of his assertion of a claim against the railroad."
We cannot say the trial judge's finding on this factual matter is clearly wrong; indeed, it appears to be the only conclusion supportable by the evidence. The only contrary evidence concerning the reasons for plaintiff's discharge is the ipse dixit statement of Mr. Robert L. Cathers, claims agent for the railroad, that plaintiff did not possess the character that defendant desired in its employees. We agree with the trial judge that plaintiff was dismissed for having asserted a claim against his employer. Accordingly, we proceed to address the issue of whether R.S. 23:1361 can be applied under the circumstances presented.
Railway employees are covered by the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 45 U.S. C.A. § 51 et seq., which extends to employees any part of whose duties further or substantially affect interstate commerce. As noted by Professors Malone and Johnson: "The expansive definition of the interstate commerce requirement of the FELA and the relative ease with which the requirement of negligence may be established under it have combined to make it virtually certain that an injured railway employee would not even seek benefits under a state compensation act." Malone & Johnson, Workers Compensation § 413 (1980 ed.). The relative ease with which recovery may be had is evidenced in Rogers v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Co., 352 U.S. 500, 77 S.Ct. 443, 1 L.Ed.2d 493 (1957), rehearing denied 353 U.S. 943, 77 S.Ct. 808, 71 L.Ed.2d 764, wherein it was held that the test of a jury case is whether proofs justify with reason conclusion that employer negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing injury, and it does not matter that, from the evidence, the injury was attributable to employee's contributory negligence, since the statute expressly imposes liability upon the employer to pay damages for injury due in whole or part to the employer's negligence. Thus, under the FELA the employer is stripped of his common law defenses and the injured worker's burden is eased. Inasmuch as the act is remedial in nature, it is afforded a liberal construction.
From the foregoing we discern that although entitled a liability act, the standard of proof required to sustain an action is such that the FELA is, at least in part, compensatory in nature. We find the FELA to be within the scope of laws designated in LSA-R.S. 23:1361.
Furthermore, we perceive no conflict between state and federal interests. The state interest expressed in R.S. 23:1361 remains the same whether plaintiff's claim be categorized as tort or workmen's compensationprotecting the assertion of legal right from retaliatory repercussion. On the other hand, no federal policy is interfered with by affording railroad employees the protection of R.S. 23:1361. Clearly, Louisiana is free to accord its workers greater protection from discrimination.
*1023 We find Andrews v. Louisville & Nashville Railroad Co., 406 U.S. 320, 92 S.Ct. 1562, 32 L.Ed.2d 95 (1972), relied upon by appellant, to be inapposite. Andrews held that where the only source of a railroad employee's right not to be discharged was a collective bargaining agreement between the railroad and union, the plaintiff-employee who had not pursued his administrative remedy under the Railway Labor Act could not bring an action against the railroad for wrongful discharge. The plaintiff herein asks for no relief under any collective agreement; rather, he seeks to invoke La.R.S. 23:1361. We have found no law evidencing an intention to render federal channels exclusive for retaliatory discharge claims.
The principal purpose of R.S. 23:1361 is remedial, rather than penal. Remedial and penal statutes are distinguishable in terms of the nature of the evil sought to be remedied by the legislation; it is penal if it undertakes to redress to the public and remedial if it undertakes to remedy a wrong to the individual. 3 Sutherland, Statutory Construction, § 60.03, at 33 (4th ed. Sands, 1974); State v. Boniface, 369 So.2d 115 (La.1979). R.S. 23:1361 was designed to protect individuals from discrimination by virtue of their assertion of legal right.
Inasmuch as R.S. 23:1361 is a remedial statute, it is to be liberally construed to suppress the evil and to advance the remedy. Starks v. Orleans Motors, Inc., 372 F.Supp. 928 (E.D.La.1974). What is a liberal construction is ordinarily one which makes the statutory rule or principle apply in more situations than would be the case under a strict construction. State v. Boniface, supra. In the present case the evil to be deterred is unjust dismissals. The employee must be able to exercise his right in an unfettered fashion without being subjected to reprisal. The remedy is intended to place the discriminated-against employee in the same position he would have been but for the employer's retaliatory conduct, thereby affording the worker an opportunity to organize his affairs and enter the work force anew. Extending the statute's remedy to workers discharged for asserting FELA claims is entirely consistent with liberal construction afforded remedial acts.
Next, appellant contends that R.S. 23:1361 entitled "Unlawful discrimination prohibited", is unconstitutional in that it violates Art. 3 Section 15(A) of the 1974 Louisiana Constitution which requires that "Every bill ... shall be confined to one object. Every bill shall contain a brief title indicative of the object." According to appellant, the body of the statute involved is broader than the title inasmuch as the title makes no reference to federal laws, therefore R.S. 23:1361 is invalid. However, it is only where the variance in the provisions of an act is palpable and totally irreconcilable with its title, or where both title and body express two distinct subjects, that the intention of the legislature will be held to be in conflict with the Constitution. Jefferson Parish v. Louisiana Dept. of Corrections, 259 La. 1063, 254 So.2d 582 (1971). The act at issue specifically prohibits discrimination against employees asserting a claim "under the provisions of this Chapter or under the law of any state or of the United States". The purpose of the constitutional provision that every statute have a title indicative of its object is not to require that the title of an act be an index of its contents, but only that the title in general direct attention to the purposes of the law. State v. Sliger, 261 La. 999, 261 So.2d 643 (1972). The title does not limit its application to claims for workmen's compensation benefits under state law; it does give fair notice as to its scope. We find R.S. 23:1361 constitutional.
Furthermore, the evidence indicates that plaintiff established a prima facie case under La.Civ.Code Art. 2749. The abovementioned letter received by plaintiff noted his seniority, requested his return to work and warned "If you have not marked upon in the allotted time, or given evidence as to why you cannot you will be considered without proper authority and in violation of proper instructions." Apparently, it was the understanding of the parties that the employment relationship would continue indefinitely *1024 pending the occurrence of some good and just cause for termination. Hence the term of employment was ascertainable. However, our resolution of plaintiff's R.S. 23:1361 claim renders it unnecessary for us to decide this issue.
For the reasons assigned, the judgment appealed is affirmed at appellant's cost.
AFFIRMED.
DOMENGEAUX, J., concurred in result only and assigned reasons.
DOMENGEAUX, Judge, concurring.
I concur in the result only. I agree that the circumstances of this case and the fact that plaintiff's claim was asserted and settled under the F.E.L.A. is such that his suit herein is lawfully asserted under the provisions of La.R.S. 23:1631.
I also agree that La.R.S. 23:1361 is not violative of Art. 3, Section 15(A) of the Louisiana Constitution of 1974.

WOLLMAN, Circuit Judge.


1
International Association of Entrepreneurs of America and associated entities (collectively "IAEA") appeals from the order dismissing its petition filed under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2201.  IAEA asserted exclusive federal jurisdiction to decide the merits of its ERISA claim.  The district court1 held that the matter could be resolved in a parallel state proceeding and dismissed the petition.  Although we essentially agree with the district court's treatment of the case, we conclude that the case should not have been dismissed, and we therefore vacate the dismissal and remand for entry of a stay.


2
* IAEA provides various insurance and benefits services to Missouri employers who are association members.  Defendant, Jay Angoff, Director of the Missouri Department of Insurance ("Angoff"), sought an injunction in Missouri state court to stop IAEA from selling insurance without a state license.  IAEA sought to remove the Missouri action to federal court, but the petition was denied as untimely.


3
IAEA then filed this declaratory action in federal court, alleging that IAEA's insurance activities were covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), codified as amended at 29 U.S.C. Secs. 1001-1461, and seeking a declaration that IAEA was exempt from state insurance regulation under ERISA provisions preempting such state rules.


4
The district court granted Angoff's motion to dismiss on the basis that IAEA's federal preemption claim was in substance nothing more than an affirmative defense to Angoff's state law claim and that the Declaratory Judgment Act was not intended to be a vehicle for such affirmative defenses.  Having dismissed on this ground, the district court declined to address Angoff's argument that IAEA does not operate an employee welfare benefit plan of the type covered by ERISA.  Likewise, the district court purported not to address Angoff's third ground for dismissal, that being Younger abstention.  See Middlesex County Ethics Committee v. Garden State Bar Ass'n, 457 U.S. 423, 102 S.Ct. 2515, 73 L.Ed.2d 116 (1982);  Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971).

* The keystone argument upon which IAEA's appeal depends is that ERISA contemplates that only federal courts decide matters of ERISA status.  Under IAEA's exclusive federal jurisdiction theory, since ERISA guarantees IAEA a right to petition only federal courts for injunctive relief against state attempts to regulate ERISA plans, this declaratory action must be allowed to proceed, as the issues it raises cannot be addressed in any other forum.


6
ERISA Sec. 502(a)(3), (29 U.S.C. Sec. 1132(a)(3)), establishes the right of an ERISA fiduciary to an injunction against practices violative of ERISA.  ERISA Sec. 502(e)(1), (29 U.S.C. Sec. 1132(e)(1)), provides that only a federal court can issue such an injunction.  For purposes of discussion we presume that under these provisions an ERISA fiduciary can indeed seek an injunction based on assertions of improper state regulation like those IAEA makes here.  E.g., MDPhysicians & Assoc. v. State Bd. of Ins., 957 F.2d 178 (5th Cir.)  (rejecting declaratory action on merits ground), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 179, 121 L.Ed.2d 125 (1992);  Atlantic Health Care Benefits Trust v. Foster, 809 F.Supp. 365, 368 (M.D.Pa.1992), aff'd mem., 6 F.3d 778 (3rd Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 689, 126 L.Ed.2d 656 (1994).  But IAEA's appeal fails because no court has yet decided whether IAEA is an ERISA plan as it alleges.


7
ERISA nowhere makes federal courts the exclusive forum for deciding the ERISA status vel non of a plan or fiduciary.  Unless instructed otherwise by Congress, state and federal courts have equal power to decide federal questions.  Federal Express Corp. v. Tenn.  Pub. Serv.  Comm'n, 925 F.2d 962, 968 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 812, 112 S.Ct. 59, 116 L.Ed.2d 35 (1991);  CSXT, Inc. v. Pitz, 883 F.2d 468, 472 (6th Cir.1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1030, 110 S.Ct. 1480, 108 L.Ed.2d 616 (1990).  Because ERISA is silent on the matter of the power to declare ERISA status, we conclude that the question of IAEA's ERISA status falls under the usual concurrent state and federal jurisdiction.


8
Until IAEA has proven its allegation that ERISA applies, questions of preemption and exclusive federal jurisdiction do not enter this case.  Until the preliminary issue of ERISA status is decided, IAEA may not seek the exclusive federal protections available to an ERISA plan.  See JAMES F. JORDEN, ET AL., HANDBOOK ON ERISA LITIGATION, ch. 1, Sec. 1.01, at 4 (1992) (hereafter ERISA LITIGATION) ("if no [ERISA] plan is involved, then ERISA's broad preemption of state law claims is not triggered.");   see also MDPhysicians, 957 F.2d at 182 (preemption issues need not be considered until ERISA status established).  (While we presume for discussion purposes that IAEA, if held to be covered by ERISA, could seek to enjoin the state court proceeding, this proposition is at least arguable.  See 1975 Salaried Retirement Plan, etc. v. Nobers, 968 F.2d 401, 408 (3rd Cir.1992) (refusing to enjoin state action deciding matters within exclusive federal jurisdiction), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1066, 122 L.Ed.2d 370 (1993);  Total Plan Servs. v. Texas Retailers Ass'n, 925 F.2d 142, 144-46 (5th Cir.1991) (same);  ERISA LITIGATION, ch. 1, Sec. 1.04[A], at 29 ("Despite this grant of exclusive jurisdiction, a federal court ordinarily may not enjoin a state court action seeking to adjudicate claims exclusively within federal court jurisdiction.").)


9
Our conclusion that concurrent jurisdiction exists at this preliminary stage of the litigation is buttressed by the fact that the courts of Missouri and other states have in the past decided questions of ERISA status without correction by the United States Supreme Court or Congress.  Marshall, et. al. v. Bankers Life and Cas. Co., 2 Cal. 4th 1045, 10 Cal.Rptr.2d 72, 832 P.2d 573, 575 (plan covered by ERISA), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 601, 121 L.Ed.2d 537 (1992);  Rizzi v. Blue Cross of S. Calif., 206 Cal.App.3d 380, 253 Cal.Rptr. 541, 542 (1988) (covered), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 821, 110 S.Ct. 78, 107 L.Ed.2d 44 (1989);  Cramer v. Ass'n Life Ins. Co., 569 So.2d 533, 534 (La.1990) (covered;  ERISA status litigated in lower courts but not appealed to state Supreme Court), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 938, 111 S.Ct. 1391, 113 L.Ed.2d 447 (1991);  Blue Cross Hosp. Servs., Inc. of Missouri, et al. v. Frappier, 681 S.W.2d 925, 931 (Mo.1984) (not covered), vacated, 472 U.S. 1014, 105 S.Ct. 3471, 87 L.Ed.2d 608, and readopted on remand, 698 S.W.2d 326 (Mo.1985);  Angoff v. Kenemore, et al., 887 S.W.2d 782, 786 (Mo.Ct.App.1994) (not covered).


10
Thus, what IAEA asserts to be an exclusive federal jurisdiction to decide ERISA status by declaration is actually an exclusive federal jurisdiction to grant certain types of declaratory and injunctive relief once ERISA status has been established by either a state or federal court.  Accordingly, the district court was correct in holding that IAEA's allegation that it is an ERISA fiduciary can be asserted as an affirmative defense in the ongoing state court action.

B

11
The question remains whether the district court had the discretion to defer consideration of this declaratory action.  While as a general proposition an alleged ERISA fiduciary can move for a federal declaration of its ERISA status, see MDPhysicians, 957 F.2d at 180;  Atlantic Health Care, 809 F.Supp. at 368, the usual discretionary limitations on declaratory actions apply unless Congress instructs differently.  See Franchise Tax Bd. of Calif. v. Constr.  Laborers Vacation Trust for S. Calif. et al., 463 U.S. 1, 18-19, 103 S.Ct. 2841, 2850-51, 77 L.Ed.2d 420 (1983);  BASF Corp. v. Symington, 50 F.3d 555, 557 (8th Cir.1995);  Omaha Property and Cas. Ins. Co. v. Johnson, 923 F.2d 446, 447-48 (6th Cir.1991);  Continental Airlines v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 819 F.2d 1519, 1524 (9th Cir.1987);  Transamerica Occidental Life Ins. Co. v. DiGregorio, 811 F.2d 1249, 1253 (9th Cir.1987).  A review of the procedural facts of this case together with precedent in analogous situations convinces us such limitations may properly be applied here.


12
It was only after it had been sued in state court and its removal petition had been denied as untimely that IAEA filed this declaratory action.  This sequence of events alerts us to be on guard for ties between the state and federal actions, because the Declaratory Judgment Act is not to be used either for tactical advantage by litigants or to open a new portal of entry to federal court for suits that are essentially defensive or reactive to state actions.  Moses H. Cone Mem.  Hosp. v. Mercury Constr.  Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 18 n. 20, 103 S.Ct. 927, 937, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983);  BASF, 50 F.3d at 558 (citing cases);  Continental Cas. Co. v. Robsac Indus., 947 F.2d 1367, 1372-73 (9th Cir.1991);  Omaha Property, 923 F.2d at 448;  Continental Airlines, 819 F.2d at 1524;  Transamerica, 811 F.2d at 1253;  Home Fed.  Sav. and Loan Ass'n v. Ins. Dept. of Iowa, 571 F.2d 423, 427 (8th Cir.1978).


13
More specifically, the Declaratory Judgment Act is not to be used to bring to the federal courts an affirmative defense which can be asserted in a pending state action.  Franchise Tax Bd., 463 U.S. at 16, 103 S.Ct. at 2849-50 (discussing Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 339 U.S. 667, 70 S.Ct. 876, 94 L.Ed. 1194 (1950));  BASF, 50 F.3d at 558.   In addition, the Declaratory Judgment Act is not meant to expand federal jurisdiction.  Franchise Tax Bd., 463 U.S. at 15-16, 103 S.Ct. at 2849-50;  Home Federal, 571 F.2d at 427 n. 17.   Here, IAEA passed up its chance to remove to federal court.  Limitations on removal may or may not be jurisdictional;  but either way, the limits must be strictly construed and enforced.  14A CHARLES A. WRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER & EDWARD H. COOPER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE, Sec. 3732 at 527 & n. 41 (1985 & Supp.1995) (hereafter WRIGHT & MILLER).  There is no need to allow state court defendants like IAEA to circumvent the removal statute's deadline by using the Declaratory Judgment Act as a convenient and temporally unlimited back door into federal court.  See Continental Airlines, 819 F.2d at 1524 (referring to special federal court discretion to prevent circumvention of removal statute).


14
A district court's decision on whether or not to proceed with a declaratory judgment action is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard.  Wilton v. Seven Falls Co., --- U.S. ----, ----, 115 S.Ct. 2137, 2143, 132 L.Ed.2d 214 (U.S.1995).  There was no abuse of discretion here.

C

15
Both parties appear to assume that the district court implicitly engaged in a Younger abstention analysis.  It is clear that the district court to some extent relied on the principles of comity and federalism in coming to its decision;  also, the district court indicated that its dismissal may have hinged on the existence of a parallel state proceeding.  Order at 8-9.


16
Although we need not address the abstention issue, our discussion above may have effectively resolved it.  The doctrine of abstention is premised on the idea that a federal court may defer to a state court confronted with a similar controversy:  there is no need for abstention unless the state and federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction of an issue or case.  See Dailey v. National Hockey League, 987 F.2d 172, 178 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 67, 126 L.Ed.2d 36 (1993);  Levy v. Lewis, 635 F.2d 960, 967 (2d Cir.1980).  For this reason, IAEA's argument against abstention presumes that the federal and state suits here are based on two separate causes of action, a presumption that we reject.


17
We note in closing that because concurrent jurisdiction exists in state and federal court to decide the question of IAEA's ERISA status, the district court should not have dismissed for lack of jurisdiction under FED.R.CIV.P. 12(b)(1).  While pre-answer motions are ostensibly enumerated in FED.R.CIV.P. 12(b), district courts have the discretion to recognize additional pre-answer motions, including motions to stay cases within federal jurisdiction when a parallel state action is pending.  Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co. of America, 316 U.S. 491, 494-96, 62 S.Ct. 1173, 1175-76, 86 L.Ed. 1620 (1942);  see generally 5A WRIGHT & MILLER, Sec. 1360 at 432, 438-41 (1990 & Supp.1995).  Here, while the state court action may finally resolve the case, it is also possible that further federal proceedings may prove necessary.  So long as a possibility of return to federal court remains, a stay rather than a dismissal is the preferred mode of abstention.  See Wilton, --- U.S. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2143 n. 2;  Bob's Home Service, Inc. v. Warren County, 755 F.2d 625, 628 (8th Cir.1985);  17A CHARLES A. WRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER & EDWARD H. COOPER, Sec. 4247 at 136-38 (1988).  Properly understood, Angoff's motion was for such a stay, not dismissal based on lack of jurisdiction.  Accordingly, we vacate the dismissal and remand for entry of a stay.

 The Honorable Scott O. Wright, Senior United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri



248 U.S. 90 (1918)
UNITED DRUG COMPANY
v.
THEODORE RECTANUS COMPANY.
No. 27.
Supreme Court of United States.
Argued March 12, 13, 1918.
Decided December 9, 1918.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT.
*91 Mr. Laurence A. Janney, with whom Mr. Alexis C. Angell and Mr. Frederick L. Emery were on the briefs, for petitioner.
Mr. Clayton B. Blakey for respondent.
*93 MR. JUSTICE PITNEY delivered the opinion of the court.
This was a suit in equity brought September 24, 1912, in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, by the present petitioner, a Massachusetts corporation, against the respondent, a Kentucky corporation, together with certain individual citizens of the latter State, to restrain infringement of trade-mark and unfair competition.
The District Court granted an injunction against the corporation defendant pursuant to the prayer of the bill. 206 Fed. Rep. 570. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decree and remanded the cause with directions to dismiss the bill. 226 Fed. Rep. 545. An appeal was allowed by one of the judges of that court, and afterwards we allowed a writ of certiorari. Pursuant to a stipulation, the transcript of the record filed for the purposes of the appeal was treated as a return to the writ. Under § 128, Judicial Code, as amended by Act of January 28, 1915, c. 22, § 2, 38 Stat. 803, the appeal must be dismissed, and the cause will be determined on the writ of certiorari.
*94 The essential facts are as follows: About the year 1877 Ellen M. Regis, a resident of Haverhill, Massachusetts, began to compound and distribute in a small way a preparation for medicinal use in cases of dyspepsia and some other ailments, to which she applied as a distinguishing name the word "Rex"  derived from her surname. The word was put upon the boxes and packages in which the medicine was placed upon the market, after the usual manner of a trade-mark. At first alone, and afterwards in partnership with her son under the firm name of "E.M. Regis & Company," she continued the business on a modest scale; in 1898 she recorded the word "Rex" as a trade-mark under the laws of Massachusetts (Acts 1895, p. 519, c. 462, § 1); in 1900 the firm procured its registration in the United States Patent Office under the Act of March 3, 1881, c. 138, 21 Stat. 502; in 1904 the Supreme Court of Massachusetts sustained their trade-mark right under the state law as against a concern that was selling medicinal preparations of the present petitioner under the designation of "Rexall remedies" (Regis v. Jaynes, 185 Massachusetts, 458); afterwards the firm established priority in the mark as against petitioner in a contested proceeding in the Patent Office; and subsequently, in the year 1911, petitioner purchased the business with the trade-mark right, and has carried it on in connection with its other business, which consists in the manufacture of medicinal preparations, and their distribution and sale through retail drug stores, known as "Rexall stores," situate in the different States of the Union, four of them being in Louisville, Kentucky.
Meanwhile, about the year 1883, Theodore Rectanus, a druggist in Louisville, familiarly known as "Rex," employed this word as a trade-mark for a medicinal preparation known as a "blood purifier." He continued this use to a considerable extent in Louisville and vicinity, spending money in advertising and building up a trade, so that  *95 except for whatever effect might flow from Mrs. Regis' prior adoption of the word in Massachusetts, of which he was entirely ignorant  he was entitled to use the word as his trade-mark. In the year 1906 he sold his business, including the right to the use of the word, to respondent; and the use of the mark by him and afterwards by respondent was continuous from about the year 1883 until the filing of the bill in the year 1912.
Petitioner's first use of the word "Rex" in connection with the sale of drugs in Louisville or vicinity was in April, 1912, when two shipments of "Rex Dyspepsia Tablets," aggregating 150 boxes and valued at $22.50, were sent to one of the "Rexall" stores in that city. Shortly after this the remedy was mentioned by name in local newspaper advertisements published by those stores. In the previous September, petitioner shipped a trifling amount  five boxes  to a drug store in Franklin, Kentucky, approximately 120 miles distant from Louisville. There is nothing to show that before this any customer in or near Kentucky had heard of the Regis remedy, with or without the description "Rex," or that this word ever possessed any meaning to the purchasing public in that State except as pointing to Rectanus and the Rectanus Company and their "blood purifier." That it did and does convey the latter meaning in Louisville and vicinity is proved without dispute. Months before petitioner's first shipment of its remedy to Kentucky, petitioner was distinctly notified (in June, 1911,) by one of its Louisville distributors that respondent was using the word "Rex" to designate its medicinal preparations, and that such use had been commenced by Mr. Rectanus as much as 16 or 17 years before that time.
There was nothing to sustain the allegation of unfair competition, aside from the question of trade-mark infringement. As to this, both courts found, in substance, that the use of the same mark upon different but somewhat *96 related preparations was carried on by the parties and their respective predecessors contemporaneously, but in widely separated localities, during the period in question  between 25 and 30 years  in perfect good faith, neither side having any knowledge or notice of what was being done by the other. The District Court held that because the adoption of the mark by Mrs. Regis antedated its adoption by Rectanus, petitioner's right to the exclusive use of the word in connection with medicinal preparations intended for dyspepsia and kindred diseases of the stomach and digestive organs must be sustained, but without accounting for profits or assessment of damages for unfair trade; citing McLean v. Fleming, 96 U.S. 245; Menendez v. Holt, 128 U.S. 514; Saxlehner v. Eisner & Mendelson Co., 179 U.S. 19, 39; Saxlehner v. Siegel-Cooper Co., 179 U.S. 42. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that in view of the fact that Rectanus had used the mark for a long period of years in entire ignorance of Mrs. Regis' remedy or of her trade-mark, had expended money in making his mark well known, and had established a considerable though local business under it in Louisville and vicinity, while on the other hand during the same long period Mrs. Regis had done nothing, either by sales agencies or by advertising, to make her medicine or its mark known outside of the New England States, saving sporadic sales in territory adjacent to those States, and had made no effort whatever to extend the trade to Kentucky, she and her successors were bound to know that, misled by their silence and inaction, others might act, as Rectanus and his successors did act, upon the assumption that the field was open, and therefore were estopped to ask for an injunction against the continued use of the mark in Louisville and vicinity by the Rectanus Company.
The entire argument for the petitioner is summed up in the contention that whenever the first user of a trade-mark has been reasonably diligent in extending the *97 territory of his trade, and as a result of such extension has in good faith come into competition with a later user of the same mark who in equal good faith has extended his trade locally before invasion of his field by the first user, so that finally it comes to pass that the rival traders are offering competitive merchandise in a common market under the same trade-mark, the later user should be enjoined at the suit of the prior adopter, even though the latter be the last to enter the competitive field and the former have already established a trade there. Its application to the case is based upon the hypothesis that the record shows that Mrs. Regis and her firm, during the entire period of limited and local trade in her medicine under the Rex mark, were making efforts to extend their trade so far as they were able to do with the means at their disposal. There is little in the record to support this hypothesis; but, waiving this, we will pass upon the principal contention.
The asserted doctrine is based upon the fundamental error of supposing that a trade-mark right is a right in gross or at large, like a statutory copyright or a patent for an invention, to either of which, in truth, it has little or no analogy. Canal Co. v. Clark, 13 Wall. 311, 322; McLean v. Fleming, 96 U.S. 245, 254. There is no such thing as property in a trade-mark except as a right appurtenant to an established business or trade in connection with which the mark is employed. The law of trade-marks is but a part of the broader law of unfair competition; the right to a particular mark grows out of its use, not its mere adoption; its function is simply to designate the goods as the product of a particular trader and to protect his good will against the sale of another's product as his; and it is not the subject of property except in connection with an existing business. Hanover Milling Co. v. Metcalf, 240 U.S. 403, 412-414.
The owner of a trade-mark may not, like the proprietor *98 of a patented invention, make a negative and merely prohibitive use of it as a monopoly. See United States v. Bell Telephone Co., 167 U.S. 224, 250; Bement v. National Harrow Co., 186 U.S. 70, 90; Paper Bag Patent Case, 210 U.S. 405, 424.
In truth, a trade-mark confers no monopoly whatever in a proper sense, but is merely a convenient means for facilitating the protection of one's good-will in trade by placing a distinguishing mark or symbol  a commercial signature  upon the merchandise or the package in which it is sold.
It results that the adoption of a trade-mark does not, at least in the absence of some valid legislation enacted for the purpose, project the right of protection in advance of the extension of the trade, or operate as a claim of territorial rights over areas into which it thereafter may be deemed desirable to extend the trade. And the expression, sometimes met with, that a trade-mark right is not limited in its enjoyment by territorial bounds, is true only in the sense that wherever the trade goes, attended by the use of the mark, the right of the trader to be protected against the sale by others of their wares in the place of his wares will be sustained.
Property in trade-marks and the right to their exclusive use rest upon the laws of the several States, and depend upon them for security and protection; the power of Congress to legislate on the subject being only such as arises from the authority to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States and with the Indian tribes. Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U.S. 82, 93.
Conceding everything that is claimed in behalf of the petitioner, the entire business conducted by Mrs. Regis and her firm prior to April, 1911, when petitioner acquired it, was confined to the New England States with inconsiderable sales in New York, New Jersey, Canada, and Nova Scotia. There was nothing in all of this to give her *99 any rights in Kentucky, where the principles of the common law obtain. Hunt v. Warnicke's Heirs, 3 Kentucky (Hardin), 61, 62; Lathrop v. Commercial Bank, 8 Dana (Ky.), 114, 121; Ray v. Sweeney, 14 Bush (Ky.), 1, 9; Aetna Ins. Co. v. Commonwealth, 106 Kentucky, 864, 881; Nider v. Commonwealth, 140 Kentucky, 684, 687. We are referred to no decision by the courts of that State, and have found none, that lays down any peculiar doctrine upon the subject of trade-mark law. There is some meager legislation, but none that affects this case (Kentucky Stats., § 2572c, subsec. 7; §§ 4749-4755). There was nothing to prevent the State of Kentucky (saving, of course, what Congress might do within the range of its authority) from conferring affirmative rights upon Rectanus, exclusive in that Commonwealth as against others whose use of the trade-mark there began at a later time than his; but whether he had such rights, or respondent now has them, is a question not presented by the record; there being no prayer for an injunction to restrain petitioner from using the mark in the competitive field.
It is not contended, nor is there ground for the contention, that registration of the Regis trade-mark under either the Massachusetts statute or the act of Congress, or both, had the effect of enlarging the rights of Mrs. Regis or of petitioner beyond what they would be under common-law principles. Manifestly, the Massachusetts statute (Acts 1895, p. 519, c. 462) could have no extraterritorial effect. And the Act of Congress of March 3, 1881, c. 138, 21 Stat. 502, applied only to commerce with foreign nations or the Indian tribes, with either of which this case has nothing to do. See Ryder v. Holt, 128 U.S. 525. Nor is there any provision making registration equivalent to notice of rights claimed thereunder. The Act of February 20, 1905, c. 592, 33 Stat. 724, which took the place of the 1881 Act, while extending protection to trade-marks used in interstate commerce, does not enlarge *100 the effect of previous registrations, unless renewed under the provisions of its twelfth section, which has not been done in this case; hence we need not consider whether anything in this act would aid the petitioner's case.
Undoubtedly, the general rule is that, as between conflicting claimants to the right to use the same mark, priority of appropriation determines the question. See Canal Co. v. Clark, 13 Wall. 311, 323; McLean v. Fleming, 96 U.S. 245, 251; Manufacturing Co. v. Trainer, 101 U.S. 51, 53; Columbia Mill Co. v. Alcorn, 150 U.S. 460, 463. But the reason is that purchasers have come to understand the mark as indicating the origin of the wares, so that its use by a second producer amounts to an attempt to sell his goods as those of his competitor. The reason for the rule does not extend to a case where the same trade-mark happens to be employed simultaneously by two manufacturers in different markets separate and remote from each other, so that the mark means one thing in one market, an entirely different thing in another. It would be a perversion of the rule of priority to give it such an application in our broadly extended country that an innocent party who had in good faith employed a trade-mark in one State, and by the use of it had built up a trade there, being the first appropriator in that jurisdiction, might afterwards be prevented from using it, with consequent injury to his trade and good-will, at the instance of one who theretofore had employed the same mark but only in other and remote jurisdictions, upon the ground that its first employment happened to antedate that of the first-mentioned trader.
In several cases federal courts have held that a prior use of a trade-mark in a foreign country did not entitle its owner to claim exclusive trade-mark rights in the United States as against one who in good faith had adopted a like trade-mark here prior to the entry of the foreigner into this market. Richter v. Anchor Remedy Co., 52 Fed. *101 Rep. 455, 458; Richter v. Reynolds, 59 Fed. Rep. 577, 579; Walter Baker & Co. v. Delapenha, 160 Fed. Rep. 746, 748; Gorham Mfg. Co. v. Weintraub, 196 Fed. Rep. 957, 961.
The same point was involved in Hanover Milling Co. v. Metcalf, 240 U.S. 403, 415, where we said: "In the ordinary case of parties competing under the same mark in the same market, it is correct to say that prior appropriation settles the question. But where two parties independently are employing the same mark upon goods of the same class, but in separate markets wholly remote the one from the other, the question of prior appropriation is legally insignificant, unless at least it appear that the second adopter has selected the mark with some design inimical to the interests of the first user, such as to take the benefit of the reputation of his goods, to forestall the extension of his trade, or the like."
In this case, as already remarked, there is no suggestion of a sinister purpose on the part of Rectanus or the Rectanus Company; hence the passage quoted correctly defines the status of the parties prior to the time when they came into competition in the Kentucky market. And it results, as a necessary inference from what we have said, that petitioner, being the newcomer in that market, must enter it subject to whatever rights had previously been acquired there in good faith by the Rectanus Company and its predecessor. To hold otherwise  to require Rectanus to retire from the field upon the entry of Mrs. Regis' successor  would be to establish the right of the latter as a right in gross, and to extend it to territory wholly remote from the furthest reach of the trade to which it was annexed, with the effect not merely of depriving Rectanus of the benefit of the good-will resulting from his long-continued use of the mark in Louisville and vicinity, and his substantial expenditures in building up his trade, but of enabling petitioner to reap substantial benefit from the publicity that Rectanus *102 has thus given to the mark in that locality, and of confusing if not misleading the public as to the origin of goods thereafter sold in Louisville under the Rex mark, for, in that market, until petitioner entered it, "Rex" meant the Rectanus product, not that of Regis.
In support of its contention petitioner cites the same cases that were relied upon by the District Court, namely, McLean v. Fleming, 96 U.S. 245; Menendez v. Holt, 128 U.S. 514; Saxlehner v. Eisner & Mendelson Co., 179 U.S. 19, 39; and Saxlehner v. Siegel-Cooper Co., 179 U.S. 42. They exemplify the rule that, where the proof of infringement is clear, a court of equity will not ordinarily refuse an injunction for the future protection of the proprietor of a trade-mark right, even where his acquiescence and laches have been such as to disentitle him to an accounting for the past profits of the infringer. The rule finds appropriate application in cases of conscious infringement or fraudulent imitation, as is apparent from a reading of the opinions in those cases; but it has no pertinency to such a state of facts as we are now dealing with. In McLean v. Fleming, the only question raised in this court that affected the right of the appellee to an injunction was whether the Circuit Court had erred in finding that defendant's labels "Dr. McLean's Universal Pills," etc., infringed complainant's label "Dr. C. McLane's Celebrated Liver Pills," and this turned upon whether the similarity was sufficient to deceive ordinarily careful purchasers. The evidence showed without dispute that from the beginning of his use of the offending labels the defendant (McLean) had known of the McLane liver pills, and raised at least a serious question whether he did not adopt his labels for the purpose of palming off his goods as those of complainant. What he controverted was that his labels amounted to an infringement of complainant's, and when this was decided against him the propriety of the injunction was clear. In Menendez v. *103 Holt, likewise, defendants (Menendez) admitted the existence of the brand in question  the words "La Favorita" as applied to flour  and admitted using it, but denied that Holt & Company were the owners, alleging that one Rider was a former member of that firm and entitled to use the brand, and that under him defendants had sold their flour branded "La Favorita, S.O. Rider." There was, however, no question but that defendants adopted the brand knowing it to be already in use by others. In the Saxlehner Cases, the facts were peculiar, and need not be rehearsed; injunctions were allowed to restrain the sale of certain waters in bottles and under labels in which those of complainant were intentionally imitated. In all four cases the distinguishing features of the present case were absent.
Here the essential facts are so closely parallel to those that furnished the basis of decision in the Allen & Wheeler Case, reported sub nom. Hanover Milling Co. v. Metcalf, 240 U.S. 403, 419-420, as to render further discussion unnecessary. Mrs. Regis and her firm, having during a long period of years confined their use of the "Rex" mark to a limited territory wholly remote from that in controversy, must be held to have taken the risk that some innocent party might in the meantime hit upon the same mark, apply it to goods of similar character, and expend money and effort in building up a trade under it; and since it appears that Rectanus in good faith, and without notice of any prior use by others, selected and used the "Rex" mark, and by the expenditure of money and effort succeeded in building up a local but valuable trade under it in Louisville and vicinity before petitioner entered that field, so that "Rex" had come to be recognized there as the "trade signature" of Rectanus and of respondent as his successor, petitioner is estopped to set up their continued use of the mark in that territory as an infringement of the Regis trade-mark. Whatever confusion may have *104 arisen from conflicting use of the mark is attributable to petitioner's entry into the field with notice of the situation; and petitioner cannot complain of this. As already stated, respondent is not complaining of it.
Decree affirmed.

        Samer Shehadeh, a citizen of Jordan, married an American citizen and then moved to
the United States as a conditional permanent resident. See 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(a)(1); 8 C.F.R.
§ 216.1. Less than a year after he arrived, an Illinois court convicted him of misdemeanor
domestic battery against his then‐spouse, see 720 ILCS 5/12‐3.2(a)(1). An immigration judge
ordered him removed after determining that this conviction qualified as a “crime of
domestic violence,” see 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(E)(i), meaning “any crime of violence” as


       *
        After examining the briefs and record, we have concluded that oral argument is
unnecessary. Thus, the petition for review is submitted on the briefs and record. See FED. R.
APP. P. 34(a)(2)(C).

defined in 18 U.S.C. § 16(a) that is committed against a person with whom the perpetrator
has a domestic relationship. The Board of Immigration Appeals agreed and dismissed
Shehadeh’s administrative appeal, relying on our decision in LaGuerre v. Mukasey, 526 F.3d
1037 (7th Cir. 2008). In LaGuerre, we held that a conviction under the same statutory
provision for domestic battery in Illinois qualified as a crime of violence. See id. at 1039.
Shehadeh now petitions for review of the Board’s decision; we deny his petition.

        In his sole argument on appeal, Shehadeh invites us to revisit LaGuerre. He contends
that our earlier decision in Flores v. Ashcroft, 350 F.3d 666 (7th Cir. 2003), requires us first to
examine the minimum amount of force required under the statute before the conviction
may be qualified as a crime of violence. He insists that we skipped this step in LaGuerre.
 
        Shehadeh misunderstands our holding in Flores. In Flores we examined whether a
“crime of domestic violence” under § 1227(a)(2)(E)(i) included a conviction for
misdemeanor battery in Indiana. As we noted in Flores, and as the Supreme Court later
directed in Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. 1, 7 (2004), we assess whether an offense is a crime of
violence by focusing on the elements of the crime, see LaGuerre, 526 F.3d at 1039; Szucz‐Toldy
v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 978, 981 (7th Cir. 2005); Flores, 350 F.3d at 671, and ascertain whether
the crime requires as an element the use of physical force, meaning “force . . . that is
intended to cause bodily injury.” Flores, 350 F.3d at 672; see also Johnson v. United States, 130
S. Ct. 1265, 1271 (2010). At the time he was convicted, the relevant portion of the domestic
battery statute in Illinois prohibited “intentionally or knowingly . . . [c]aus[ing] bodily harm
to any family or household member.” 720 ILCS 5/12‐3.2(a)(1) (2002). Because Shehadeh’s
domestic battery conviction requires the use of physical force, it qualifies as a crime of
violence under 18 U.S.C. § 16(a). See LaGuerre, 526 F.3d at 1039 (citing United States v. Upton,
512 F.3d 394, 405 (7th Cir. 2008)). Although Shehadeh criticizes LaGuerre for not considering
the quantum of force needed to violate the statute, we do not look beyond the elements of
the crime unless it is divisible, meaning that the statute creates multiple crimes or specifies a
variety of ways to commit a single offense, some of which contain the elements of a crime of
violence, and some that do not. See Szucz‐Toldy, 400 F.3d at 981; Flores, 350 F.3d at 670; see
also United States v. Woods, 576 F.3d 400, 411 (7th Cir. 2009). The portion of the domestic
battery statute in Illinois at issue is not divisible. 

                                                                                           DENIED.

Before KING, HAYNES, and GRAVES, Circuit Judges.
PER CURIAM:*
        The attorney appointed to represent Rafael Castro-Olivares has moved for
leave to withdraw and has filed a brief in accordance with Anders v. California,
386 U.S. 738 (1967), and United States v. Flores, 632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir. 2011).
Castro-Olivares has filed a response. The record is insufficiently developed to
allow consideration at this time of Castro-Olivares’s claim of ineffective
assistance of counsel; such a claim generally “cannot be resolved on direct appeal
when the claim has not been raised before the district court since no opportunity

         Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not
be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR.

existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations.” United States v.
Cantwell, 470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks and
citation omitted). We have reviewed counsel’s brief and the relevant portions of
the record reflected therein, as well as Castro-Olivares’s response. We concur
with counsel’s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for
appellate review. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED,
counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS
DISMISSED. See 5TH CIR. R. 42.2.

                     STATEMENT REGARDING ORAL   ARGUMENT


EETITIONER URGES THE COURT TO ALLOW ORAL ARGUMENT FOR THE        FOLLOWING

REASONS;   TO WIT:

petitioner's claim of double jeopardy is based on the Gavazos casg
203 S.W-3d 333 (Tex.Grim-App.2006) and the Castillo case that the
State cited in its brief: Ex parte Castillo/ 432 S.W.3d 433 (Tex.App.
-San Antonio 2014/no pet-h-).
Furthermore/ this error is an error whether objected to or not.
Petitioner briefed said error in his Pro/se brief which the 13th
Court of Appeals failed to adjudicate oniits merits.
Because their is a misjoinder issue in multiple count indictment
Petitioner needs futher redress      from the Court of Appeals to address
said grounds. Also because the, record was fully developed before the
Court Petitioner claimed ineffective assistance of counsels on both
direct appeal as well as trial attorneys. Fetitoner should be given
the full adjudication of ineffective assistance of counsel as outlined
in Trevino v. Thaler/569 U.S.       (2013). Furthermore/ Petitioner urges
the Court for oral argument that Petitioner's attorney on direct appeal
filed Anders brief and motion to withdraw/        the Court assigned Stephen
W. Byrne as attorney who filed motion to withdraw based on ill-health
and no Ander's brief. Because he was the attorney of record the 13th
Court of appeals was in error and abused their discretion by ruling
on Anders brief filed by attorney Fred Jiminez whom was no longer
Petitoner's attorney of record and such Anders brief filed was moot
by operation of law. Because the remainder of the errors are based on
ineffective assistance of counsel Petitioner urges the Court to allow
oral argument.

                        STATEMENT    OF   THE   CASE



on December 12/ 2011 Jose Gonzales III, hereinstyled Petitioner was

charged with Capital Murder in the course of. committting a Burglary

offense of Aggravated Assault with a Deadly Weapon.

Alice/ Texas on the:: day of the offense-         In a high profile trial

Petitioner was convicted on both counts by a biased and highly ^

prejudiced jury-

The court sentenced Petitioner to life with out parole on count 1/

and life with parole on count II. Wherein said convictions are constu-

tionally infirm- The trial was overwhelmed by the media, and public

pressure. Change of venue was warranted.




                                    VI-
              STATEMENT REGARDING PROCEDURAL HISTORY

Petitoner was charged by indictment with one count of :Capital
murder during the course of committing a burglary of a habitation,
and one count of burglary of a habitation with the intent to commit
aggravated assault or a   felony.    A, jury convicted him of both offenses
as alleged in the indictment on December 6/      2012. The Court assessed
punishment at life without the possibility of parole for the Capital
Murder charge and life in the Institutional Division of the Texas
department of Criminal Justice-CID for the Burglary of a habitation
charge- The Petitioner filed notice of appeal on December 10, 2012.
Petitioner's attorney of record Fred Jiminez filed an Anders brief
on July 18, 2013. On July 24,    2013 Attorney Fred Jiminez filed a motion
to withdraw as attorney. On August 16, 2013 the trial court appointed
Stephen W. Byrne to represent Petitoner. On September 8^ 2013 Stephen
W. Byrne filed motion to withdraw citing ill-health and requested the
court to appoint new counsel. No Anders brief was filed and no new
attorney was appointed. Petitioner filed a motion in the 13th Court of
Appeals for trial record. Petitioner filed his Pro/se brief on May 23,
2014, along with request for oral argument. Furthermore, Petitioner
filed a motion in the 13th Court of appeals for his trial attorney to
produce the psychological report generated from his court ordered
evaluation. Such report was never, made part of the record- The State
was ordered to file   their brief.   The case was   due for   submission on
August 13, 2014. The State filed their brief on August 12,         2014 with a
motion for an extension of time.     Petitioner filed a   motion to hold said
appeal in abeyance in order to respond to State's brief. On August 14,
2014 the Court affirmed in an unpublished unsigned boilerplate opinion
by Justice Dori Contreras Garza,     which appear to be the work of a     clerk
or para-legal employed by said justice refering soley to the Anders brief
that attorney Fred Jiminez     submitted that should have been ruled moot.
Petitioner filed motion for rehearing on August 30, 2014. The State filed
brief agreeing with Petitioner's claim of double jeopardy wherein the
San Antonio Court rendered relief for the exact same issue- Rehearing
was denied on January 21,    2015-

GROUND   ONE:

TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ALLOWING PETITONER TO BE TRIED I=N SHACKLES IN
VIOLATION OF U.S.C-A. CONST. AMENDS 6TH & 14TH. TRIAL COURT INFRINGED
UPON PETITIONER'S PERSUMPTION OF INNOCENCE/ AND HIS RIGHT TO COUNSEL.
INEFFECTIVE aSSlSTAHGE OF COHNSBIL FOR OBJECTING TO PETITIONER BEING
SHACKLED AND THEREBY PROGEDURALLY DEFAULTING PETITtlONESFSSCCAIHa-
Petitioner contends the trial court abused its discretion in requi
ring Petitioner to wear shackles during trial/ and the wearing of
shackles was not harmless.    (RR.Vol.3/ Pg.l26/Line 3-13). From this
colloquy between the court and the Petitioner ^estEaihtsr.as articulated
by the court line 8, does not justify shackling of the Petitioner. The
Court of Criminal' Appeals has repeatedly critized       Nueces County Courts
for rountinely shackling defendants without articulating a need for
restraints.     Criminal Law Keynote-637-2: Grounds and circumstances
affecting the use of restraints in general. Essential State interest
justifying shackling a defendant is found where there is a danger of
escape or injury to the jury/ counsel/ or other trial participants.
U.S. V- Banegas/ 600 F.3d 342. Criminal Law Keynote-637.2: Rountine
shackling oi'defendants is prohibited. Bell v. Stated 356bS.W.3d 528/
rehearing overruled. (Tex-App.Houston[14th Dist.]2008).Generally a defen
dant has right to be tried without being shackled/ whether or not the
shackles are visible - to the jury? however/the trial r<s&U-r:t has discretion
to order restriants if there is a ^showing of a manifest need or execep-
tional circumstances/    such as-when a    defendant poses a   threat to himself
or others, yglesias v. State/ 252 S.W.Sd 733/ PDR rev. refd (Tex.App.
Houstonv[14th Dist.] 2007). Requiring a defendant to be tried in shackles
without adequate reasons is repugnant to iire spirit of r.the law and ideas
of justice whether those restriants visiblecor unseen-Grayson v.viState/
19225.W. 3d 790/ also see/ Mendoza v. State/ 1 S.W.3d 829 (Tex.App.-Corpus
Christi 1999)(Reversed Aug.31/1999). The Court of Criminal Appeals admoni

 ^ants were visible to the jurors.. See Vol ^3 .pg. 126. The Petitioner was
 denied the persuiaptibn of innocence and every aspect of due process under
 the U.S. Const.14th Amend/   6th Amends/ Equal Protection Clause.
 Ineffective Assistance of Gounseli To Wit:    Because Petitioner's counsel
 did not object to petitioner being shackled/ said counsel procedurally
 defaulted said claim for purpose of appellate review and such deficient
 performance prejudiced the out come and because of this act and ommission
 there is a probability that the outcome would have been different.
 Shackling of•Petitioner   without a demonstrative need compromised the
 formal dignity of the court and judicial proceedings and lead to harmful
 collateral effects- Such eff'ects cheifly included curtailing Petitioner's
 ability to communicate: freely v/with counsel because of the physical limi
 tations imposed by shackles and simply the distraction and embarrasment
 they caused the Petitioner. See/ United State/ v. Durham/ 287 F-3d 1297/
 1304 <llth Gir.2002)   ("Even if the [shackles] placed on the defendant are
 visible to the jury/ they still - may... confuse the defendant/ impair his
. ability to confer with counsel/ and significantly affected the trial
 strategy he choose to follow.") . Petitioner's attorney made the follow
 ing statement to the prospective jurors that tainted the whole trial
 process: I frankly/ rprobably will not be spending any'tiffie'-qiaeStioning
 that type of evidence because as I told you right from the get go/ Jose
 is in fact guilty of criminal homicide/ the question is what sort of
 criminal hombcide is he in fact guilty of? See/ (Vol.3/pg.147/4-9).
 Because Petitioner was shackled he did not approve of such trial strategy/
 whie^imade the trial process unfair and confused Petitioner/ and impaired ,
 his ability to communicate/ and significantly effected the trial strategy/
 wherein Petitioner was not informed of such trial strategy. Petitioner
 believed that temporary insanity would be the trial strategy and course
 his attorney would take. It appears that attorney's error for not object
 ing to shackling/ along with the attorney's anprofessional error that
 believing that Petitioner was guilty and shackling implied dangerousness
 in the jurries mind/ serverly infringed on Petitioners persumption of
 innocence/ was defificent performance that reasonable effected the out
 come ofcthe case. Petitioner was made to stand for the jury on numerous
 occassions/ not only were the shackles visible/ but because of the
 movement/ the chains were heard byithe jurors. In such a high profile
 trial/ here the errors originated from the trial court's saa sponte order/
 and trial court's reason for shackling the Petitioner are insufficient as
 a matter of law. See/ Garcia v. State/ 919 S.W.2d 370,381 (Tex.Crim.App.-
 1994). Because of errors appearing in the record PDR should be granted.

THE STATE COMMITTED DOUBLE JEOPARDY WHEN IT PROSECUTED PETITIONER
FORMMUETIEEE BURGLARIOUS ENTRIES WHERE THERE WASOONEY (1) UNLAWFUL
ENTRY. IN VIOLATION OF TEXAS CONST. ARTICE 1§14 AND U.S.C-A- CONST-
AMEND. 5th AND V.T.C.C.P. ARTICLE 1.10. TO WIT:
Petitioner was convicted in a single trial and given multiple punishments
for the same conduct/ thereby invoking the jeopardy clause in the P»S.
Const. & the Texas Const. Petitioner was charged by indictment in Count I
with coniitting Murder in the course of a Burglary of a Habitation, and in
Count II/ Burglary of a Habitation with Intent to Commit Aggravated
Assault or a Felony- In Art- 1.10 V.T.C.C.P. States: No person for the
same offense shall twice be put inr jeopardyief life-be it-b©rtyf snor shall
a person be again put upon for trial for the same offense; after a verdict
of not guilty in court of competent jurisdiction. The rule is a State may
notpplace a defendant in doiable jeopardy; U.S. Const. V; Tex. Const. Art.
I§14; Benton v. Maryland/ 395 U.S. 781 (1969). This means the State may
not:. :.(1) prosecute a. defendant fGrvthd same offense after an acquittal;
and (2) prosecute a defendant for the same offense after a conviction; or
(3) obtain multiple punishments in a single trial for the same offense-
Illinios v. Vitale/ 477 U.S. 410 (1980); Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S- 161 (197?
7). What we are concerned here is; "that Count I for Capital Murder is
predicated on a burglarious entry in order to be upgraded to Capital
Mureder- See, Tex. Penal Code § 19.03. Count 11, under Penal Code § 30.02
Burglary of a Habitation intent to Commit Aggravated Assault or a Felony-
The "same elements" test found in Blockburger v. U.S., 284 U.S. 299 (19-
32) questions whether the State is attempting to punish the defendant
twice for the same offense- This test asks the Court to examine each of
the statutes to determine whether each require a proof of:apdifferent
element the other does not- The Court abandoned the "Same ebsdaet" test
by overrulling Grady v. Corbin, 495 U.S. 508 (1990), in U.S. v. Dixon,
509 U.S. 688 (1993) . But in double jeopardy/mCiitiple punishment claims,
Blockburger is not the solo focus- Ervin v. State$?991 S.W.2d 804,814
(Tex.Ceim.App.1999)- .IfIthe Court has actual legislative intent of the
two statutes, that intent is the critical factor- If not then look at
Girdy V. State/ 213 S.W.3d 315/319 (Tex.Crim.App.2006)(if the prosecution,
in proving one element of one offense, also necessarily proves another
charged offense; if so, there must be clear legislative intent to punish
the offense seperately or multiple punishments are barred.)

The issue before us is convicting Petitioner of two burglarious entries
each with a different complainant but arising from a single unlawful en
try of a habitation constitute double jeopardy? The prosecutions theory
in the charging instrument that Petitioner committed Capital Murder in
the course of committing Burglary of a Habitation in Count:!. The pre
requisite of felony murder upgraded to capital ..murder is outlined in V.T.-
G-A. Penal Code § 19.03 (a)(2). Wherefore without the burglarious entry
                            '"I
Petitioner could only be convicted murder as defined. The integral part
of the conviction in Count I is the burglary of a habitation- It was
established at trial/ that Petitoner kicked in the front door/ shot/at::
Vidal Rodriguez/ then proceeded to the back bedroom and shot his estranged
wife-multiple times. See, (RR.Vol.4/pg.11-17. The theory of the indictment
differed from the theory at trial. Wherein the capital murder was placed
in a stratigic position of appearing first/ when in fact it was the-'
result of Count II/ Burglary of a Habitation intent to commit a Felony
(Aggravated Assault). Burglary of a Habitation is complete once the
unlawful entry is made, without regard tb whether the intended theft or
felony is also completed. V.T.C-A. Penal Code § 30.02 (a)$2)/ V.T.C.A.

GROUND TWO CONT:


§ 22.02 Aggravated Assault (1) Causes serious bodily injury to another,
including the person's spouse; or (2) Uses or exhibits a deadly weapon
during the commission of the assault and causes serious bodily injury
to a person whose relationship to or association with the defendant is
described by by Sections 71.003/ 71.0021 (b)/ 71.005 (b), an offense
under this statute is a felony of the second degreeif; (to end of statute)-
The allowable unit of prosecution for assaultive offense is each complian-
ant. See, Phillips v. State, 787 S.W.2d 391^95(Tex.Crim.App.(1990)(Assault)
Ex parte Rathnell, 717 S.W.2d 33 ,36 (Tex. Grim. App .1986) (VoltiintaEy/Manslaugh
ter) . Burglary, however is not an assaultive offense; rather, its place
ment within Title 2 indicates that the legislature determined burglary
to be crime against property. Thus the complainant is not the allowable
Vinit-of prosecution in burglary, rather, the allowable unit of prosecution
is the unlawful entry. When a defendant is convicted of two or more offense-
s that are the "same" for double-jeporady purposes, our case law tells
us that the conviction for the most serious offense is retained and the
other conviction is set aside. See, Landers v. State, 957 S.W.2d 558/5S9—
60 (Tex.Grim.App.1997). Landers statesr^that the ^ni©st?sgf:ious" offense is
determined by the degree of the felony range of punishment and sentence
imposed. Landers is overruled by Ex parte Cavazos'. The third reason
applies some what differently to the double-jeopardy ebntext than the
misjionder context, we.fashioned a rule'designed to best ascertain what
offense the State would elected to proceed upon upon at the time of trial.
We did so because, in the misjionder context the State is not permitted to
prosecute both offenses at the same time. Hence our evaluation of the
seriousness of the offense coming into play only when the cahgejof punish
ment and the degree of the offense being the same- It is this very rea
son why Petitioner need competent legal counsel, for the complexity of
such issue. Petitioner's counsel acted as No Counsel at All! We shall
visit the misjionder doctrine in our next point of error. For the record
reflects that double jeopardy has appeared from the record, to the degree
that both sentences are equal in respect that Petitioner was sentenced
to life on both Counts, and the Court has ruled in Gavazos, 203 S^W-3d 333
(Tex-Crim-2006)- The most serious offense retained.-In this case both
sentences are equal, thereby jeopardy nullifying both- There being jeo
pardy appearing from the record, said convictions should be remanded and
aggHi^tal?/ or in lieu with instructions. See also. Ex parte Castillo/ 432
S.W.3d 457 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2014, no pet. h.).

Under the applicable State prcedures there would have been an election,
and Petitioner would not have to face two offenses under the same jury.
Turning to the prejudice issue: Counsel Abandoned His Client; The manda

listed under Title 7 of the Penal Code. See/ Waythe v. State/ 533 S.W.2d

listed as an offense against the person, under Title Eive of the Penal

which follows from implicit statutory restrictions relating to the manner
in which non-property offenses may be joined in an indictment/ is support-

indictment two or more nonproperty offenses if those offenses arose out
of the same criminal "incident/ act or transaction'."" Generally/"transac
tion" has come to mean a criminal event and the various paetieulaf offenses
committed within that event. See, Drake/ supra/ at pp.945-49/ (Petitioner's
original Brief and Appendix pg.l6). Thereby counsel abandoning his client
in a^critical stage of the proceeding resulted in inadequacy of representa

State rules. It is senseless because unplanned and unintentional action
action of any kind generally is not;, subject to deterrance; and to the
extent that it is hoped that a; threatend sanction addressed to the defense
     induce greater care and caution on the part of trial lawyers, thereby
forestalling negligent conduct and errors The potential loss of valuable
State remedies would be sufficient to this end. And it is misdirected
sanction because even if penalization of incompetence or carelessness will
enciourage more legal trianing and trial. preparation / the Petitioner / \as
oppossed to his lawyer, hardly is the proper recipient of such a penalty.
Espicially with fundamental constitutional rights at stake, no fictional
relationship of principal-agent or the like can justify holdingthe crimi
nal defendant accountable for the naked errorscg^ his attorney. This is
espicially true when so many indigent defendants are without any realistic
choice in selecting who ultimately represents them at trial. Indeed, if
responsibilty for error must be apportioned between the parties, it is
the State through its attorney's admissions and certifications policies,
that is more fairly held to blame for the fact that practicing lawyers
too often are ill-equipped to act carefully and knowledgeably when faced
with decisions governed by State procedural requirements. Hence, Petitioner
agrees with the proper functioning of our system of criminal justice,
necessarily places a heavy reliance on the professionalism and the judgment
of trial attorneys. A system that ascribes absolute forefiture of Petition
er's constitutional claim where his lawyer manifestly excercise no pro
fessional judgment at ail-where carelessness, mistakes, or ignorance is
the explanation of the procedural defaults. It is regrettable that certain
errors/.that might have been cured earlier had trial counsel acted expediti-
ously, must be corrected collaterally and belatedly. Hence, Petitioner s
attorney was was deficient and such deficient conduct prejudiced the
 outcome of the trial. Because of attorney's acts and ommissions said cause

media coverage and that publicity regarding similar cases had the effect
of creating greater prejudice/ bringing "some afore-thought to people'
and making it "very hard" to find a fair and impartial jury. Petitioner's
attorney could, have called upon a number of potential witnessesa that
were listed on the prosecution's witness Irist for this eventuality. The ,
prosecution was prepared to fight a'change of venue motion/ witnesses from
several television stations/ newspapers/ and other social media outlets
were prepared to testify to the number of potential jurors exposed to these
segments. See/ (Appellants Brief Exhibit "C"). Petitioner's attorney could
have produced the requisite affidavits need to bolster his Client's positior
See/ (C.R. pg-30/32/ and 43). Here you have .77 members of the array who have
followed the case in the media, who have extensive knowledge of the case,
including kidnapping of Petitioner's son/ (ah offense he was not on trial
for), which further excebarrated the coverage and the amount of times this
coverage was repeated in a course of a year was-astronomlcal- Therefore,
even after the court conducted its vlbr.dire, it was clear from the record
that the trial court tried to rehabilitate the remainder of this poisoned
panel, we must also bear in mind, that the court was in a unique position
of hearing the testimony of the .jurors and guaglng the. siacerity of ,their
responses in light of the publicity about the case. Petitioner was entitled
to a change of venue if he could show that the there;.was influences in the
commiiiity which could affect answers on the vior dire. There are two
things that distinguish this case from others in which a majority of the
venire is familiar with- the case.. First the nature of the publicity is
quite different because/ Petitioner was a police officer/ there was a
buiglary/ a murder/ kidnapping/ an Amber alert went out/ there was a school
lockdown/ there was a Swat-standoff/hostage situation. NewsrStationsrreport
ed widely and did extensive coverage on the day of the offense/ and for a
year after until the date of trial. Potential jurors had the oppertunity to
watch it unfold. Second/ a large number of potential jurors could not set-
aside their opinion. This strongly indicates that pretrial publicity result
ed in actual identifiable prejudice to Petitioner. Also media coverage was
not accurate and objective/ because it reported an actual kidnapp were
there was none. Because Petitioner's attorney not filing the motion for
 change of venue, it rendered him deficient in his performance/ and because
 of -the ommission/ it is a probability that the outcome of the trial would
 have been different. It must be remembered that the court ordered a Gag
Order on the case. See, (CR.pg.30). Here we have the acts and ommisssions

 PROFILE CASE.

 In change of venue cases; T.C.C.P. art.31.01/ the trial judge should
 have filed her own motion to change venue after the vior dire revealed
 that Petitioner could not recieve a fair and impartial trial. Because
 the jury that was actually seated was tainted by the rest of the array,
 along with the fact that this case was tried in the media before the
 actual jury was pooled. The Sixth Amendment gives the Petitoner the
 right to, a fair and impartial trial/ it is the presiding judge who condu
 cts the vior dire. It was impossible to seat a- jury in this high profile,
 media driven trial, trial judge abused her discretion. The large number
 of venire panelist were disqualified for cause, because they could not
 not set aside their opinions of the. Petiioner's guilts See, (RR-vol.2/pg.

 case demonstrates the extent of the pretrial publicity had permeated the
 community. Here out of 100 a large percentage more than %could be- impag/
 tial and already formed their opinions. See, (RR.Vol.2/pg.31/22-25). These

Count II/ and resulted in the jury bein^ biased. A strategy the Petitioner
did not approve of/ nor able to communicate his disbelief about such
remarks that infringed upon his persumption of innocence, the Supreme Court
has longed recgonized that   'the right to counsel is the right to effective
assistance of counsel'" under the Sixth Amendment/ Strickland v. Washington
466 D.S. 688 (1984); In this case, We find that the defease counsel did
not put up any meaningful defense during the punishment phase/ nor file
any,pretrial motion that Petitioner was never convicted of any felony in
this State or any other State/ See, V.T.C.C.P. art.42-12(d)(8)(c) states:
A defendant is eligible for community supervision under this section only
if before the. trial begins the defendant files a sworn ai6£i6ft"to the judge
that the defedant has not been previously convicted of a    felony in this or
any other state/ and the jury enter in the verdict a finding that the infor
mation is true. See,   (RR.Vol.2/pga9/l-I7). Because of the forceful argument
by State's attorney Mr. McCaig that Petitioner was not eligible for proba
tion/ Petitioner's attorney should have researched further in the same
code to ascertain that Petitioner was eligible for probation. Furthermore/
counsel did not reasonably argue on his client's behalf during punishment
phase/ espicially in regard to Count II. See/   (RR.Vol.5.pg.126/3-13). Furthe

Television Documentary which featured Petitioner in family violence^ failed

illicit affairs with his wife there to testify. Nor did he interview them/
nor have them appear before the court/ Officers Noe Roel/ Emede Reyes/ Buzz

phone records.-See/ petitioner's appeal brief Exhibit "14-16"). That was
the extent of the preperatxon:for..the capital murder trial. Eortheraore/
although court ordered physcological testing of the Petitioner/ there was
no report by the psychologist included in the record/ nor was he called to
testify as to the Petitioner's mental state at the time of offense. Once
the attorney told the jury his client was guilty/ he was wholly unprepared
to make a platable defense of his theory/ and effectively undermined the
persumption of innocence in Count I and Count II. This was no defense at

to sentencing in Count II even more clearly indicate the abandonment
of his duty of loyalty/ by switching -from the jury to sentence/ to

performance and failure to fufill his duty of loyalty to his client is
from his behavior at     the t r i a l   itself.    "Counsel at the summation of the

trial    / counsel reffered to the difficulty his client had presented to
him. See,   (RR.vol.5.pg.99 / line 20-25/ Pg.lOOllilne 1-20) . Counsel is in
fact telling the jury he could not present any mitigating eirCQmstances/
when evidence against his client is so overwhelming. In closing counsel
lamenated :      (RR.Vol.5/pg.102/13-16). Petitioner's attorney did not simply
make poor choices; he acted with reckless disregard for his client's case.
Whatever the reason the record supports that counsel turned against his
client. There is no apperent reason for counseil's behavior/ although he
repeated many times that his client was guilty and how difficult this
case was. This conflict in loyalty               unquestionably affected his represen
tation. A defense attorney who abandons his duty of loyalty to his client
and effctively helps the State in an effort to obtain a conviction suffers
from an obivious conflict of interest^ Sich an attorney/-like unwanted
counsel/ ''represent' the defendant only through a legal fiction." See/
Faretta v. California/ 422 D-S- 806#821 (1975). In fact an attorney is
burdened by a conflict between his client's interest and his own sympa
thies to the prosecution's position is considerably worse than an attorney
with loyalty to other defendants/ because the interests of the State and
the defedant are necessarily in opposition. As the Supreme Court has
assereted: "The right to effective assitance of counsel M thus the right
of the accused to require the prosecution's to survive the crucible of
meaniningfuii adversarial testing. . . [i]f the process losses its character
as confrontation between adversaries/ the constitutional guarantee is
violated." See# Cronic# 466 U.S. at 656-57. Petitioner urges the Court/
that reversable error has appeared from the record because of sadd coun
sel's deficient performance that prejudiced the outcome of the trial.
Said cause should be reversed and remanded.

When considered with the facts and circumstances concerning an accused
and defense/ lay opinion testimony may be sufficient to raise the defense
of insanity. V-T.C.A./ Penal Code § 8.01. During the trial on the merits/
Petitioner's counsel raised the issue of Petitioner's mental state that
lead up to the commission of the offense. See/(RR.Vol.5/pg.99 line 25#pg.
100 line 1-2G).From the foregoing by Petitioner's counsel demonstrates
that he was of the opinion that his client "snapped." Which is eln off color
remark of insanity.Petitioner's attorney filed motion for psychological
testing which was granted by the court. See/ (CR-pg48). It appears from
the record that counsel was headed towards this defense/ then abandoned thi,
defense/ even thou that was the agreement between Petitioner and attorney.
Knowing that; Petitioner was a former Border patrol Agent/ got hurt on this
assignment/ suffered from Post Iraumatic Stress snydrome from this assign
ment. Also/ as an Alice Police Officer/ which greatly effected his physco-
logical well being/ coupled with the fact that Petitioner's wife was having
multiple affairs with Petitioner's co-workers who were Police Officers.
Also/ the amount of stress that police officers' experience on a day to day
level/ such amount of stress police officers' on a national level is well
documented, and the amount of domestic violence involving officers' and
members of the armed Forces in like situations. Petitioner's attorney was
derilict in his duty for not preparing for this defense, soi if by moral
insanity it be understood only a disorder or perverted state of affections
or moral powers of the mind/ it cannot soon be disgarded as -affording any
shelld from punishment for crime: if it can be truly said that one indulges
in violent emotions/ such as remorse/ anger/ shame/ grief/ and the like is
afflicted with homocidal insanity/ it would be diffucult/ yes/ impossible/
to say. where sanity ends/ and insanity begins* We say to you/ as a result of
our refelections on this branch of the subject/ that if the prisoner was
actuated by an irresistable inclination to kill/ and was unable to control
or subjugate his intellect... he is entitled to acquittal. (|te Justice
PaxsoH/ 88 PA.291/Jan.20/1879). What then is that form of diease/ Dominated
Ho'irtocidal Mania/ which will excuse one for having committed a Murder?
Cheif justice Gipson calls it that unseen ligament pressing on the mind
and drawing it to the consequences which it under coecerion which/ while
it results are clearly percieved-/ is incable of resistance-aii invisible
inclination to kill. It was error for trial counsel not ask for instructione
punishment stage of trial due to insanity/ furthermore/ Petitioner's attor
ney and State's attorney Ms. Dorsey put the charge together/ so it was
 ineffective assitance of counsel that his attorney subjected his cl

Petitioner would urge the Court/ that he falls under the narrow ruling in
Trevino        Th4ier/ wherein the record was fully developed and the errors
of his attorney were plain and apperrant. Said trial was overwhelmed by
media and public pressure/ which resulted in the impossibility to seat a
fair and impartial jury^/Petitioner was forced to wear leg shackles during
the entire trial with no demonstrative reason by trial                       judge/ and counsel
did not even object/ because he was assisting the State in helping to
obtain -a conviction - Counsel rendered     ineffective assistance on numerous
occasions/ destroying Petitioner's persumption of innocence when he decided
to abandon the temporary insanity defense and just throw his client to the
wovles. Petitioners appellate attorney completely missed the double jeopar
dy issue/and affadavit and information not being signed, as well as was
motivated by nepotism and other factors and filed a frivolous brief.
From the numerous litanies and acts and ommissions of counsels'                       in this
case.'     Said cause should be reversed and remanded.

JOSE GONZALES III,                                                          Appellant,




THE STATE OF TEXAS,                                                         Appellee.


                 On appeal from the lOSth District Court of
                              Nueces County, Texas.


                         MEMORANDUM OPINION

             Before Justices Rodriguez, Garza and Benavldes
                 Memorandum Opinion by Justice Garza

      Ajury found appellant Jose Gonzales III guilty of capital murder, a capital felony
offense, see Tex. Penal Code Ann. § 19.03(a)(2), (b) (West, Westlaw through 2013 3d
C.S.), and burglary of a habitation to cpmn^it afelony (aggravated assault), a first-degree
felony offense. See id. §30.02(a)(3), (d)(1) (West, Westlaw through 2013 3d C.S.). The
trial court assessed appellant's punishment for the capital murder offense at life without
parole, see id. § 12.31(a)(2) (West, Westlaw through 2013 3d C.S.), and assessed
punishment for the burglary of a habitation offense at life Imprisonment, with the
sentences ordered to run concurrently. Appellant's court-appointed counsel has filed an
Anders brief. See Anders v. Califomia, 386 U.S. 738, 744 (1967). We affirm.
                                           I. Anders Brief

        Pursuant to Anders v. Califomia, appellant's court-appointed appellate counsel
has fired a brief and a motion to withdraw with this Court, stating that his review of the

record yielded no grounds of error upon which an appeal can be predicated. See id.
Counsel'sbrief meets the requirements ofAnders as itpresents a professional evaluation
demonstrating why there are no arguable grounds to advance on appeal. See In re
Schulman, 262 S.W.3d 403, 407 n.9 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008) ("In Texas, an Anders brief
need not specifically advance 'arguable' points of error if counsel finds none, but it must
provide record references to the facts and procedural history and set out pertinent legal
authorities.") (citing Hawkins v. State, 112 S.W.3d 340, 343-44 (Tex. App.—Corpus
Christi 2003, no pet.)); Stafford v. State, 813 S.W.2d 503,510 n.3 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991).
        In compliance with High v. State, 573 S.W.2d 807, 813 (Tex. Crim. App. [Panel
Op.] 1978) and Kelly v. State, PD-0702-13, 2014 WL 2865901, at *3 (Tex. Crim. App.
June 25, 2014), appellant's counsel carefully discussed why, under controlling authority,
there is no reversible error inthe trial court's judgment. Counsel has informed this Court,
in writing, that counsel has; (1) notified appellant that counsel has filed an Anders brief
and a motion to withdraw; (2) provided the appellant with copies of both pleadings; and
(3) informed the appellant of appellant's rights to file a pro se response, and review the

        1The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has held that "the pro se response need not comply with
the rules of appellate procedure in order to be considered. Rather, the response should identify for the
 court those issues which the indigient appellant believes thecourt should consider in deciding whether the
                                                     2
record preparatory to filing that response. See Anders, 386 U.S. at 744; Kelly, 2014 WL

2865901, at *3, Stafford, 813 S.W.2d at 510 n.3: see also In re Schulman, 252 S.W.3d at

409n.23.

       The record shows that appellant was provided a copy of the record on October 21,

2013. After this Court granted several motions for extension of time in which to file his

pro se response, appellant filed his pro se response on May 23,2014.


                                       II. Independent Review


       Upon receiving an Anders brief, we must conduct a full examination of all the

proceedings to determine whether the case is wholly frivolous. Penson v. Ohio, 488 U.S.

75,80 (1988). When an Anders brief and a subsequent pro se response are filed, a court

of appeals reviews the entire record, and: (1) detemriines that the appeal is wholly

frivolous and issues an opinion explaining that it finds no reversible error; or (2)

determines that there are arguable grounds for appeal and remands the case to the trial

court for appointment of new appellate counsel. Bledsoe v. State, 178 S.W.3d 824, 826^

27 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005). If the court finds arguable grounds for appeal, it may not

review those grounds until after new counsel has briefed those issues on appeal. Id.

       We have reviewed the entire record, counsel's brief, and appellant's pro se

response, and we have found nothing that would arguably support an appeal. See id. at

827-28 ("Due to the nature of Anders briefs, by indicating in the opinion that itconsidered

the issues raised in the briefs and reviewed the record for reversible error but found none,

the court of appeals met the requirement of Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 47.1.");



case presents any meritorious issues." Inre Schulman, 252 S.W.Sd 403,409 n.23(Tex. Crim. App. 2008)
(quoting Wilson v. State, 955 S.W.2d 693,696-97 (Tex. App.—Waco 1997, no pet.)).
                                                3
Stafford, 813 S.W.2d at 509. There is no reversible error in the record. Accordingly, the

judgment of the trial court Is affinmed.

                                       III. Motion Tb Withdraw

        In accordance with Anders, appellant's attorney has asked this Court for

pemiission to withdraw as counsel for appellant. See Anders, 386 U.S. at 744; see also

In re Schulman, 252 S.W.3d at 408 n.17 (citing Jefferyv. State, 903 S.W.2d 776, 779-80

(Tex. App.—Dallas 1995, no jaet.) ("[I]f an attorney believes thei appeal is frivolous, he

must withdraw from representing the appellant. To withdraw from representation, the

appointed attomey must file a motion to withdraw accompanied by a brief showing the

appellate court that the appeal is frivolous.") (citations omitted)). We grant counsel's

motion to withdraw. Within five days of the date of this Court's opinion, counsel is ordered

to send a copy of this opinion and this Court's judgment to appellant and to advise him of

his right to file a petition for discretionaiy review.^ See Tex. R. App. P. 48.4; see also In

re Schulman, 252 S.W.3d at 412 n,35: Ex parte Owens, 206 S.W.3d 670,673 (Tex. Crim.

App. 2006).

         ^ No substitute counsel will be appointed. Siiould appellant wish to seel<further review of this case
by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, he must either retain an attomey to file a petition for discretionary
review or file a pro se petition for discretionary review. Any petition for discretionary review must be filed
within thirty days from the date of either this opinion or the last timely motion for rehearing or timely motion
for en banc reconsideration that was overruled by this Court. See Tex. R. App. P. 68.2. Any petition for
discretionary review must be filed with the clerk of the Court of Criminal Appeals, see Tex. R. App. P. 68.3,

68.4.

Delivered and Filed: November 7, 2018

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS DENIED

           Relator filed a petition for writ of mandamus complaining the trial court has refused to rule

on his motion for nunc pro tunc requesting jail-time credit.

           To establish a right to mandamus relief in a criminal case, the relator must show the trial

court violated a ministerial duty and there is no adequate remedy at law. In re State ex rel. Weeks,

391 S.W.3d 117, 122 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013) (orig. proceeding). A trial court has a ministerial

duty to rule on a properly-filed and timely-presented motion. See In re State ex rel. Young v. Sixth

Judicial Dist. Court of Appeals, 236 S.W.3d 207, 210 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (orig. proceeding).

           However, a relator has the burden of providing this court with a record sufficient to

establish his right to mandamus relief. See TEX. R. APP. P. 52.7(a)(1) (requiring relator to file “a

 This proceeding arises out of Cause No. 13-0772-CR-A #4, styled The State of Texas v. Matthew Paul Surber,
pending in the 2nd 25th Judicial District Court, Guadalupe County, Texas, the Honorable W.C. Kirkendall presiding.

certified or sworn copy of every document that is material to the relator’s claim for relief and that

was filed in any underlying proceeding”). In a case such as this one, a relator has the burden to

provide the court of appeals with a record showing the trial court was made aware of the motion

at issue and that such motion has not been ruled on by the trial court for an unreasonable period of

time. See In re Gallardo, 269 S.W.3d 643, 645 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2008, orig. proceeding).

       Attached to relator’s petition is a copy of a May 4, 2018 file-stamped copy of relator’s

Motion for Nunc Pro Tunc. However, the mandamus record does not contain copies of any letters

sent to the trial court or the appropriate court coordinator asking the trial court to rule on his

pending motion. Relator must show the matter was brought to the attention of the trial court. In

re Hearn, 137 S.W.3d 681, 685 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2004, orig. proceeding); see also In re

Bonds, 57 S.W.3d 456, 457 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2001, orig. proceeding) (conditionally

granting petition for writ of mandamus where record reflected relator filed motion and called

motion to court’s attention by letter). “Merely filing the matter with the district clerk is not

sufficient to impute knowledge of the pending pleading to the trial court.” Hearn, 137 S.W.3d at

685. Because relator has not demonstrated the trial court is aware of his pending motion, we must

deny his petition.

972 P.2d 566 (1999)
CITY OF TACOMA, a municipal corporation, Appellant,
v.
FRANCISCAN FOUNDATION, aka St. Joseph Hospital And Healthcare Center, a Washington nonprofit corporation, Respondent.
No. 23107-7-II.
Court of Appeals of Washington, Division 2.
March 5, 1999.
*567 Jean P Homan, Assistant City Attorney, Tacoma, for Appellant.
Linda Gayle White Atkins, Davis Wright Tremaine, Bellevue, for Respondent.
HOUGHTON, J.
The City of Tacoma (City) appeals a trial court order granting summary judgment in favor of St. Joseph Medical Center (St. Joesph). The trial court ruled that the City's anti-discrimination ordinance conflicts with state law and thus is unenforceable against religious nonprofit organizations. We agree and affirm.

FACTS
The facts are undisputed. St. Joseph is a hospital owned and operated by the Franciscan Health System-West, which is in turn owned and operated by Catholic Health Initiatives. All three entities are religious nonprofit organizations. In fall 1997, two St. Joseph's employees filed separate charges with the Tacoma Human Rights Department alleging religious, disability, race, and national origin discrimination under chapter 1.29 of the Tacoma Municipal Code (TMC).[1] St. Joseph challenged the City's jurisdiction to enforce its ordinance against it because St. Joseph is exempt from the state anti-discrimination law.
On December 5, 1997, the City filed a declaratory judgment action in superior court. Both parties moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted St. Joseph's motion and entered a judgment ruling that: (1) the Tacoma Human Rights Department does not have authority under TMC 1.29 to investigate claims of discrimination, make findings, and/or enforce civil penalties against St. Joseph because St. Joseph is expressly exempted from coverage of the state anti-discrimination law; (2) the City's definition of "employer" conflicts with the state definition of "employer" as to religious nonprofit organizations; (3) RCW 49.60.330 prohibits municipalities from enforcing anti-discrimination ordinances in a manner inconsistent with RCW 49.60; and (4) it is inconsistent with RCW 49.60 for the City to enforce its anti-discrimination ordinance against exempt religious organizations such as St. Joseph. The City appeals.

ANALYSIS

Standard of Review and Burden of Proof
The parties agree that review of this case is de novo,[2] but disagree as to St. Joseph's *568 burden of proof in challenging the City's ordinance. The City argues that St. Joseph bears the heavy burden of proving the ordinance unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. See Rabon v. City of Seattle, 135 Wash.2d 278, 287, 957 P.2d 621 (1998) (ordinance is presumed constitutional; heavy burden rests on challenger to establish unconstitutionality); City of Seattle v. Shin, 50 Wash. App. 218, 220, 748 P.2d 643 (party challenging constitutionality of ordinance must establish unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt), review denied, 110 Wash.2d 1025 (1988). St. Joseph counters it merely must show that the City's attempt to enforce its ordinance against St. Joseph exceeds its statutory grant of enforcement authority.
The Anti-discrimination Laws
Washington's Law Against Discrimination, RCW 49.60, permits injured persons to bring a civil action for employment discrimination. RCW 49.60.010, .030(2). Its definition of "employer" "includes any person acting in the interest of an employer ... who employs eight or more persons, and does not include any religious or sectarian organization not organized for private profit."[3] RCW 49.60.040(3). The law permits first-class cities to enact their own anti-discrimination ordinances and provide administrative remedies, as long as such ordinances and remedies are consistent with state law. RCW 49.60.330.
The Tacoma City Municipal Code contains an anti-discrimination ordinance that defines "employer" as "any person ... acting in the interests of an employer ... or who has any persons in his, her or its employ." TMC 1.29.030(E). Thus, it includes religious nonprofit organizations.[4]
The City's Enforcement Powers
The parties' disagreement regarding St. Joseph's burden of proof stems from their disagreement as to the source of the City's power to provide and enforce civil remedies for discrimination. St. Joseph argues that cities have no inherent authority under their police powers to enforce civil and equitable remedies.[5] Thus, the City's only power to provide such remedies arises from RCW 49.60.330.[6] St. Joseph, therefore, limits the inquiry to whether the City can provide anti-discrimination remedies that exceed the scope of authority granted it under RCW 49.60.330. Thus, St. Joseph asserts, the answer is "no" and only statutory construction is required to find in St. Joseph's favor.
The City contends that its constitutional grant of police powers includes civil and equitable enforcement measures.[7] The City claims that RCW 49.60.330 is permissive, not restrictive, and it can, therefore, provide *569 remedies greater than those permitted by the statute unless a constitutional conflict is shown.
In either case, the question is whether the City's ordinance conflicts with the state law. Because it clearly does, it must yield under both standards.[8]

Conflict Analysis
Under their constitutionally granted police powers, cities may enact ordinances prohibiting the same acts state law prohibits as long as the city ordinance does not conflict with the general laws of the state. City of Bellingham v. Schampera, 57 Wash.2d 106, 109, 356 P.2d 292 (1960). A local ordinance does not conflict with state law merely because one prohibits a wider scope of activity than the other. City of Seattle v. Eze, 111 Wash.2d 22, 33, 759 P.2d 366, 78 A.L.R.4th 1115 (1988) (citing Town of Republic v. Brown, 97 Wash.2d 915, 919, 652 P.2d 955 (1982)). In determining whether an ordinance conflicts with general laws, the test is: "whether the ordinance permits or licenses that which the statute forbids and prohibits, and vice versa." Schampera, 57 Wash.2d at 111, 356 P.2d 292 (quoting Village of Struthers v. Sokol, 108 Ohio St. 263, 140 N.E. 519 (1923)).
The City attempts to justify its ordinance under the foregoing rule by asserting that the state anti-discrimination law does not grant religious nonprofit groups a "license to discriminate." Rather, both the state and local schemes are intended to prohibit discrimination. Therefore the local ordinance does not conflict; it merely goes further in its prohibitions. See Brown v. City of Yakima, 116 Wash.2d 556, 562, 807 P.2d 353 (1991) ("Where both the ordinance and the statute are prohibitory, and the difference between them is that the ordinance goes further in its prohibition, they are not deemed inconsistent...."); State v. Rabon, 45 Wash.App. 832, 838, 727 P.2d 995 (1986) (question is whether statute authorizes conduct banned by ordinance).
The City's literal interpretation of the rule ignores that the state law expressly exempts religious nonprofit groups.[9] The cases relied upon by the City merely show that local regulations may prohibit conduct that similar state laws fail to address.[10]See, e.g., Shin, 50 Wash.App. at 226-27, 748 P.2d 643 (city may impose duty on parents to report child abuse though state statute omits parents from list of persons required to report); Rabon, 45 Wash.App. at 838, 727 P.2d 995 (state law banning chako sticks under certain circumstances does not preclude city from banning them entirely); Seattle Newspaper-Web Pressmen's Union Local No. 26 v. City of Seattle, 24 Wash.App. 462, 468-69, 604 P.2d 170 (1979) (ordinance may extend prohibition on unfair labor practices to practices not covered under state statute).
Although the state anti-discrimination law does not "authorize" religious groups to discriminate, it does "authorize" their exemption from the law's reach. The statutory *570 language indicates an affirmative policy choice rather than an omission. Because the City's ordinance contravenes this policy choice, it must give way. See Seattle Newspaper-Web, 24 Wash.App. at 469, 604 P.2d 170 (ordinance may be more restrictive than state statute only if statute does not forbid the more restrictive enactment) (emphasis added) (citing Lenci v. City of Seattle, 63 Wash.2d 664, 670-71, 388 P.2d 926 (1964)).

Williams, 128 Wash.2d 341, 347, 908 P.2d 359 (1995) (questions of law are reviewed de novo) (citing State v. McCormack, 117 Wash.2d 141, 143, 812 P.2d 483 (1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1111, 112 S.Ct. 1215, 117 L.Ed.2d 453 (1992)).
[3]  Persons aggrieved by the discrimination of religious nonprofit groups can seek redress under Title VII. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-1(a).
[4]  Although not at issue in this case, the City ordinance also purports to cover employers with fewer than eight employees, which are also exempt from the state law.
[5]  In support of this proposition, St. Joseph cites State v. Brennan, 76 Wash.App. 347, 884 P.2d 1343 (1994). The Brennan court held that the Legislature could not delegate equitable powers to the district courts because the state constitution vests exclusive equitable jurisdiction in the superior courts. Brennan, 76 Wash.App. at 349, 356, 884 P.2d 1343.
[6]  RCW 49.60.330 provides:

Any [first-class city] ... may enact resolutions or ordinances consistent with this chapter to provide administrative and/or judicial remedies for any form of discrimination proscribed by this chapter .... The superior courts shall have jurisdiction to hear all matters relating to violation and enforcement of such resolutions or ordinances, including ... the award of such remedies and civil penalties as are consistent with this chapter .... Any local resolution or ordinance not inconsistent with this chapter may provide, after a finding of reasonable cause to believe that discrimination has occurred, for the filing of an action in, or the removal of the matter to, the superior court.
(emphasis added).
[7]  Article XI, section 11 of the Washington Constitution grants first-class cities the power to "make and enforce within [their] limits all such local police, sanitary and other regulations as are not in conflict with general laws." This delegation of power is "as ample within its limits as that possessed by the legislature itself." Williams, 128 Wash.2d at 359, 908 P.2d 359.
[8]  Little authority elucidates the issue of the derivation and extent of a city's civil enforcement powers. Cities, pursuant to their police powers, possessed authority to prohibit discrimination before the enactment of RCW 49.60.330, but the extent of their power to create and enforce remedies apart from criminal sanctions was unclear. See AGO 1981, No. 14, at 3-4. In 1981, the Legislature enacted RCW 49.60.330 to "authorize[] what ha[d] been "existing in law." AGO 1981, No. 14, at 7 (quoting Senator Talmadge); see Laws of 1981, ch. 259, § 5. The amendment's legislative history confirms that the amendment was intended to be permissive, not preemptive, see AGO 1981, No. 14, at 6-7, but otherwise sheds little light on the question of what cities' preexisting enforcement powers were.
[9]  The religious exemption has been part of the anti-discrimination statute since it was enacted. It has never been amended, although the section in which it is contained has been amended many times, and the Legislature twice has considered narrowing or deleting the exemption. Farnam v. CRISTA Ministries, 116 Wash.2d 659, 673 n. 4, 807 P.2d 830 (1991) (citations omitted).
[10]  None of the cases the City cites in support of its contention that no conflict exists where the local prohibitory scheme merely goes further than the state scheme analyzes a state law containing an express exemption. See Rabon v. City of Seattle, 135 Wash.2d at 288, 957 P.2d 621; Brown, 116 Wash.2d at 558, 807 P.2d 353; Eze, 111 Wash.2d at 33, 759 P.2d 366; State ex rel. Schillberg v. Everett Dist.

*177 *178 *179 *180 JOHN FLOWERS, Bankruptcy Judge.
This memorandum announces my rulings on the summary judgment motions filed in the above-captioned cases. This case arose under the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 and I will hear it in two capacities, as a bankruptcy judge in connection with the adversary proceeding filed in the Bankruptcy Court by Fruehauf, and as a special master appointed by Judge Mahon of the U.S. District Court in connection with the suit pending in that court between the trustee, the debtors, Wanda Jo Mercer and Tommy Mercer as intervenors, and Fruehauf. However as it appears that the legal and factual issues are identical in all the proceedings, my rulings announced herein will be applicable to all the cases.
All parties have sought summary judgment on issues arising out of § 20a of the Interstate Commerce Act. Fruehauf seeks summary judgment on numerous other legal issues including limitations, estoppel and subordination. The court record consists of various stipulations, interrogatories and depositions. On the current state of the record, most of the motions for summary judgment are denied in view of the issues of fact that must be resolved before a judgment may properly be rendered. In this memorandum I will discuss the operative legal principals in order to elucidate the parties as to the fact issues that remain unresolved.

I.

SECTION 20a OF THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE ACT
Fruehauf Corporation has filed a complaint for relief from the stay asserting that T.E. Mercer Trucking Company and G.E.M. Storage & Terminal Company, Inc. are indebted to Fruehauf. The alleged indebtedness is evidenced by a series of voluminous loan agreements. Fruehauf claims mortgages and security interests in practically all assets of the debtor corporations, including equipment, vehicles, inventory, accounts, operating authorities and real property.
The debtor corporations, the trustee and the intervenors[1] urge the application of § 20a of the Interstate Commerce Act as a defense to liability and affirmatively as the basis of a claim against Fruehauf.[2] Fruehauf replies that § 20a is inapplicable because the loan agreements evidencing the debt are not "securities" and therefore fall outside the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Upon review of the authorities I am of the opinion that it is immaterial whether the loan agreements *181 fall within the purview of a "security" as defined by § 20a of the Interstate Commerce Act.
"The starting point in every case involving the construction of a statute is the language itself." International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. Daniel, 439 U.S. 551, 558, 99 S.Ct. 790, 795, 58 L.Ed.2d 808 (1979). Section 20a of the Interstate Commerce Act provides in pertinent part:
"ISSUANCE OF SECURITIES; ASSUMPTION OF OBLIGATIONS; AUTHORIZATION
(2) It shall be unlawful for any carrier to issue any share of capital stock or any bond or other evidence of interest in or indebtedness of the carrier (hereinafter in this section collectively termed "securities") or to assume any obligation or liability as lessor, lessee, guarantor, indorser, surety, or otherwise, in respect of the securities of any other person, natural or artificial, even though permitted by the authority creating the carrier corporation, unless and until, and then only to the extent that, upon application by the carrier, and after investigation by the commission of the purposes and uses of the proposed issue and the proceeds thereof, or of the proposed assumption of obligation or liability in respect of the securities of any other person, natural or artificial, the commission by order authorizes such issue or assumption. The commission shall make such order only if it finds that such issue or assumption: (a) is for some lawful object within its corporate purposes, and compatible with the public interest, which is necessary or appropriate for or consistent with the proper performance by the carrier of service to the public as a common carrier, and which will not impair its ability to perform that service, and (b) is reasonably necessary and appropriate for such purpose."
In 1935, the scope of the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA) was extended to cover common carrier by motor vehicle, see 49 U.S.C. §§ 301-327, Part II of the ICA. Section 214 of the ICA, 49 U.S.C. § 314 (now 49 U.S.C. § 11302) makes the provisions of Sections 20a(2)-(11) applicable to motor common carriers.
Section 20a of the Interstate Commerce Act has been aptly described as an "early essay in securities legislation," see United States v. New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad, 276 F.2d 525 (2nd Cir. 1959), cert. denied, 362 U.S. 961, 80 S.Ct. 877, 4 L.Ed.2d 876 (1960). A threshold issue is whether this essay in securities legislation may be asserted by the trustee, the debtor corporation and the intervenors against Fruehauf's claim. A review of the legislative history and court interpretations of the purpose of § 20a provide some insight to whether these parties have standing to urge the application of the statute.
The legislative history reflects that one of the purposes Congress enacted § 20a was to protect investors. Consider the somewhat optimistic arguments of Representative Rayburn who sponsored an early draft of the statute:
"Of course, the credit of the railroads has been destroyed. But if we write into the law of the land a statute to the effect that before a railroad can issue new securities, before it can put them on the market it must come before the properly constituted government agency, lay the full facts of its financial situation before that body, tell that body what it intends to do with the money derived from the sale of the issue of securities and after it has received the approval of that regulating body and it goes out and puts those securities on the market then the Interstate Commerce Commission by this law is empowered at any time to call it to account and have it tell to that regulating body that it expended the money, the proceeds of the sale of securities, for the purposes for which it had made the application. Then we shall have railroad securities that will stand for value in the markets of the country and in the markets of all the world." 59 Cong.Rec. 8376 (1919).
In Interstate Investors, Inc. v. United States, 287 F.Supp. 374, 387 (S.D.N.Y., 1968) *182 (three-judge court) aff'd per curiam, 393 U.S. 479, 89 S.Ct. 707, 21 L.Ed.2d 687 (1969), the court stated the dominant Congressional purpose in enacting § 20a was to protect investors in the securities of railroads.
The remedies for violations of the statute confirm that the statute is intended to protect investors. Section 20a(11) provides that the holder of a void security acquired directly from the carrier may at his option rescind the transaction and upon surrender of the security recover the consideration given therefor. If a voided security is acquired for value and in good faith and without notice that the issue or assumption is void, such person may in a suit hold jointly and severally liable for the full amount of the damage sustained by him, the carrier which issued the security and its directors and officers who participated in the authorizing, issuing or selling of the security. Interestingly, Congress omitted the "good faith" requirement with respect to the holders of void securities acquired directly from the carrier which appears to encourage the direct extension of credit to a carrier.
Section 20a has somewhat of a dual function in view of the role given the Interstate Commerce Commission by the statute. The Commission was created for the purpose of facilitating commerce throughout the nation, Texas & P.R. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., 204 U.S. 426, 27 S.Ct. 350, 51 L.Ed. 553 (1907). The Interstate Commerce Commission may approve an application for authorization to issue securities, only if it finds that such issue or assumption: (a) is for some lawful object within its corporate purposes, and compatible with the public interest, which is necessary or appropriate for or consistent with the proper performance by the carrier of service to the public as a common carrier, and which will not impair its ability to perform that service, and (b) is reasonably necessary and appropriate for such purpose. Section 20a(2). The Second Circuit has expounded upon the "in the public interest" function of Section 20a,
". . . we prefer a construction of Section 20a of the Interstate Commerce Act that gives effect to its remedial purposes to give the commission control over stock and bond issues in order to avoid for the future abuses in the issuance of securities whereby railroad properties have been bankrupted or saddled with almost overwhelming burdens of indebtedness, which have not increased the amount of or value of property devoted to the public service, have not improved the service rendered, and have on the whole had the effect of increasing the charges for the service,"
United States of America v. New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad Co., et al, 276 F.2d 525 (2nd Cir. 1959).
I find that the purpose and function of § 20a is twofold, (1) to protect investors from worthless issues of railroad and common carrier securities, and (2) to protect the public interest in the efficient and economical operation of interstate carriers. Consequently this "early essay" in securities regulation conceivably may operate to protect both purchasers of securities and the public interest by preserving the financial integrity of the railroad and common carrier securities.
With the above considerations in mind, I turn to an issue that has been marginally addressed by the parties. The trustee and Mercer seek to avoid liability on the theory that the consolidated loan agreements are § 20a securities. It is argued that the securities are void because a statutory duty has been breached by the failure to have Commission approval of the issue.
However, a breach of a statutory duty does not give rise to a private cause of action to every person injured by the statutory breach. The law clearly demands that the statutory breach must cause injury to one of the class that the statute is designed to protect, Greater Iowa Corporation v. McLendon, 378 F.2d 783, 790 (8th Cir. 1967); Cambridge Capital Corporation v. Northwestern National Bank, 350 F.Supp. 829 (D.Minn., 1972).
*183 Section 20a does not purport to protect the issuer of securities. In fact it places the risk of non-compliance upon the issuer and its directors, officers, attorneys and other agents, who participated in the issuing of the voided security. The trustee and Mercer seek to shift the risk of noncompliance upon the holder (Fruehauf) by requesting the court to void the debt or in the alternative void the security interests and mortgages that secure the debt. The remedy for violation of § 20a proposed by the trustee, which in effect penalizes the investor, stands contrary to the primary purpose of the statute which is to protect investors. The trustee and debtor have focused on the use of the "security . . . shall be void" language. The court, however in interpreting a statute, must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but must look to the provisions of the whole law and to its object and policy, Philbrook v. Glodgett, 421 U.S. 707, 95 S.Ct. 1893, 44 L.Ed.2d 525 (1975). The statute clearly contemplates that the holder of an unauthorized § 20a security may assert a rescission claim against the issuer. If the § 20a security is in the form of a bond or other debt instrument secured by an interest in property, I am of the opinion that the bondholder's rescission claim under § 20a(11) would likewise be treated as secured in the bankruptcy context. It would be absurd to interpret this investor protective statute so as to give the investor a remedy of rescission, yet if such remedy is exercised the investor forfeits any liens securing the indebtedness. In interpreting a statute, the courts are to respect the policy of Congress so as not to impute to the statute a self-defeating, if not disingenuous purpose, Dalia v. U.S., 441 U.S. 238, 99 S.Ct. 1682, 60 L.Ed.2d 177 (1979).
The trustee and Mercer have raised the spectre of Fruehauf's heavy-handed lending practices in attacking Fruehauf's claim. Noting that the proceeds of the trucking company loan went toward the retirement of personal debts and beer inventories, the brief of the Plaintiff-Debtor raises the rhetorical question: "Is there the slightest doubt in the Court's mind what would have happened to this agreement had it been presented to the Interstate Commerce Commission for approval?"
I have no serious doubts about how the Commission would have ruled with respect to some of the indebtedness in view of the posture taken by the Commission in numerous decisions, see Mutrie Motor Transportation, Inc., 116 Motor Carrier Cases 99 (1972). But I do entertain serious doubts that Congress intended § 20a to be used as a vehicle by carriers to avoid undesired investment obligations.
This is not to say that I endorse Fruehauf's alleged conduct which suggests an intent on Fruehauf's part to circumvent I.C.C. review of the consolidated loan agreements. Fruehauf's conduct will be carefully scrutinized for misconduct that may mandate application of the court's equitable subordination powers.
However Congress chose not to include a statutory remedy for misconduct on the part of the holder of a § 20a security. Consequently I hold that the trustee and Mercer lack standing to assert a claim based on the alleged violation of § 20a of the I.C.C. Act. Thus it is unnecessary to decide whether the consolidated loan agreements are § 20a securities.[3] Fruehauf's *184 motion for summary judgment on this issue will be granted.

II.

THE ALLOCATION OF DEBT LIABILITY AND USURY CLAIMS
The court has under review a series of agreements regarding the indebtedness owing from what are described as the "Corporate Debtors" and the "Guarantors." These agreements were preceded by loans to various entities at different times, the details of which are not before the court. The parties agree at least some of the prior loans were to entities other than the "Corporate Debtors" and the "Guarantors." The initial consolidated loan agreement dated December 1, 1969, contains a listing and acknowledgment of existing obligations owing to Fruehauf. The agreement recites, "Whereas the parties hereto desire to consolidate the obligations owing to Fruehauf in a single loan arrangement without altering the existing obligations or security given therefor." After reciting various debts and future advances the agreements sets forth a payment schedule, with payments to be made by the Corporate Debtors.
Apparently only two corporate entities survived to actively participate in the September 16, 1977 agreement, T.E. Mercer Trucking Company and G.E.M. Storage & Terminal Co., Inc. In this agreement the corporate debtor and guarantor parties "recognize, admit and affirm all of the foregoing indebtedness owing by them, individually, jointly or severally, to Fruehauf Corporation." Fruehauf was given the right to "undertake and order the liquidation of some, any and all of the assets of either or both of said corporations and/or the equipment company and/or claimed sole proprietorships and apply the net proceeds thereof to the indebtednesses owing by the debtor and guarantor parties to Fruehauf Corporation."
Oddly enough none of the various agreements go so far as to recite that the corporate debtors are jointly and severally liable for the entire indebtedness. The trustee, debtors and intervenors contend that the 1969 agreement constituted simply a convenient means to include in one document provisions relating to different loans, and thus each entity is obligated only for the repayment of monies that went to its benefit. Fruehauf responds that the parties intended the corporate debtors to be co-obligors under the consolidated loan agreement in spite of the fact that they received unequal benefits. Fruehauf asserts that a "community of interest" provides sufficient consideration to create a joint and several obligation and thus each corporate debtor is liable for the entire indebtedness.
The central issue is whether the parties intended the "corporate debtors" to be jointly and severally liable for the aggregate amount of indebtedness reflected in the various consolidated loan agreements or whether the parties intended the agreements to be a mere reaffirmation of existing indebtedness with each corporate debtor liable only for its historical share of the total indebtedness recited.[4] This issue is *185 important because it will determine the amount of each entity's liability to Fruehauf. Once each entity's liability is established the effective interest rate charged by Fruehauf may be calculated by comparing the interest charged to each entity's debt liability. If each corporate debtor were obligated for the entire indebtedness the interest to debt ratio would obviously be less than if each debtor is liable only for its historical share of the debt.
Ultimately the court must interpret the language of the consolidated loan agreements. Under the parole evidence rule, the standard of interpretation of a written contract is usually the meaning that would be attached to it by a reasonably intelligent person acquainted with all operative usages and knowing all the circumstances prior to, and contemporaneous with, the making of the contract other than the oral statements by the parties of what they intended it to mean, Zell v. American Seating Co., 138 F.2d 641 (2nd Cir. 1943). I believe it appropriate to allow the parties an opportunity to develop the circumstances surrounding the execution of the loan agreements for the purpose of ascertaining the parties' intent. Consequently I will deny summary judgment on the issue of whether each corporate debtor was intended to be liable on the entire consolidated indebtedness or only its historical share.
Several subsidiary issues will arise upon my deciding the above issue. Assuming a finding that the "corporate debtors" intended to be jointly and severally liable for the entire consolidated indebtedness, the issue of sufficient consideration comes into view. The trustee, debtors and intervenors rely on V.T.C.S. art. 1302-2.06 which provides that no corporation "shall create any indebtedness whatever except for money paid, labor done, which is reasonably worth at least the sum at which it was taken by the corporation, or property actually received, reasonably worth at least the sum at which it was taken by the corporation." This statute is declaratory of the common law of ultra vires as it existed before its enactment, Cooper Petroleum Co. v. LaGloria Oil & Gas Co., 423 S.W.2d 645 (Tex.Civ.App.Houston [14th Dist., 1967]). Historically Texas courts were reluctant to enforce one entity's indebtedness against a guarantor corporation where the guarantor received no substantial benefit from the guarantee, see Rio Grande Valley Gas Co. v. Grand Rapids Store Equipment Corporation, 57 S.W.2d 348 (Tex.Civ.App.San Antonio, 1933) no writ. hist. However by the enactment of art. 2.04 A of the Texas Business Corporation Act the legislature precluded a corporation from pleading ultra vires as the basis for a claim or defense when sued on its contract, Cooper Petroleum, supra; Inter-Continental Corp. v. Moody, 411 S.W.2d 578, (Tex.Civ.App. Houston, 1967) and Republic National Bank of Dallas v. Whitten, 383 S.W.2d 207 (Tex. Civ.App.Dallas, 1964) aff'd 397 S.W.2d 415 (Tex., 1966). Consequently the provisions of art. 1302-2.06 may only be asserted as the basis for a claim against the directors and officers who have benefited from the ultra vires activities.
Thus in the event the consolidated loan agreements were intended to create a joint and several liability on the part of the debtor corporations, the trustee and Mercer may not assert art. 1302-2.06 as a defense to joint and several liability of each debtor corporation. I am further of the opinion that the trustee and Mercer may not assert art. 1302-2.06 for the purpose of determining each debtor corporation's principal balance owing in order to set up a usury claim against Fruehauf.
Returning now to the primary fact inquiry and assuming I find the parties intended that the corporate debtors would be liable only for their historical portion of the consolidated indebtedness (as the trustee and Mercer contend), an alternative usury claim might be asserted under the rule of Windhorst v. Adcock Pipe and Supply, 547 S.W.2d 260 (Tex., 1977). This usury claim would be based on the fact that although each debtor corporation is liable only to the *186 extent of its historical portion of the consolidated indebtedness, Fruehauf charged or received from each debtor corporation interest on the entire indebtedness. The ratio of total interest received or charged vis-a-vis the amount actually owed by each corporate debtor could exceed the legal interest rates.
To illustrate this usury theory, assume that three individuals, A, B, C, each purchases from store F a $200 item on credit. Each signs a promissory note for $200 payable at a lawful annual percentage rate of 18%. One year later the store sends A a statement charging interest in the amount of $108 (18% times $600) intending to hold A liable for the entire amount of interest charged. Under the Windhorst decision, A would have a usury claim against F whether or not any interest was actually paid.
Assume that A, B, C and store F executed a consolidated agreement which lists all indebtedness owed by A, B, and C, however it provides that F may recover from A only its share of principal and interest, and likewise limits F's recovery from B and C to their proportionate share of accrued interest and principal. In such case F has "contracted" for legal interest. But further assume that F subsequently sends A a bill for the total accrued interest of $108. In such event F would have "charged" A usurious interest within the meaning of Article 5069-1.06 as interpreted by the Windhorst decision, supra.
The action taken by F in billing A for the entire amount manifests an intent to repudiate the prior agreement and charge a usurious interest rate to A. The subjective intent of the creditor to charge only a legal rate of interest is immaterial, see Cochran v. American Savings and Loan, 586 S.W.2d 849 (Tex., 1979). To avoid usury penalties F must plead and prove that such charge and receipt of usury was a result of accidental and bona fide error.
Finally it is possible to interpret the consolidated loan agreement in a manner such that the parties "contracted" for a usurious interest rate. Such construction would require my finding that although Fruehauf could hold each corporate debtor liable only for its historical portion of the consolidated debt, Fruehauf could nevertheless hold each corporate debtor responsible for the aggregate interest accruing on the entire consolidated debt. I find the language of the agreements sufficiently ambiguous so that as a matter of law I am unable to preclude such a construction. However it is fair to state at this juncture that to interpret the consolidated loan agreements so that the corporate debtors are not jointly and severally liable on the consolidated debt and yet are jointly and severally liable as to the accrued interest on the consolidated debt would be a bit strained.
I am unable to conclude as a matter of law that Fruehauf is not liable for the usury penalties provided by article 5069-1.06 V.T.C.S. Consequently the motion for summary judgment on the usury issue is denied in view of the factual issues that remain unresolved.

III.

THE ISSUE OF STANDING
In response to Fruehauf's motion for relief from the stay, the trustee answered and counterclaimed that Fruehauf was the partner, joint venturer or in the alternative the alter ego of the debtor. This position is based on the undisputed fact that at various times Fruehauf assumed management responsibilities and incurred debt for the debtor pursuant to the terms of the consolidated loan agreements. In its motion for summary judgment Fruehauf asserts that neither the trustee nor debtor has "standing" to assert the partnership, joint venture or alter-ego theory.
The law of standing, the Supreme Court says, is a "complicated specialty of federal jurisdiction, the solution of whose problems is in any event more or less determined by the specific circumstances of individual situations," U.S. ex rel. Chapman v. Federal Power Comm., 345 U.S. 153, 156, 73 S.Ct. 609, 612, 97 L.Ed. 918 (1953). The *187 federal courts are to look into the nexus between the status asserted by the litigant and the claim he presents to assure that he is a proper and appropriate party to invoke federal judicial power, Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 101, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 1953, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968).
Fruehauf contends that the trustee does not have standing to recover alleged debts owing to the creditors of the bankrupt from the partner, joint venture or alter ego of the bankrupt. I hold the trustee does not have the right to collect debts from alleged non-bankrupt partner,[5] joint venturer or alter ego. Such cause of action belongs solely to each partnership creditor, see for example Krivo Industrial Sup. Co. v. National Distill., 483 F.2d 1098 (5th Circuit, 1973). The trustee however does have standing to assert the partnership, joint venture or alter ego status for the purpose of subordinating one creditor's claim to the claims of other creditors under the doctrine of equitable subordination. I will therefore grant Fruehauf's motion for summary judgment on the trustee's lack of standing issue except to the extent the trustee relies on the partnership, joint venture or alter ego theory as the basis for subordinating Fruehauf's claim to those of other creditors.

IV.

I.C.C. PERMIT ISSUE
The trustee alleges Fruehauf took control and possession of Mercer and its I.C.C. permits without the approval of the Commission and such fact renders invalid any pledge of the permits. Fruehauf has moved for a summary judgment on this issue. It has received minimal attention in the briefs and arguments of counsel and no authorities have been cited in support or contrary to Fruehauf's motion. However in view of the representations of counsel during the hearing on this motion held on August 5, 1981, that this issue will receive further attention, I will at this point deny Fruehauf's motion for summary judgment on the void pledge issue.

V.

THE WAIVER AND ESTOPPEL ISSUES
Fruehauf in its motion for summary judgment asserts that the debtor corporations and guarantors waived any defenses or counterclaims to Fruehauf's claims pursuant to the agreement of September 16, 1977 which states in pertinent part:
"All of the undersigned debtor and guarantor parties hereto: Recognize, admit and affirm all of the foregoing indebtedness owing by them, individually, jointly or severally to Fruehauf Corporation, and acknowledge that all of the same have been matured and are now owing, past due, and not subject to credit offset or counter-claims of any kind."
The trustee and Mercer have countered that such agreement was conditioned on certain subsequent events which never materialized. At the summary judgment hearing on August 5, 1981, Fruehauf urged that the 1977 agreement equitably estopped Mercer from asserting defenses and claims arising out of the loan agreements.
Factual issues exist which preclude my granting a summary judgment on the waiver and estoppel theories. Waiver is operative only where the person charged has actual or constructive knowledge of all the material facts concerning the right or privilege involved. No one can be said to have waived that which he does not know, Bering Mfg. Co. v. Carter and Bro., 255 S.W. 243 (Tex.Civ.App.Beaumont, 1923) affirmed 272 S.W. 1105; see also 60 Tex. Jur.2d Waiver § 6, p. 187. A factual issue exists as to whether the corporate debtors relinquished a known right for a valuable consideration.
As to Fruehauf's estoppel claim, Fruehauf must show that it acted upon Mercer's representations without knowledge of the falsity of such representations. *188 To successfully urge estoppel, Fruehauf must show not only ignorance of the true circumstances of a transaction, but also that there was no convenient or available means of acquiring knowledge of the truth with reference thereto, Holland v. Blanchard, 262 S.W. 97 (Tex.Civ.App.Dallas, 1924) err. dismd. A fact issue exists as to whether Fruehauf had knowledge of the existence of offsets, credits and counterclaims when Mercer signed the September 16, 1977 agreement. Furthermore the party claiming it was misled by the representations must show that it changed position in a manner that it will be injured if estoppel is not invoked, Stanolind Oil & Gas Co. v. Midas Oil Co., 173 S.W.2d 342 (Tex.Civ.App. Galveston, 1943) revd. on other grounds 179 S.W.2d 243.

VI.

THE "ANTITRUST" VIOLATION
Fruehauf seeks a summary judgment on the anti-trust issue contending that no summary judgment evidence exists to support the anti-trust action alleged by the trustee and Mercer. While the anti-trust issue has received minimal attention in the pleadings and briefs of the parties, there is before the court excerpts from depositions, interrogatories and agreements which if viewed most favorably to the trustee and Mercer provide some faint evidence of an anti-trust violation. It is expected that the trustee and Mercer will more fully develop the alleged violations before the trial of this matter. At this juncture Fruehauf's motion for summary judgment is denied.

VII.

CONSOLIDATION
Fruehauf seeks summary judgment denying consolidation of the bankruptcy estates of T.E. Mercer Trucking Company and G.E.M. Storage and Terminal in the event it is found that the corporate debtors are not jointly and severally liable for Fruehauf's total claims. The bankruptcy court has jurisdiction to consolidate proceedings and to merge the assets and the liabilities of the debtors. This jurisdiction is based on considerations of equity, one of the touchstones of the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction, Bank of Marin v. England, 385 U.S. 99, 87 S.Ct. 274, 17 L.Ed.2d 197 (1966). However the court must be mindful that consolidation in bankruptcy is no mere instrument of procedural convenience but a measure vitally affecting substantive rights, In the Matter of Flora Mir Candy Corp., 432 F.2d 1060, 1062 (2nd Cir. 1970). In the case sub judice Fruehauf asserts that consolidation will injure its substantive rights. Of course Fruehauf's rights have been challenged and further fact finding must occur before the extent and priority of those rights may be determined. Controverted issues of fact are thus implicit in the consolidation issue, and Fruehauf's motion for summary judgment on consolidation is denied pending resolution of the enforceability and priority position of its claims.

VIII.

STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS
Fruehauf asserts that the offsets, credits and defenses claimed by the trustee and Mercer are barred by limitations. However it is settled by many decisions that the statute of limitations is not applicable to matters set up strictly by way of defense, Rutherford v. Carr, 99 Tex. 101, 87 S.W. 815 (1905); Morriss-Buick Co. v. Davis, 127 Tex. 41, 91 S.W.2d 313 (Sec. A, 1936), 37 Tex.Jur.2d Limitations of Actions § 18. Fruehauf's motion for summary judgment on the statute of limitations issue is denied, however I reserve opinion as to whether the trustee's and Mercer's claims against Fruehauf are barred by limitations if asserted affirmatively as a ground for recovery rather than as a defense to the alleged indebtedness.

IX.

THE POST-PETITION RECEIVABLE ISSUE
The trustee and Mercer seek to attack Fruehauf's secured status by questioning *189 whether post-petition receivables of Mercer may be substituted as Fruehauf's collateral for pre-petition receivables consumed by the trustee's post-petition operations. Again overriding this issue is the factual determination to be made as to the priority of Mercer's indebtedness to Fruehauf. Assuming that such indebtedness exists, and the security interests are not subordinated on other grounds, I will follow the rule of In the Matter of Sequential Information Systems, Inc., 4 C.C.H. Sec. Trans. Guide ¶ 51479 (S.D.N.Y., 1970). In that decision the court held that a creditor secured by inventory has no right, title or interest in and to and no claim upon inventory purchased by the debtor-in-possession subsequent to the filing of the petition for arrangement herein and any accounts receivable created from the sale thereof, except insofar as such inventory is paid for with funds of the debtor which is subject to the creditor's pre-petition lien.
To the extent that Fruehauf traces the proceeds of encumbered pre-petition assets into post-petition property or accounts acquired by the trustee or debtor-in-possession, I hold it has an enforceable lien on such post-petition assets. Plaintiff's summary judgment motion is denied in view of the lack of a factual record before the court to determine which pre-petition and post-petition property is subject to the lien.

X.

EQUITABLE SUBORDINATION
It is clear that a factual issue exists as to whether Fruehauf may be equitably subordinated to other creditors. Before the court may exercise its equitable power three conditions must be met: (1) the claimant must have engaged in some type of inequitable conduct; (2) the misconduct must have resulted in injury to the creditors of the bankrupt or conferred an unfair advantage on the claimant; and (3) equitable subordination of the claim must not be inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, see In re Multiponics, 622 F.2d 709 (5th Cir. 1980); In the Matter of Mobile Steel Co., 563 F.2d 692, 700 (5th Cir. 1977). The claims however may be subordinated only to the extent necessary to offset the unfair advantage or the harm which the creditors suffered on account of the inequitable conduct, Mobil at 701. Fruehauf argues it should not be responsible for any creditor harm from its actions because creditors could have ascertained that Fruehauf had liens on substantially all of the debtor's property and any extensions of credit were imprudent. The doctrine of equitable subordination deals with inequitable conduct resulting in either unfair advantage or creditor harm and is not dependent on creditor reliance or prudence. Actual fraud need not be established, Multiponics at 720.
As discussed earlier in the opinion, I will give significant attention to alleged conduct of Fruehauf in seeking to circumvent the review by the Interstate Commerce Commission of the consolidated loan agreements. If such intent to circumvent I.C.C. control is found and if I find that the conduct resulted in fewer assets available for distribution to the unsecured creditors, Fruehauf's claim will be subordinated to the extent the unsecured creditors were injured.
The court will also look at the "creditor control" exercised by Fruehauf pursuant to the various consolidated loan agreements. These remarkable loan contracts gave Fruehauf joint control of all bank accounts of the Corporate Debtors requiring co-signatures for substantial checks, gave Fruehauf the right to place its designee on the Board of Directors of the Debtors; required all corporate by-laws, stock books and certificates to be delivered to Fruehauf's counsel; gave Fruehauf the right to have one of its employees participate in the day-to-day operations of the Debtor's premises with complete veto powers on any items or matters whatsoever; gave Fruehauf the right to require the liquidation of all assets of the Debtors and the various other ventures; gave Fruehauf the right to set salaries of officers and directors; required the Corporate Debtors to pledge all their stock, and provided in the event of a dispute between the Mercer management and the Fruehauf *190 monitoring agent that an appeal would lie to the Fruehauf management for final determination.
The extensive creditor control evidenced by the loan agreement suggests that the debtor corporations were mere instrumentalities or the alter ego of Fruehauf. If Fruehauf's actual control was as dominant as the consolidated loan agreements indicate, such fact pattern may satisfy the inequitable conduct element of the trustee's subordination claim, see In re American Lumber Co., 5 B.R. 470 (D.Minn., 1980). If I find Fruehauf gained an unfair advantage or that creditors suffered harm as a result of its alleged control, the bankruptcy court's equitable powers may be invoked to subordinate Fruehauf's claims to the extent necessary to remedy the inequitable conduct. The trustee is allowed leave to amend its pleading so as to make a more definitive statement of Fruehauf's inequitable conduct and the nature and extent of any alleged damages.
The determination necessary to resolve the subordination issue will require further evidentiary hearings. Consequently Fruehauf's motion for summary judgment on equitable subordination issue is denied.
The foregoing constitutes my conclusions of law pursuant to F.R.C.P. 52 and my initial report as special master pursuant to F.R.C.P. 53(e).
NOTES
[1]  The intervenors are the sole stockholders of the debtor corporations and are guarantors of much of the corporate debt.
[2]  At the summary judgment hearing on August 5, 1981 the debtor, trustee and intervenors announced they would no longer urge a usury claim based on the allegation the debt to Fruehauf is void under § 20a. This concession anticipated my ruling on this issue. A void debt may not be the subject of a usury claim. O'Quin v. Beanland, 540 S.W.2d 526 (Tex.Civ. App.San Antonio, 1976) no writ. hist.
[3]  The parties extensively briefed the issue of what evidences of indebtedness fall within the purview of § 20a. All recognize that Ex parte 275 [Association of American Railroad v. U.S.], 603 F.2d 953 (D.C.Cir.1979) is the leading authority. It sets forth two salient factors in determining whether a particular transaction is a security under § 20a. The first factor looks to general principals of federal securities laws to determine whether the debt is in the nature of a security. The Fifth Circuit follows the investment/commercial dichotomy test which is premised on the view that Congress' concern in enacting the securities laws was to regulate practices associated with investment transactions and that the securities laws were not designed to regulate commercial transactions. McClure v. National Bank of Lubbock, 497 F.2d 490 (5th Cir. 1974), focused upon two factors in determining whether "notes" are securities: (1) were the notes offered to some class of investors or were they acquired by the creditor for speculation or investment, (2) alternatively did the debtor obtain investment assets, directly or indirectly, in exchange for its notes. The investment/commercial dichotomy provides an analysis helpful in explaining the holdings in numerous I.C.C. cases cited by the parties, see Lehigh Valley Railroad Company, 1 Fed. Carrier Cases 328 (1939); Mutrie Motor Transportation, Inc., 116 M.C.C. 99 (1972) and Hays Freight Line, Inc., 39 M.C.C. 576 (1944).

Ex parte 275 further recognized that § 20a was intended to be limited to "issues" of securities, and thus imposed an element that the security be in transferable form. A transferable evidence of indebtedness is one that has negotiable or quasi-negotiable characteristics; see REA Express, Inc. v. Alabama Great Southern, 427 F.Supp. 1157 (S.D.N.Y., 1976), and Transcontinental Bus System, Inc., 80 M.C.C. 54 (1959). The second element is met if the debt instrument is in a form that the issuer and initial holder of the instrument could reasonably anticipate that the instrument would be transferred to a member of the class that § 20a is designed to protect. However I find it unnecessary to apply this analysis to the consolidated loan agreement as I conclude that § 20a does not operate to deprive Fruehauf of its secured creditor status even in the event the agreement is a security.
[4]  I am addressing the in personam liability of each debtor corporation. The cross-collateralization agreements make each corporation's assets liable for the other's individual indebtedness.
[5]  Such is the implication of 11 U.S.C. § 23(i) [Bankruptcy Act § 5(i)] which provides that where only one partner is adjudged bankrupt, the partnership property shall not be administered unless by consent.

No. 03-40666.
United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit.
March 30, 2004.

Mitchel Neurock (argued), Laredo, TX, James Lee Turner, Asst. U.S. Atty., Houston, TX, for Plaintiff-Appellee.
Roland E. Dahlin, II, Fed. Pub. Def., Molly E. Odom (argued), Houston, TX, for Defendant-Appellant.
Appeal from the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas.
Before REAVLEY, DAVIS and DeMOSS, Circuit Judges.
REAVLEY, Circuit Judge:


1
Defendant Osvaldo Lopez-Coronado pleaded guilty to illegal re-entry in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a) but appeals the four level increase in his offense level at sentencing that counted his juvenile adjudications as felony convictions under the 2002 guidelines. We affirm. The defendant was fifteen years old in 1997 when the court found beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed the offenses of theft, unauthorized use of a vehicle, and possession of marijuana. He was adjudged a delinquent and sentenced to one year probation. The following year, he was again adjudged a delinquent because he was guilty of unauthorized use of a vehicle and evading arrest. The court made its findings beyond a reasonable doubt and again sentenced the defendant to one year probation. Under the sentencing guidelines, these offenses are considered felony offenses as they were punishable for a term of imprisonment exceeding one year. U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(o). In 2002, the defendant was deported and attempted to reenter the United States.


2
The guideline reads: "if the defendant previously was deported, or unlawfully remained in the United States, ** after ** a conviction for any other felony, increase [his base offense] by 4 levels." U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2(b)(1)(D). The sentencing commission did not limit this conviction to an adult conviction as it has elsewhere. See, e.g., U.S.S.G. § 2K1.3, cmt. n. 2 (determining the base offense level for unlawful receipt, possession or transportation of explosive materials using only adult convictions); U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1, cmt. n. 5 (determining the base offense level for unlawful receipt, possession or transportation of firearms or ammunition using only adult convictions).


3
Juvenile adjudications count as convictions for criminal history purposes. See U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(d)(2). This court has held a deferred adjudication under state law to be a conviction under § 2L1.2 where there was a finding beyond a reasonable doubt in a proceeding with adequate due process protections. United States v. Valdez-Valdez, 143 F.3d 196, 201 (5th Cir.1998). This defendant received those procedures and protections.


4
After the defendant was sentenced, the guideline was amended in this respect. After November 1, 2003, the commentary to Application Note 1(A)(iv) of § 2L1.2 provides: "Subsection (b)(1) does not apply to a conviction for an offense committed before the defendant was eighteen years of age unless such conviction is classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted." The amendment was not included in the list of amendments to be applied retroactively. U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10(a), (c) (2003). Only clarifying amendments to the guidelines are applied retroactively. See United States v. Davidson, 283 F.3d 681, 684-85 (5th Cir.2002). Because we read the 2002 guidelines as we do, the 2003 amendment was a substantive change and not a clarification.

Clarence ELSE, Guardian of Sim Cundiff, an Aged Person, and
Clarence Else, Guardian of Grace Cundiff, an Aged Person, Appellees,
v.
FREMONT METHODIST CHURCH of Fremont, Iowa, Appellant.
No. 48782.
Supreme Court of Iowa.
November 15, 1955.
*51 Ned P. Gilbert and Charles H. Scholz, Oskaloosa, for appellant.
Tunis H. Klein, Pella, and Bray, Carson & McCoy, Oskaloosa, for appellees.
LARSON, Justice.
This appeal involves an action in equity, brought by Clarence Else, guardian of Sim Cundiff and Grace Cundiff, against the defendant Fremont Methodist Church, wherein the guardian sought to have his wards' deed conveying a remainder interest in the wards' 134 acre farm to the defendant church, subject to a retained life estate in said wards, cancelled and set aside, and title to the property quieted in the wards as against the defendant, upon the grounds that (1) said wards were without sufficient mental capacity to execute said deed and (2) said deed was obtained from said wards by the exercise of undue influence by the pastor and the chairman of the board of trustees of said defendant church. The trial court found that the grantors lacked the requisite mental capacity and that their deed was obtained by the exercise of undue influence, and entered a decree for the plaintiffs. The defendant appealed.
The questions involved on this appeal are (1) whether the appellees satisfied the burden of establishing the claimed lack of mental capacity, (2) whether a confidential relationship existed of such nature as to cast upon the appellant any burden of proof with regard to the claim of undue influence, and if such burden was thereby cast upon the appellant, whether the appellant has met and satisfied that burden, and (3) whether any error was committed in excluding testimony of the grantors' attorney on the grounds of privilege.
Sim Cundiff and his wife Grace, the grantors of the deed in controversy, were 73 and 76 years of age, respectively, at the time of the execution of the deed. They had been married for 40 years, and no children were born as the issue of their marriage. Their only close relatives were Sim's one brother, and Grace's one sister. Sim had been a farmer all his life and he and Grace lived on and farmed a 120 acre farm located approximately two miles northwest of Fremont, Iowa. They also owned the real estate in controversy, said farm being triangular in shape with public highways constituting the north and east boundaries of the farm and a railroad right of way the southwest boundary thereof. In addition, they owned some livestock, farm machinery, bank accounts and government *52 bonds, having a total value of approximately $30,000.
Grace had been a member of defendant church many years, beginning with the time she was in high school and continuing until March 31, 1953, approximately six months after the deed in controversy was executed. She punctually attended church and was by her own statement a devout member. Sim Cundiff also attended this church, but did not become affiliated with it as a member until January 6, 1952.
Dr. Ernest A. Mathews, age 70, a Methodist Church minister since 1907, at the invitation of defendant church, came out of retirement and accepted a call as its supply pastor. He arrived in Fremont in June, 1951, and continued as such pastor until the summer of 1953. Upon arrival in Fremont, Dr. Mathews, seeking to become acquainted with his congregation, called at the Cundiff home in July, 1951, and became acquainted with Sim and Grace Cundiff. Thereafter until Sim sustained a cerebral hemorrhage on July 12, 1952, Dr. Mathews made further visits at the Cundiff home about once a month. A friendly relationship developed between them. On his second or third visit to the Cundiff home, in August or September, 1951, he had a conversation with Sim in the farmyard during which Sim said, without solicitation from Dr. Mathews: "I want to give $20,000 to the building of a new church and it must be on the highway." Dr. Mathews commented that the offer was a very wonderful thought for him to keep in mind, and thanked him.
In December, 1951, between Christmas and New Year's Day, Sim went to the bank with which he did business in Fremont and there delivered to his banker a check for $800 with the statement it was intended as a gift to the Fremont Methodist Church building fund, which check was subsequently turned over to the church treasurer. On Sunday, January 6, 1952, a ceremony for the reception of new members was conducted as part of the regular church service, at which time Sim received holy baptism and was received into the membership of the church. On this occasion Dr. Mathews made a public statement from the pulpit disclosing that a gift had been made to the building fund of the church by Mr. and Mrs. Cundiff. Without disclosing the exact amount, he stated that the gift was substantial. Soon after this Dr. Mathews and the church treasurer called at the Cundiff home to express the church's appreciation of the gift. On this occasion Sim stated the gift was "just a nest egg and he had another quarter." Dr. Mathews' public announcement was contrary to the Cundiff's desire to avoid publicity, and later on when the Cundiffs made a further gift of $400 to their church, they arranged that their tenant, Louis Meyers, mail his check for that amount to the church without any explanation that the Cundiffs were the actual donors, and for a time the church believed it was a gift from the tenant.
In the spring of 1952, following these gifts to the building fund, the church's trustees determined to canvass the church membership to ascertain whether there was any sentiment for the building of a new church building. In connection with this canvass, Dr. Mathews and W. O. McCurdy, chairman of the board of trustees of the church, stopped at the Cundiff home to interview Sim. Concerning this visit Grace testified: "S. E. was so concerned, he told them on this committee, `Let's build a church,'" but they informed him that the money wasn't available and the general congregation thought it wasn't feasible. Mrs. Cundiff also testified on one occasion during this period Sim said to her: "Grace, whenever we sell anything, if we have a little more than we need, we will put it on the building fund," and that there was similar talk for some months prior to the execution of the deed in controversy.
Later, on July 12, 1952, Sim suffered a cerebral hemorrhage which caused a partial paralysis of portions of his body and caused him to be confined to his bed for a period not definitely fixed by the Record. Sim's physical condition improved as time went on and he was able to sit in a wheel chair, and later on was able to get on his hands and knees and crawl, and still later on was able to walk about by leaning and *53 hanging on wires and other objects and without personal assistance from anyone. On September 28, 1952, four days after the deed was executed, Sim did walk from the barnyard to the house. Just before the deed was executed, he was able to be alone in the back yard of his home, exercising under the clothes line. Although his cerebral hemorrhage had affected his ability to talk plainly, he recognized his many visitors, was able to and did raise his hand in greeting, could answer questions by yes and no answers, and by signs and gestures was able to carry on conversations with his visitors and generally could make himself understood to them. His visitors included his neighbors, his farm tenants and their wives, several old family friends, his guardian, Clarence Else, and Mrs. Else, and Dr. Mathews, Mrs. Mathews, W. O. McCurdy, and W. O. McCurdy's daughter-in-law, Mildred McCurdy, most all of whom testified in this trial.
Mildred McCurdy, who moved to the Fremont community in 1949 upon her marriage to Leroy McCurdy, had never seen or heard of the Cundiffs until Sim's baptism on January 6, 1952, on which occasion Sim and Grace were identified as Mr. and Mrs. Cundiff. In March, 1952, she became personally acquainted with them. At Dr. Mathews' invitation she accompanied him and Mrs. Mathews to the Cundiff home for the purpose of playing her harp and singing religious hymns to Sim, she being an accomplished musician. Following this visit, Mildred's calls at the Cundiff home became more frequent and a closer friendship between Grace and Mildred developed after Sim's stroke, during the period from July 12 to September 24, 1952. Grace often called Mildred on the telephone urging her to come to their home, and she came to rely on Mildred to run errands for her, to bring her groceries from Fremont, and to do other similar favors for her.
During this same period Grace began to have difficulties with Sim's brother, Sam Cundiff. Sam's frequent visits to the Cundiff home disturbed and upset Sim, and Grace began to develop a feeling that Sam's motives were improper and he was endeavoring to become Sim's guardian. Sam's actions so dissatisfied her that on the evening of September 21, 1952, she sent her handyman, Archie Fuller, to Fremont to seek out Mildred McCurdy for the purpose of soliciting her aid. Mildred informed Fuller that she was a short-time resident of Iowa, she was not familiar with the Iowa laws, and she therefore did not feel competent to advise or assist Grace. Later on that same evening she received a telephone call from Fuller from his home in Ottumwa. In this call he informed Mildred that he had stopped at the sheriff's office in Ottumwa to discuss the situation and had been advised by the sheriff it was a matter for the Mahaska County authorities, and Grace should seek the aid and assistance of the Mahaska County Attorney, Garold Heslinga. He also stated that the sheriff had suggested it would be well to check into Grace's mental condition. On the following morning, Monday, September 22nd, Mildred drove to the Cundiff home and informed Grace of Mr. Fuller's message and the procedure suggested by him. Grace then decided she would go to Oskaloosa where she would see and consult Dr. Voigt, who was the family physician and who then had Sim under his care, relative to her own mental condition and would seek the aid and assistance of Heslinga. She requested that Mildred take her there for those purposes. They departed for Oskaloosa about 10 o'clock and arrived at Oskaloosa around 11 o'clock that same morning, with W. O. McCurdy, Mildred's father-in-law, furnishing the transportation in his car. On the way to Oskaloosa Grace expressed a desire to avoid climbing any steps to the second story office of the county attorney and suggested she would like to have W. O. McCurdy contact the county attorney and make an appointment to meet her at Dr. Voigt's office. Upon arrival at Dr. Voigt's office Mildred, Grace, and W. O. McCurdy, ascertained that Dr. Voigt would be unable to see them until 12:30 P.M. Thereupon Mildred and Grace left the office and went to a restaurant and ate lunch. Mr. McCurdy proceeded to Heslinga's office where he made arrangements to have Heslinga meet *54 Mrs. Cundiff at Dr. Voigt's office at the appointed hour of 12:30 P.M. At that time Heslinga came to the doctor's office and found Mildred, W. O., and Grace in the waiting room. He visited with them briefly, at which time Grace informed him of her difficulties with Sam and her desire for Heslinga's assistance. In their discussion Heslinga alluded to the fact that Sam Cundiff was Sim's sole heir-at-law and inquired whether any arrangements had been made concerning the devolution of their property in the event of their deaths. Grace informed Heslinga that she and Sim owned all of their property in joint tenancy and that provisions had been made whereby the survivor of Grace and Sim would acquire all of the property. Heslinga then inquired as to whether provisions had been made as to who should succeed to the property upon the death of both of them. Upon being informed by Grace that no such provision had been made, Heslinga suggested that immediate arrangements should be made by Grace and Sim to plan their estates and in connection therewith to execute suitable wills. Grace agreed to this procedure and thereupon she, Heslinga, W. O., and Mildred proceeded into the doctor's conference room, where Grace's difficulties with Sam Cundiff were again explained and the doctor was requested to express an opinion as to Grace's mental condition, and also as to her and Sim's testamentary capacity. Dr. Voigt interrogated Grace at length concerning the members of her family, her relatives and the extent of her property, and in the presence of all four then stated he was of the opinion Grace was of sound mind, she had testamentary capacity, and knew what she was doing and the consequences of her acts. Later he signed and delivered to Heslinga a similar statement of his opinion concerning Grace's testamentary capacity. He also expressed an opinion that Sim Cundiff was then of sound mind and had testamentary capacity.
The four then retired from Dr. Voigt's office and proceeded to the parked McCurdy automobile. Mildred McCurdy departed on a shopping errand, leaving Heslinga, Grace Cundiff and W. O. McCurdy seated in the car. Heslinga and Grace conversed at length concerning the provisions of Grace and Sim's proposed wills, and Heslinga made notes. It appears that he then informed Grace he would prepare the requested wills, and made an appointment to meet Grace and Sim at the Cundiff home at 10 o'clock the following morning, September 23, 1952, to execute their wills. On the way home Grace told Mildred they were going to will 50% of their property to the Fremont Methodist Church.
Heslinga prepared wills for Sim and Grace, and on the following morning, September 23, 1952, he drove to Fremont in his car, where he contacted W. O. McCurdy and W. O.'s son, James McCurdy, and made arrangements for them to accompany him to the Cundiff home for the purpose of witnessing the execution of Grace and Sim Cundiff's wills. This same morning Grace Cundiff told Mrs. Clarence Else, wife of the plaintiff guardian, she was making plans to execute her will and she desired to appoint Mrs. Else's husband Clarence as administrator of her estate. By the time Heslinga and W. O. and James McCurdy reached the Cundiff home that morning Clarence Else had responded to Mrs. Cundiff's message by coming to the house. Else and Louis Meyers, the farm tenant, were at the Cundiff home when Heslinga and the two McCurdys arrived. Heslinga went into the house and there had a conversation with Meyers and Else in which he informed them he had business to transact with the Cundiffs concerning their estate and requested them to leave. Else and Meyers then went outdoors and visited with the two McCurdy men while Heslinga conversed with the Cundiffs in the house. Upon retiring from the house Heslinga informed Else that Sim and Grace had not executed the wills he had brought with him, and there were certain changes to be made. Heslinga and the two McCurdy men then left in Heslinga's car, and he returned to his law office in Oskaloosa where he prepared new wills *55 incorporating the additional provisions and names of beneficiaries the Cundiffs desired named in their wills.
On the following morning, September 24, 1952, Heslinga again drove to Fremont in his car, picked up W. O. and James McCurdy as witnesses, and went to the Cundiff home for the purpose of having the Cundiff wills executed. Grace's will was read aloud and she then executed it and it was witnessed by the two McCurdy men. The prepared draft of Sim's will, Exhibit D-4, the provisions of which were similar to the will signed by Grace, was then read to Sim down to and including paragraph 3 thereof. At that point Sim indicated his dissatisfaction with its terms and pushed the will aside. He then indicated by sound and motion his desire to obtain some object lying upon the kitchen table, which was a piece of paper then on the table. This piece of paper was cut in a triangular shape. Those present endeavored to ascertain Sim's desires and the meaning of the paper. After extended questioning in which Sim could not make himself understood, Sim got out of his wheel chair, down onto the floor and grabbing the leg of Heslinga's trousers and crawling on his hands and knees led Heslinga, Grace and the others, outdoors to Heslinga's car, and by motions indicated his desire to take a ride. They got into the car and Heslinga drove the car in the direction indicated by Sim. He directed them south along the highway, past the crossroads to the railroad crossing at the southeast corner of the tenant farm, then back to the crossroads and west to the tenant house. They then proceeded west in the car to the railroad crossing at the northwest corner of the farm, then turned around and returned to the crossroads and then north to the Cundiff home. Upon their return Mrs. Cundiff suggested to all of them that the paper was in the shape of the tenant farm and perhaps it was intended to represent the farm. Heslinga then inquired of Sim whether he was trying to tell him something about the farm, and Sim, by word and by motion of his head, indicated he was. Then, through questions propounded by Heslinga and answers made by Sim, Sim indicated he wished to make a gift of the farm to the church, not by a will, but by a deed in which a life estate was to be retained by Sim and Grace. Heslinga explained the tax problems involved in such a transaction and the legal implications of a will as distinguished from a deed to be presently delivered. Heslinga told Mrs. Cundiff and Sim that a will could always be torn up and revoked but that a deed was final and could never be changed or revoked.
Informing the Cundiffs that he would prepare such a deed and return to their home later on that day for its execution, Heslinga, W. O. and James McCurdy returned to Fremont. Heslinga obtained a blank deed form and a plat book from the Fremont Bank and after determining the correct legal description of the real estate involved, he prepared the deed on a borrowed typewriter. He ate his lunch alone at a cafe in Fremont and then returned to the Cundiff home. W. O. McCurdy again went with him.
It appears during Heslinga's absence Grace Cundiff telephoned Mrs. Mathews and said to her: "I've a very happy surprise for you and Dr. Mathews. I want you to come right on out to our place." Dr. and Mrs. Mathews responded to this request by immediately driving out to the Cundiff home in their automobile. Upon their arrival at the Cundiff home Grace did not immediately reveal to them the plan to make a gift of the farm to the church. When Heslinga arrived, he informed Dr. Mathews he had some business to transact with the Cundiffs which concerned the church and he did not wish them to be present. Grace then joined Heslinga and Sim in the back yard while Dr. and Mrs. Mathews remained in the front yard and W. O. McCurdy went to the porch of the house. Heslinga then read the deed in full, including the acknowledgment certificate, to Grace and Sim. The deed was then executed by Grace and Sim, and Heslinga completed the acknowledgment form in his capacity as a notary public. Heslinga then called Dr. and Mrs. Mathews and W. O. McCurdy into the back yard and there, in *56 the presence of Sim and Grace, informed all those present that Sim and Grace had just made a gift of their tenant farm to the church, by deeding it to the church. The deed was then handed by Heslinga to W. O. McCurdy. W. O. McCurdy and Dr. Mathews, on behalf of the church, expressed their very great appreciation for the gift and Dr. Mathews offered prayer in thanks. McCurdy then handed the deed to Heslinga and instructed him to take it to Oskaloosa to be recorded. There is a dispute as to whether Sim or Grace voiced or indicated any objection to the recording or publishing of the deed. However, the following day Mr. Heslinga did send the deed to the Mahaska County Recorder for recording.
Upon being informed that his bill was $13.00, Grace prepared a check in that amount and handed it to Heslinga before he left for Oskaloosa. No one else paid Heslinga for these services. It further appears that Heslinga at no time ever represented or acted as attorney for the Fremont Methodist Church, Dr. Mathews, any of the McCurdys or the partnership which is known as the McCurdy Seed Company.
On the day after the execution of the deed, September 25th, Mildred McCurdy was at the Cundiff home and Mrs. Cundiff told her: "We deeded this other farm to the Church. It was all Sim's idea." At that time she showed Mildred the triangular piece of paper, and told her Sim had cut it out.
A birthday-wedding anniversary party was held at the Cundiff home on September 28th. Subsequent to that date, and on September 30th, the Oskaloosa Herald published a list of all deeds which had been recorded recently in the County Recorder's office, including the Cundiff deed to defendant church. Prior thereto Grace told Louis Meyers, their tenant, about the execution of the deed, but at the party there was no reference to the execution of the deed and no complaint was made concerning its execution.
It was following the recording of the deed and talks with various persons that Grace made complaint concerning its execution and delivery. The minister first heard of this change of heart when she called him on the telephone and threatened to "close the doors of the Church" unless they returned the conveyance. Thereafter Louis Meyers took Grace to Heslinga's office to solicit his aid in helping her obtain the return of the deed, and when he declined to help her, Meyers took her to the office of another lawyer, John Sproatt, to consult with him concerning the deed.
There is little controversy in the case as to the applicable law, and the correct result rests largely upon an accurate determination and application of the facts involved.
I. One of appellant's contentions is that the trial court erred in finding from the disclosed facts that a confidential relationship existed between Dr. Mathews and W. O. McCurdy, chairman of the church board of trustees, on one hand, and Sim and Grace Cundiff on the other hand, thereby putting the burden upon appellant to justify the deed. As usual in cases of this nature this question lies at the threshold of a proper determination of the lawsuit. The record, as voluminous as it is, contains little direct evidence bearing on the subject. True, there was the relationship of clergyman and parishioner, but it is well settled that such relationship alone is not conclusive of a confidential relationship. Coughlin v. St. Patrick's Church, 201 Iowa 1268, 203 N.W. 812; Humphrey v. Norwood, 213 Iowa 912, 918, 240 N.W. 232; Roller v. Roller, 201 Iowa 1077, 1082, 203 N.W. 41; Stonewall v. Danielson, 204 Iowa 1367, 1370, 217 N.W. 456; O'Neil v. Morrison, 211 Iowa 416, 233 N.W. 708. Indeed few relationships in name only do carry such import, but the true test has been set forth in several of our cases and reaffirmed as late as our past session. See Dibel v. Meredith, 233 Iowa 545, 549, 10 N.W.2d 28; Merritt v. Easterly, 226 Iowa 514, 284 N.W. 397; Knigge v. Dencker, Iowa, 72 N.W.2d 494. The object back of the rule is to prevent one standing *57 in a confidential relationship with another from gaining an advantage in a transaction with the cestui que trust, which may reasonably be the result of the confidence reposed. Thus before one is allowed to retain the advantages of the transaction, he must show that the cestui acted with freedom, intelligence, and full knowledge of all the facts. Utterback v. Hollingsworth, 208 Iowa 300, 225 N.W. 419, and cases cited therein.
Usually the burden is on one seeking to set aside a deed upon the grounds of mental incapacity and undue influence such as we have here, and he is required to prove the allegations, not by a mere preponderance of the evidence, but by clear, satisfactory and convincing evidence. Merritt v. Easterly, supra, 226 Iowa 514, 516, 284 N.W. 397; Crawford v. Raible, 206 Iowa 732, 745, 221 N.W. 474; Foster v. Foster, 223 Iowa 455, 457, 273 N.W. 165. It should therefore be necessary for one alleging a confidential relationship so as to raise a presumption that transactions between the parties are improper or fraudulent, and shift the burden of proving that the cestui acted freely and with full knowledge of all the facts, to prove that relationship in a clear and convincing manner. Popejoy v. Eastburn, 241 Iowa 747, 757, 41 N.W.2d 764. Some little confusion has resulted in the consideration of most any friendly relationship as a showing of confidential relationship, but far more is necessary. Evidence must be produced to show how and in what manner the alleged trust was reposed, and how the dominance was exercised. The facts giving rise to the relationship, the showing that the one party was actually in a position of dominance or superiority, and the cestui in a corresponding position of inferiority or subservience, the strength of will of one and weakness of the other, the intimate character of their relation, and the facts showing the manner in which trusts and confidences had been reposed in the dominant party, must appear. In other words, this relationship should be clearly shown and not left to conjecture.
We think here the trial court fell into error by assuming, because of the religious nature of the relationship, it was a confidential relationship. This may be a considered factor but is far from conclusive and the ultimate confidential relationship presumed. The trusts, confidences, reliance, dominance, and subversion must be shown. Judge Mantz, speaking for our court in Dibel v. Meredith, supra, 233 Iowa at page 551, 10 N.W.2d at page 31, clarified the meaning of confidential relationship as follows:
"It was the holding in the cited case [Merritt v. Easterly] based upon authority that a confidential relationship arises where one person gains the confidence of another and purports to act and advise with the other's interest in mind."
He also had this to say in the same case, 233 Iowa at page 549, 10 N.W.2d at page 30:
"A confidential relationship arises whenever a continuous trust is reposed by one person in the skill and integrity of another, and so it has been said that all the variety of relations in which dominion may be exercised by one person fall within the general term `confidential relation'." Citing 15 C.J.S., Confidential, p. 822; Pomeroy's Equity Jurisprudence, 3d Ed., section 956.
Judge Bliss further pointed out in the case of Merritt v. Easterly, supra, 226 Iowa 514, 284 N.W. 397, some of the acts and circumstances under which a presumption of confidential relationship properly exists. From a careful reading of that case it is quite evident the defendant here was not shown exercising such a dominance or relationship toward the grantors. In that case the grantee took a deed from the grantor on March 3, 1937, which was alleged to be a gift. In November, 1935, grantee had moved in grantor's home and thereafter took complete charge of her affairs and attended to every detail. He took charge of her bank account and check book, made all deposits and withdrawals. The evidence disclosed he did many other things purportedly with her "interest in mind." It *58 was pointed out therein this court had no intention of fettering the operation of the principles which have been consistently followed by this and other courts in cases involving the correct and just presumption arising from confidential relationships by undertaking to define the term or give the precise limits thereof. Nevertheless we find therein an excellent discussion of the subject and a rather clear explanation of the elements required to be proven to establish this relationship. It is just and proper to so protect weak, incompetent and trusting persons from the fraudulent efforts of unscrupulous persons, but it is also necessary, we think, to show first how and in what manner that trust was reposed and how the dominance was exercised. In that respect the plaintiffs here have utterly failed.
Except for the opportunity to exercise these influences, the evidence discloses no such relationship. We cannot say the usual pastoral visits at the Cundiff home by the minister and his wife, or an occasional call by the chairman of the church board of trustees, who was also the lay leader of this little 100-member church, especially after Sim's illness, can give rise to such an inference. There was no showing these men ever told the Cundiffs what to do, nor were they consulted about any business matters. It is true Mrs. Cundiff said, in answer to a leading question, they consulted about religious and business matters. Her testimony was as follows:
"Q. Did you place trust and confidence in Mr. Mathews? A. Yes, sir. We sure did.
"Q. Also Mr. McCurdy? A. We sure did. I thought he was a Christian man.
* * * "Q. Did they discuss religious matters with you? A. Oh, yes.
"Q. And some business matters? A. Yes. But I didn't always know about that, that would be in the back yard."
But no further details were related. These were important, if true, to establish the alleged relationship, and without evidence thereof, it is of little value to the court.
It is most difficult to find any evidence of the demands or dominance of this minister or Mr. McCurdy, or the subservience of the Cundiffs. They handled no business matters for the Cundiffs and, except for pleasant social relations, we find no evidence of dependence upon them. As a matter of fact, the Cundiffs seemed to be the ones who did the demanding, and these church people, including the daughter-in-law of Mr. McCurdy, a talented musician, and other neighbors and friends, went out of their way to be kind to them and do acts of servitude, especially after Sim's illness. See O'Neil v. Morrison, supra, 211 Iowa 416, 233 N.W. 708.
The fact that McCurdy and his daughter-in-law provided transportation to Oskaloosa on September 22nd at the request of Mrs. Cundiff, does not infer a relationship of dominance over her or her husband. There is nothing at all in this record to show the grantors reposed any special faith and confidence in any suggestions of McCurdy or the minister, certainly not to the extent that they sacrificed their own ideas to those of the church officers. Indeed the evidence disclosed complete independent thinking for themselves, for Mrs. Cundiff wanted a will drawn to her liking, and Mr. Cundiff did not want a will but a deed to his liking. Not once does it appear that the minister or McCurdy offered even a suggestion, to say nothing of a demand for a deed or specific provision or a bequest in the wills for the benefit of the church. We cannot infer from their opportunity or even their disposition to do so that they did so, and thus relieve the parties who would set aside the deed from proving by clear, satisfactory and convincing evidence that its execution and delivery was obtained by undue influence, fraud, or due to the mental incompetency of the grantors. Their relationship was not shown to be any more pronounced than that of many other friends and neighbors who frequently came in to assist at the time of Mr. Cundiff's illness and convalescence. We conclude therefore plaintiffs have failed to prove the alleged trust, confidence, *59 reliance or dominance required to establish the confidential relationship alleged.
II. The trial court found the defendant did not sustain the burden of proof imposed by law on it to show no unfair advantage was taken of the Cundiffs in the transaction. This conclusion, due to our difference with the trial court in Division I hereof, is therefore also in error. It was not defendant's burden, for we determined the alleged confidential relationship had not been established. Therefore, the burden remained the plaintiffs' to prove undue influence by clear, satisfactory and convincing evidence. Merritt v. Easterly, supra, 226 Iowa 514, 516, 284 N.W. 397; Mastain v. Butschy, 224 Iowa 68, 84, 276 N.W. 79. The expression of this court found in In re Estate of Mott, 200 Iowa 948, 205 N. W. 770, approved in Worth v. Pierson, 208 Iowa 353, 223 N.W. 752, and Arndt v. Lapel, 214 Iowa 594, 603, 243 N.W. 605, 609, is as follows:
"`"Influence, to be undue, within the meaning of the law, must be such as to substitute the will of the person exercising the influence for that of the testator, thereby making the writing express, not the purpose and intent of the testator, but that of the person exercising the undue influence. It must be equivalent to moral coercion, must operate at the very time the will is made, and must dominate and control the making of it. [Citing many cases.] * * * Undue influence is not established by proof of opportunity to exercise it. Importunity, request, and persuasion that do not go to the point of controlling the will of the testator are not enough, nor is it established by proof of opportunity and disposition so to do. [Citing cases.] * * * Contestants must go further than this, and show not only the existence of the facts, but that said undue influence existed, and controlled the maker of the instrument in the disposition he made of his property, substituting the will of the person exercising the influence for the will of the person making the writing."'"
Also see Knigge v. Dencker, recently handed down by this court and written by Justice Thompson, Iowa, 72 N.W.2d 494, and cases cited therein.
As to the law of undue influence, little further need be said. Relationship of the parties, improvidence of the gift, activities of beneficiaries, and weakened mental condition might under some circumstances become important. It is manifest to us that under the record these elements did not control, and what we said as to the failure to prove facts that would give rise to a confidential relationship also applies here. See Osborn v. Fry, 202 Iowa 129, 209 N.W. 303; Humphrey v. Norwood, supra, 213 Iowa 912, 918, 240 N.W. 232. Although the burden of proof was not upon it, we think defendant has shown good faith in its relationship with the Cundiffs. There is no showing it interfered or tried to interfere with the wishes or decisions of either Grace or Sim Cundiff.
It will be recalled Grace gave detailed instructions as to how she wished her will drawn and the attorney took notes on two occasions in order to incorporate therein the specific bequests desired by her. There is no contention McCurdy, who was present the first time, made even a suggestion. It was her desire that both prepared wills, hers and Sim's, provide that 50% of the balance left after both were deceased should go to the church building fund. There is no contention that after her will was so prepared she did not sign it in the presence of witnesses, or that Sim did not refuse to sign his will, and in doing so indicated he had other ideas about the tenant farm. When questioned by their attorney at that time, it developed Sim wished to deed that farm to the church rather than will 50% of all their remainder. When the legal implications of such a transfer were explained to him by the attorney, in her presence and in the presence of others, Sim signified that was his desire, and the deed was prepared. Rather than a straight deed, it provided for a life estate in Sim and Grace Cundiff and was executed and delivered in the afternoon of September 24, 1952.
We have carefully reviewed the record and find nowhere even the slightest indication *60 that the will of either the minister or the board chairman was substituted for that of Sim or Grace Cundiff. As heretofore pointed out, if kindness or willingness to help these good people could supply that fact, then all the neighbors thereabout, including their tenants and their present guardian, must be viewed with suspicion, for they also called on the Cundiffs frequently after Sim's stroke and offered help and assistance. No doubt there was a feeling of gratitude toward all these people by the Cundiffs, but clearly we cannot infer thereby a dominance over Sim and Grace. They too, or most of them, were listed as beneficiaries under the prepared wills. But as previously pointed out, even if all these parties had tried to persuade the action of the Cundiffs, that would not have been sufficient, for the law requires a clear and convincing showing that the grantor's will was not his own but that of the party benefited by the instrument, to constitute the exercise of undue influence. Clearly then, the fact that several months before the illness of Sim, the minister and the board chairman had stopped to solicit church funds and report on a canvass to determine the feasibility of a church building program, did not furnish the basis of a superimposed will causing the execution of the deed.
True, there was no consideration for the deed, but clearly none was intended, for it was a gift in contemplation of death. It can scarcely be called an improvident gift, for besides having the life use of the property, the Cundiffs still had a farm of about the same size and about $30,000 in cash and bonds. They had no children, and there were only a brother of Sim's, whom Grace did not like but feared, and a sister of Grace's, who seemed to be of no interest to Grace.
As a matter of fact, it rather clearly appears the Cundiffs wished to do for the church. They had, before Sim's illness, given $800 at one time and $400 at another through a tenant. They wanted a new church built. Defendant contends, with some merit, it was the publicity they received due to the recording of the deed that caused the trouble. Whether it was that or the comments of their neighbors, it is evident they did change their minds. Even though they were warned by their lawyer at the time of the execution as to the import of a deed, they nevertheless now apparently wish to otherwise dispose of that property. Mrs. Cundiff testified that when she signed the deed, she knew it was a deed, and that before she signed it Heslinga said: "Mrs. Cundiff, if you sign a will, you can just tear it up, but you couldn't do a deed that way," and "Mrs. Cundiff, after you sign a will, you can have it changed, but you can't do a deed that way." She also testified that the deed "was Sim's idea" and that she signed it to please Sim. It is now too late to change their minds, for deeds may not be so easily upset. It was grantors' desire then, and if either of them thereafter became unsound of mind, who can say their desire thereafter is the right one? Sim suffered with arteriosclerosis, and how far that malady had developed does not appear. It is well known that it is a progressive disease and it is quite possible that he soon thereafter reached the stage where his mind was unsound. Clearly after that his will could not be determined.
We find support for this conclusion in Leonard v. Leonard, 234 Iowa 421, 428, 12 N.W.2d 899, 902, where we said:
"In order to set aside a deed such as the one in the present case the burden is upon the plaintiff to establish by clear, satisfactory and convincing testimony that the grantor at the time he signed it did not understand in any reasonable manner the nature of the particular transaction in which he was engaged and the consequences and effects upon his rights and interests. Foster v. Foster, 223 Iowa 455, 273 N.W. 165, and cases cited; * * *. The courts have uniformly upheld the right of every person to dispose of his property freely and in accordance with his wishes and have refused to permit such right to be disturbed without strong proof. * * * Our decisions uniformly hold that to set aside an instrument on the *61 ground of undue influence there must be such persuasion as results in overpowering the will of a person or prevents him from acting intelligently, understandingly and voluntarilysuch influence as destroys the free agency of the grantor and substitutes the will of another person for his own." Citing Osborn v. Fry, 202 Iowa 129, 209 N.W. 303, and Gates v. Cole, 137 Iowa 613, 115 N.W. 236.
Only by sheer conjecture could it be found here there existed any basis for a finding that the will of the grantor had been superimposed for nowhere do we find any testimony that anyone suggested that the Cundiffs deed the triangular or tenant farm to the church. Mrs. Cundiff herself said it was all Sim's idea.
Then too, undue influence must operate at the very time the instrument is executed. In re Estate of Brooks, 229 Iowa 485, 493, 294 N.W. 735; In re Estate of Eiker, 233 Iowa 315, 317, 6 N.W.2d 318. The rule was well announced in In re Estate of Hollis, 324 Iowa 761, 769, 12 N.W. 2d 576, 581, where we said:
"Undue influence, although of course it may be proven by circumstantial evidence, must be such as to substitute the will of the person exercising it for that of the testator, thereby making the writing express the purpose and intent of such person, not of the testator. It must be equivalent to moral coercion. It must operate at the very time the will is made and dominate and control its making. It is not established by proof of opportunity and disposition to exercise it. Importunity, request and persuasion that do not control the will are not enough." (Citing cases.)
Also see Campbell v. Hale, 233 Iowa 264, 6 N.W.2d 128, for effect of available opportunity for independent advice.
It is interesting to note, in regard to Grace Cundiff's declarations as to her intent on the execution of the deed, this pronouncement in In re Estate of Eiker, supra, at page 317 of 233 Iowa, at page 320 of 6 N.W.2d:
"We have uniformly held that the fact of the exercise of undue influence cannot be established by proof of declarations of the testator made before or after the execution of the will, such declarations not being substantive evidence of undue influence. There must be some substantive evidence of the exercise of undue influence before declarations may be considered."
Reasonable limits of an opinion do not permit a discussion of all the contentions relating to undue influence. However, we conclude there was insufficient clear, satisfactory, and convincing proof of undue influence exercised by defendant in procuring the deed.
III. Perhaps plaintiffs' principal contention is that both Sim Cundiff and his wife Grace did not have mental capacity to execute the deed, and did not know or realize the import of their act. Such contention likewise demands of plaintiffs clear, satisfactory, and convincing evidence. We find no merit in the contention as to Grace Cundiff. The most persuasive evidence produced as to her mental capacity was from her own doctor, Dr. Voigt, who said, after an examination of her two days before the deed was signed, that she was mentally competent to execute such instruments. Grace said she was nervous, distracted and mentally disturbed due to Sim's illness, and though she knew she was signing a deed, and its import, she was doing it to humor Sim and did not think it would amount to any actual transfer. Several friends and neighbors testified she appeared distraught and mentally disturbed after Sim's illness, but none said she was of unsound mind. Mere mental weakness in a grantor is not grounds to invalidate a deed. In Nowlen v. Nowlen, 122 Iowa 541, 546, 98 N.W. 383, 384, we said:
"Mere mental weakness in a grantor will not invalidate a deed. To have that effect, the mental powers must be so far deteriorated or destroyed that the grantor is incapable of understanding in a reasonable *62 degree the nature and consequences of the instrument he executes."
Also see Paulus v. Reed, 121 Iowa 224, 96 N.W. 757; Gernhart v. Gernhart, 194 Iowa 487, 185 N.W. 483.
Plaintiffs' witnesses said Grace was "worked up like anyone would be," and "Grace appeared to be very distraught and worked up" due to Sim's stroke and physical disability. Dr. McNichols, called by plaintiffs, did not express an opinion as to her mental soundness. We think there is no question that she had the mental capacity to execute the deed on September 24, 1952, knew exactly what she was doing, and knew the consequences of the act. She said she knew it was a deed, but thought it was all being done to please Sim and therefore meant nothing; in other words, was all a hoax upon her unfortunate spouse. We doubt that story.
As to Sim the evidence, though somewhat stronger, is still insufficient to satisfy us he was of unsound mind or did not know what he was doing on the date the deed was executed, or that he did not have the ability to comprehend and understand the nature of his act and its consequences. See 26 C.J.S., Deeds, § 54, page 264, note 95. Mere weakness of mind, or periods of unsoundness of mind in or about that time, are not sufficient proof of mental incapacity to execute a deed if at the time of its execution it clearly appears one has the capacity to comprehend and understand the nature of his act and its consequences. Nowlen v. Nowlen, supra; Altig v. Altig, 137 Iowa 420, 423, 114 N.W. 1056; Cavanagh v. O'Connor, 186 Iowa 257, 264, 169 N.W. 747; Coughlin v. St. Patrick's Church, supra; Leonard v. Leonard, supra; Keune v. McCauley, 228 Iowa 607, 609, 293 N. W. 25.
Here too plaintiffs offered no testimony as to Sim's actual mental condition on the day the deed was executed. An expert witness, Dr. McNichols, produced by plaintiffs, freely admitted that one suffering from the ailment such as Sim had, might possibly have subsequent sane or lucid intervals, though a permanent recovery was not possible. It is true Dr. Campbell, a physician who examined him some months later, found him to be of unsound mind, and said in his opinion that condition existed at the time of the conveyance. But on the other hand, Dr. McNichols, who attended Sim at the time of the stroke in July, 1952, said it was not too severe and he would improve both physically and mentally sixty or ninety days thereafter. On the day of the stroke Dr. McNichols considered him of unsound mind, but did not examine him thereafter and did not know whether he was of sound or unsound mind on September 24, 1952. However, from his experience with like cases, the greater percentage of cases did not result in the patient's loss of a sound mind. "They are of sound mind following a stroke such as Sim Cundiff sustained," he said.
There was the usual testimony of nonexperts as to Sim's mind, and the tenor of those opinions was that, although he knew and recognized them, because he had a blank expression on his face, could only talk or make himself understood with difficulty, mostly answering questions with yes or no, could walk very little and did not show too much interest in things about him, he was of unsound mind, at least at times; also that he was forgetful. They are not very helpful, nor are the facts upon which these witnesses based their opinions as to Sim's mental soundness. See Olson v. Olson, 242 Iowa 192, 204, 46 N.W.2d 1, 40 A.L.R.2d 1. None testified as to the state of his mind on September 24, 1952, the day the instrument was signed. On the other hand, Dr. Voigt, Sim's physician of several years past, expressed the opinion to the Cundiffs' attorney, Mr. Heslinga, two days before the deed was signed that he thought Sim of sound mind and able to execute a legal document.
The undisputed testimony that Sim rejected the will Grace had drawn for him and in a rather ingenious manner indicated the land he wished to deed to the church instead, and the answers given to Attorney Heslinga when he inquired as to Sim's desire, seems to lead to the conclusion he did at that time have the capacity to comprehend *63 and to understand the nature of his act and its consequences. Even Grace said "It was all Sim's idea." As a matter of fact it was a gift which probably would be less than 50% of the remainder after Grace and Sim died, and reasonably could be expected to result in lower court costs in realization. It disclosed a rational decision, if they desired to give a substantial gift to the church.
We fail to find in these undenied transactions any clear or convincing evidence of undue influence or mental incapacity of either party, and therefore plaintiffs' contentions that such existed at or near the time of the deed's execution must fail.
It may be conceded that weakened mental condition such as Sim Cundiff suffered is a factor to be considered, but here he was attended by his wife Grace and his attorney Heslinga, and only by them at the time of the execution of the deed. It must be concluded they would not have permitted him to sign the deed if they had not been convinced he knew what he wanted, what he was doing. They were his helpers and were in a position to give him independent advice or the guidance he might desire. Merritt v. Easterly, supra, at page 528 of 226 Iowa, at page 404 of 284 N.W. Even from plaintiffs evidence it satisfactorily appears that on September 24, 1952, the grantors intended the deed to the land in controversy should be delivered to defendant herein. It would unduly extend this opinion, already too long, to comment at length upon all the testimony and conflicting evidence on Sim's mental soundness, so we say upon the whole record plaintiffs have failed to show by clear, satisfactory, and convincing evidence that Sim or Grace were so mentally incompetent at the time the deed was made that they did not know what they were doing or understand the consequences of their act.
We are supported by a host of cases, among which are: Merritt v. Easterly, supra, 226 Iowa 514, 516, 284 N.W. 397; Crawford v. Raible, supra, 206 Iowa 732, 745, 221 N.W. 474; Keating v. Augustine, 213 Iowa 1336, 1347, 241 N.W. 429; Foster v. Foster, supra, 223 Iowa 455, 457, 273 N.W. 165. Furthermore there is a strong presumption in favor of the grantors' mental competency. Evers v. Webb, 186 Iowa 1172, 1178, 173 N.W. 264; Wilson v. Wilson, 240 Iowa 26, 34 N.W. 2d 911.
In Coughlin v. St. Patrick's Church, supra, 201 Iowa 1268, 1280, 203 N.W. 812, we said:
"While the case is close on the fact question of mental competency,more so than on the question of undue influence, we are of the opinion that, at the time of the execution of the conveyances, the grantor was possessed of such mental capacity as enabled him, in law, to execute the deeds in question."
Perhaps the most significant fact on the issue of mental capacity is the apparent willingness of Grace to permit Sim to sign the deed and to join him in doing so, and the fact that Sim's own attorney, Garold Heslinga, permitted him to execute the deed after consulting with Sim's own physician, Dr. Voigt, relative to Grace and Sim's mental condition. These facts are quite persuasive of the regularity of this transaction.
IV. In arriving at a conclusion different from that of the trial court, we are aware that we have said many times we give serious consideration to the findings of that court because it saw and heard the witnesses. However, we are not bound by its finding, especially in matters like the one at hand where the law is not in dispute and the witnesses who testified to various facts were apparently attempting to tell the truth. There appears to be no serious question of credibility or veracity which should be left to the trial court's better determination. We must, we think, determine for ourselves whether the case has been established by clear, satisfactory, and convincing evidence. Of course this matter is reviewable de novo. Peddicord v. Peddicord, 242 Iowa 555, 47 N.W.2d 264.
It is here not a question whether these witnesses have an honest and abiding convictim *64 as to their expressed opinions on the mental capacity of the parties, but whether the facts they relate are sufficient to support such opinions and convince the court of their correctness. Those opinions are not controlling. They did not refer to the time the deed was made, and some of them did not express the belief Sim was at all times unable to know what he was doing or what was going on. Quite the contrary, he knew most of them at all times and conversed with them the best he could with his speech defect. We attach little significance to the fact he sometimes tried to put a lighted end of a cigar in his mouth, and on one occasion started to wash his feet with his socks on. Many sane old men are just that forgetful. At the most these incidents could disclose only a weakness of mind and body or a forgetfulness common to people of his age, and not a condition which disclosed an inability to know or understand the nature of his acts and their consequences.
We must therefore differ with the conclusions of the able trial court in this matter.
V. We should not conclude this opinion without some comment upon the unfortunate reflection cast upon Mr. Heslinga, the attorney who was drawn into this controversy by being employed by Mrs. Cundiff. We are convinced he served only the Cundiffs. They alone paid him for his services. As the attorney for the Cundiffs we are convinced he furnished them independent, good, and correct legal advice, and nothing is shown to substantiate a charge that he conspired to aid the church obtain the deed in controversy. He received only $13 for his services, which consisted of a conference in Oskaloosa and two trips to the Cundiff home near Fremont, plus the preparation of four wills and a deed. The only possible mistake he made was to assume the Cundiffs wanted their friend Mr. McCurdy as a witness to the wills and took him and his son along for that purpose. However, there is not the slightest indication he was acting for the minister, Mr. McCurdy, or anyone but the Cundiffs. It is suggested the neighbors could have been used as witnesses, but it does not appear the attorney personally knew them or that they may have been desired by the Cundiffs.
VI. Defendant's counterclaim, which prayed that its title to the real estate be quieted subject only to the life estate of Sim and Grace Cundiff, should be upheld. The trial court's dismissal of the counterclaim, as well as its cancellation of the deed, must therefore be reversed.
Reversed and remanded for decree in accordance with this opinion. Reversed and remanded.
All Justices concur except OLIVER, C. J., and PETERSON, J., who take no part.

David COPELAND
v.
PERSONNEL BOARD OF JEFFERSON COUNTY, Oscar Stillwagon, and Belinda Rushon.
Civ. 5429.
Court of Civil Appeals of Alabama.
November 5, 1986.
*855 David Copeland, pro se.
Charles H. Wyatt, Jr., Birmingham, for appellees Stillwagon and Rushon.
Judson Eugene Tomlin, Jr., and Charles A. McCallum III of Haskell, Slaughter & Young, Birmingham, for appellee Personnel Bd. of Jefferson County.
BRADLEY, Judge.
This is an appeal of a Jefferson County Personnel Board decision.
The plaintiff in the present case was prosecuted in the Birmingham Municipal Court on criminal charges involving assault, battery, and harassment. The plaintiff subpoenaed over seventy witnesses to testify in his defense to the criminal charges brought against him in the municipal court. One of the persons subpoenaed was Mr. Oscar Stillwagon, the chief clerk for the Birmingham Municipal Court.
After the criminal proceeding, at which the plaintiff was convicted of the charges against him and ordered to pay a fine, the plaintiff filed a complaint with the Jefferson County Personnel Board wherein he sought the dismissal of Mr. Stillwagon and another municipal court employee, Ms. Belinda Rushon, who was the subpoena clerk.
A hearing was held by the Jefferson County Personnel Board wherein the Board examined the conduct of both employees. At the hearing the plaintiff alleged that Mr. Stillwagon was guilty of misconduct for failing to appear at the previous criminal proceeding after being subpoenaed. The plaintiff alleged that Ms. Rushon was guilty of misconduct for failing to properly issue all of the subpoenas he requested be issued.
During the Personnel Board hearing the plaintiff voluntarily dropped the complaint he previously lodged against Ms. Rushon. The remainder of the proceeding, therefore, was devoted to the allegations surrounding Mr. Stillwagon's conduct. After the hearing the Personnel Board concluded that Mr. Stillwagon was not guilty of misconduct, and, therefore, dismissed the charges against him.
The plaintiff subsequently sought review of the Personnel Board decision by the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, and a three-judge panel was appointed to review the Personnel Board decision. The three-judge panel affirmed the decision of the Jefferson County Personnel Board. The plaintiff seeks review in this court.
The method of review of a three-judge circuit court panel decision upholding a Jefferson County Personnel Board order is by common-law writ of certiorari. See Ex parte Smith, 394 So.2d 45 (Ala.Civ.App. 1981). Review of the writ of certiorari in this court is limited to a consideration of the proper application of the law by the circuit court and whether that court's decision is supported by the legal evidence. Ex parte Smith, supra.
The record in the present case indicates that the plaintiff filed a complaint with the Personnel Board, alleging that Mr. Stillwagon failed to answer a subpoena. The record also indicates the plaintiff filed a complaint against Ms. Rushon, alleging she was guilty of misconduct for failing to issue several subpoenas. The plaintiff voluntarily *856 dismissed his complaint against Ms. Rushon at trial.
The testimony before the Personnel Board indicates that Mr. Stillwagon was served with a subpoena to appear at the plaintiff's trial in municipal court; however, because of job-related obligations, Mr. Stillwagon had to be in Ensley, Alabama on the day of the plaintiff's criminal trial. In an effort to comply with the subpoena, Mr. Stillwagon informed Municipal Court Judge Emory Anthony of the circumstances necessitating his absence from court. Judge Anthony nonetheless placed Mr. Stillwagon on call in the event that his testimony was necessary for the disposition of the criminal case.
The plaintiff attempted to call Mr. Stillwagon as a witness in the marathon municipal case which lasted almost a day and in which the plaintiff subpoenaed over seventy witnesses. The plaintiff purportedly wanted to use Mr. Stillwagon's testimony to impeach the testimony of one of his own prior witnesses. The record indicates, however, that Judge Anthony denied the plaintiff's request that Stillwagon be allowed to testify because Stillwagon lacked personal knowledge about the matter at hand. As the evidence shows, Mr. Stillwagon was on call but did not testify because the trial judge ruled that his testimony would be irrelevant.
After a careful review of the record, we are satisfied there is an absence of evidence that would support a finding that either Ms. Rushon or Mr. Stillwagon was guilty of misconduct during plaintiff's criminal trial. Mr. Stillwagon did answer the subpoena, and the complaint against Ms. Rushon was dropped at the Personnel Board hearing. For these reasons, we hold that the circuit court's decision is supported by the evidence. See, City of Mobile v. Seals, 471 So.2d 431 (Ala.Civ.App. 1985). Therefore, its judgment is affirmed.
AFFIRMED.

Bankruptcy Case No. 96-72781, Adversary Nos. 96-7198, 96-7199.

OPINION
LARRY L. LESSEN, Bankruptcy Judge.
The two issues before the Court are (i) the scope of protection provided by preserving the benefits of a PACA trust through the newly-authorized method of placing a statutorily-prescribed statement on a bill or invoice statement as opposed to preserving one's rights through the traditional written *20 notice, and (ii) whether a PACA statutory trust is a "true trust" or merely a disguised security agreement.
Kelly Food Products, Inc. ("Kelly") is a Chapter 11 Debtor-in-possession. First of America Bank-Illinois, N.A. ("FOA") is Kelly's largest secured creditor with a first priority security interest in virtually all of Kelly's assets, including inventory and accounts receivable. FOA currently holds approximately $330,000 of Kelly's cash assets, to which Plaintiffs claim they are entitled under the provisions of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act ("PACA"), 7 U.S.C. § 499e. FOA concedes that its first priority security interest in the subject $330,000 would be inferior to a valid PACA trust claim.
This matter is before the Court on Plaintiffs' Motion for Turnover wherein Plaintiffs assert that, as the only protected PACA claimants, they are entitled to have the $330,000 being held by FOA turned over to them. Kelly objects to the turnover, claiming that the funds are not PACA trust assets because the new method of preserving trust claims, through placing the prescribed language on the invoice or bill, limits the assets subject to the trust claims to the particular inventory and proceeds from their inventory which, Kelly further asserts (and is essentially conceded), are long gone. Kelly cites In re Zois, 201 B.R. 501 (Bankr.N.D.Ill.1996) for the proposition that the res of a PACA trust on perishable goods disappears as the perishable goods perish. Plaintiffs counter that the sole purpose and effect of the new subsection was to create another way for suppliers to preserve their rights in the trust and that the new subsection has no bearing on the nature or extent of the PACA trust.
PACA creates a non-segregated floating trust on perishable commodities that permits the commingling of trust assets without defeating the trust. In re Zois, supra at 509; Endico Potatoes, Inc. v. CIT Group/Factoring, Inc., 67 F.3d 1063, 1067 (2d Cir.1995); JSG Trading Corp. v. Tray-Wrap, Inc., 917 F.2d 75, 78 (2d Cir.1990). In order to preserve the trust, 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c)(3) requires that the seller give the purchaser written notice of intent to preserve the PACA trust benefits and file that notice with the Secretary of Agriculture within a prescribed period of time. The PACA notice must be in writing, state that it is a notice of intent to preserve PACA trust benefits and include certain prescribed information.
In November 15, 1995, 7 U.S.C. § 499e was amended to add subsection (c)(4), which provided an alternative method of preserving the benefits of the PACA trust. Under this amendment, a beneficiary may use ordinary and usual billing or invoice statements to provide notice of the supplier's intent to preserve the trust. To accomplish preservation of the trust benefits under this subsection, the bill or invoice must contain on its face the following language:
The perishable agricultural commodities listed on this invoice are sold subject to the statutory trust authorized by section 5(c) of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, 1930 (7 U.S.C. 499e(c)). The seller of these commodities retains a trust claim over these commodities, all inventories of food or other products derived from these commodities, and any receivables or proceeds from the sale of these commodities until full payment is received.
7 U.S.C. § 499e(c)(4).
In this case, it is conceded that the Plaintiffs preserved their rights under the trust provisions of 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c) through the method set forth in subsection (c)(4) with the required language. Plaintiff G & G Sales Corporation ("G & G") asserts a PACA trust claim in the amount of $259,860.06 and Plaintiff Red River Valley Potato Marketing Association ("Red River") asserts a PACA trust claim is the amount of $181,455.03.
On the issue of the scope of the new method of trust preservation under PACA, this appears to be a question of first impression in the federal courts. While there is no judicial precedent interpreting this new subsection, the legislative history provides solid evidence of Congress' intent. H.R.Rep. No. 207, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., at 9 (1995) states in part as follows:
The amendments to the PACA trust provisions contained in this legislation are intended to strengthen and improve the operation of the trust and eliminate the *21 expense to USDA in administering these provisions. . . .
To enhance the operation of the trust, an alternate method of preserving trust benefits has been included in the bill. The current requirement to file a trust notice with the USDA is eliminated. Instead, the legislation makes clear that a licensee may use standard invoices or other billing statements to provide notice to the buyer of intent to preserve trust benefits . . .
Under current law, the trust is in effect at the time of shipment of the perishable commodity. The unpaid supplier, seller or agent must provide notice of trust coverage to the buyer in order to preserve these trust benefits. Consistent with this principle, this legislation, under paragraph 4 of section 5(c) of PACA, provides that the suppliers, seller, or agent may perfect its trust claim by giving notice to the buyer on the invoice or billing statement. This change to the Act provides both a convenience and cost savings to the unpaid supplier, seller or agent. The Committee intends the effect of notice provided through the use of usual billing or invoice statements to be the legal equivalent to the current practice of providing notice subsequent to the payment date by means independent of the billing statement or invoice. (Emphasis added).
It is quite clear that Congress' intent in adding § 499e(c)(4) was to provide a simpler and, for the government, a less expensive way for suppliers to preserve their trust rights. It is equally clear that Congress had no intent to redefine what constitutes the trust res under PACA. If Congress had intended to redefine or limit the trust res, it could have and should have amended § 499e(c)(2), which defines trust res, rather than dealing with the issue in a subsection relating only to preservation. In addition, the last sentence of the legislative history set forth above is very clear about the effect of the amendment  it says that the new method of trust preservation is the legal equivalent of the then current practice of filing notice set forth in subsection (c)(3). It says nothing about providing lesser or different protection through the new alternative manner of preservation. Clearly, if it had been Congress' intent to do what Kelly has asserted, the legislative history would not say that the new method of trust preservation is the legal equivalent of filing notice; moreover, the statute, or at least the legislative history, would have explicitly stated that the alternative method of preservation, though available, provides much more limited protection to suppliers. In fact, in the context of perishable agricultural commodities, the protection provided by § 499e(c)(4) under Kelly's interpretation would be so fleeting as to be virtually meaningless in many contexts where the useful life of the products is only a matter of days. Virtually no informed perishable commodity supplier would use § 499e(c)(4) because of the greatly reduced benefit as compared to the traditional manner of preservation and corresponding trust. Finally, if Kelly's position were correct, Congress would have set a dangerous (and well-camouflaged) trap for unwary sellers with its 1995 amendment, completely undercutting the purpose of PACA, which was enacted to protect such sellers.
Kelly's reliance on In re Zois, supra, in support of its position is misplaced. Kelly accurately cites Zois for the holding that a PACA trust res consisting of perishable goods disappears as the perishable goods perish. However, this holding does not purport to define or limit the scope of a PACA trust res or alter how a supplier avails itself of PACA protection; in fact, Judge Schmetterer's opinion in Zois is in accord with other published precedent on the issues of what constitutes the res of a PACA trust and how a supplier protects its interest in the trust. Zois acknowledges that "(t)here is no necessity to specifically identify all of the trust assets through each step of the asset accrual and disposal process. Since commingling is contemplated, all trust assets would be subject to the claims of unpaid seller-suppliers and agents to the extent of the amount owed them." Zois, supra at 509, citing H.R.Rep. No. 98-543 (1983), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 405. In addition, Zois acknowledges that a "PACA (t)rust consists of perishable goods, products derived from those goods, and all receivables or proceeds from the sale of those goods." Zois, supra *22 at 508, citing 7 U.S.C.A. § 499e(c)(2). Accordingly, the fact that Zois recognizes that a PACA trust res may diminish through both liquidation and rotting does little to advance Kelly's position.
The second question raised is Kelly's interest in the subject $330,000. Kelly asserts that it has an interest in the funds superior to that of FOA by virtue of the trustee's strong-arm powers under 11 U.S.C. § 551, which Kelly may exercise as a debtor-in-possession pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 1107(a). However, Kelly concedes that it has no strong-arm powers if the $330,000 is subject to a "true trust"; Kelly argues that the PACA trust is not a "true trust", but is more like a "floating lien" or a "disguised security agreement" under the Uniform Commercial Code. Defendant's Points & Authorities, pp. 5-6. Plaintiffs counter that the PACA trust is a "true trust" and, such being the case, Kelly has no interest in the funds and, consequently, no standing to object to the Motion for Turnover.
On the question of whether the PACA trust is a "true trust", the federal courts have unanimously answered the question in the affirmative. See Matter of Snyder, 184 B.R. 473, 475 (D.Md.1995) (the PACA trust satisfies all of the requirements of an express trust); In re Harper, 150 B.R. 416, 418-19 (Bankr.E.D.Tenn.1993) (PACA trust satisfies express trust requirements); In re Nix, 1992 WL 119143, p. 9. (M.D.Ga.) (PACA creates a true trust). Kelly failed to provide, and this Court was unable to find, any case which held that the PACA trust was anything other than a "true trust". Accordingly, Kelly's theory, though innovative, is without any precedential support and hence must be rejected.
To summarize, the subject $330,000 is not subject to Kelly's strong-arm powers pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 551 because it has been properly preserved in a PACA trust, which the Court finds to be a true trust and not a disguised security agreement. Hence, Kelly, by its own admission, has no interest in the $330,000 in the hands of FOA. Even if it had been determined that Kelly had an interest in the funds, the Court finds that, by properly preserving their trust claims pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c)(4), Plaintiffs' trust claims are not limited only to receivables attributable to the specific goods described in their invoices, but rather extend to the subject $330,000 as well.
As stated above, G & G asserts a PACA trust claim in the amount of $259,860.06 and Red River's PACA trust claim is for $181,455.03. Hence, the aggregate amount of valid PACA trust claims is $441,315.09. Plaintiffs and FOA have previously agreed that $20,000 of the available funds should be held back for future administrative costs in collecting accounts receivable, leaving approximately $310,000 available for distribution to valid PACA trust claimants. As G & G's trust claim constitutes 58.88311% of the total valid trust claims, G & G is entitled to 58.88311% of the funds collected by FOA (less $20,000 holdback), or approximately $182,537.64 ($310,000 × .5888311). Red River's claim is 41.11689% of the total valid trust claims; hence Red River is entitled to 41.11689% of the funds collected by FOA (less $20,000 holdback), or approximately $127,462.36 ($310,000 × .4111689).
For the reasons set forth above, Plaintiffs' Motion for Emergency Relief and Immediate Turnover of Trust Funds is granted.
This Opinion is to serve as Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law pursuant to Rule 7052 of the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure.

        Again, we are asked to decide whether Mark Davis, a former member of Highland

Coryell Ranch, LLC, may peruse various books and records of the company.1 The parties

initially broached the issue to us via an appeal from a summary judgment favoring

Highland. See Davis v. Highland Coryell Ranch, LLC, No. 07-15-00269-CV, 2016 Tex.

App. LEXIS 3138 (Tex. App.—Amarillo Mar. 18, 2018, pet. denied) (mem. op.). Due to



        1 Because this appeal was transferred from the Tenth Court of Appeals, we are obligated to apply
its precedent when available in the event of a conflict between the precedents of that court and this Court.
See TEX. R. APP. P. 41.3.
the absence from the summary judgment record of pertinent company records, though,

we were unable to provide them a substantive answer. Id. at *4–5 (stating that “[t]he

summary judgment record before us does not contain the ‘governing documents’ of

Highland. Without them, the trial court could not hold that Highland established, as a

matter of law, that Davis was unentitled to view the records.”). Upon remand, Highland

filed a second summary judgment motion. Attached to it were the governing documents

alluded to in our first opinion. The trial court granted the motion, thereby denying Davis

opportunity to review the documents and disposing of his suit to access them. We

reverse.

       Law of the Case

       A preliminary matter before us concerns the doctrine of law of the case. Davis

argues that, through our prior opinion, we held that the statutes in play entitled him, as a

matter of law, to review the records. Thus, our purported holding allegedly constitutes

the law of the case, controls the outcome here, and requires reversal without further

comment. We disagree.

       Per the doctrine of law of the case, questions of law decided on appeal to a court

of last resort generally govern the case throughout its subsequent stages.          State v.

Riemer, No. 07-18-00002-CV, 2019 Tex. App. LEXIS 1801, at *5 (Tex. App.—Amarillo

Mar. 7, 2019, no pet.). In other words, a court of appeals is ordinarily bound by its initial

decision if there is a subsequent appeal in the same case. See Briscoe v. Goodmark

Corp., 102 S.W.3d 714, 716 (Tex. 2003). Reconsideration of issues is not absolutely

barred, however. Id. Indeed, whether to apply the doctrine is a discretionary matter. Id.;

Riemer, 2019 Tex. App. LEXIS 1801, at *5.          Examples of when discretion may be



                                             2
exercised legitimately to forgo application of the doctrine include situations where either

the issues or facts presented in successive appeals substantially differ from those

presented earlier, see Riemer, 2019 Tex. App. LEXIS 1801, at *5–6, and where the prior

decision was clearly wrong. See Briscoe, 102 S.W.3d at 716–17. Highland argues,

among other things, that if we did interpret the relevant statutes in a manner favorable to

Davis, then we were clearly wrong. That, at the very least, is a sufficient reason to forgo

the doctrine’s application here. Simply put, a wrong decision is subject to correction.

       Additionally, our resolution of the prior appeal revolved around whether Highland

established its entitlement to summary judgment as a matter of law based on the

summary judgment record before the trial court. Though we alluded to statutes there that

have continued relevance here, the central debate here differs from that there. As we

observed in our initial opinion, the statutory definitions in play here were not cited or

addressed by either party there. Davis, 2016 Tex. App. LEXIS 3138, at *3. So, the issue

now before us differs in a substantive way.

       Given the foregoing circumstances, the doctrine raised by Davis does not control.

We may proceed to substantively address that which neither party did previously.

       Former Member and Business Records

       Next, Highland is a limited liability company. Furthermore, no one disputes that

Davis was one of two original members. Nor do the litigants dispute that he relinquished

his interest in the company in 2005.       Davis, 2016 Tex. App. LEXIS 3138, at *1.

Furthermore, Davis requested of Highland various business records developed by the

company while he was a member. Id. It apparently provided some but not others, and

Davis sued to obtain those that were not given him. Highland moved for summary



                                              3
judgment, contending that, as an ex-member of the business, he had no right to them.

The sole issue before us involves the right, if any, of a former member of a limited liability

company to business records of the company. That is, can he be denied access simply

because he is not a current member of the company?

       Per § 101.502(a) of the Texas Business Organizations Code, a “member of a

limited liability company or an assignee of a membership interest . . . or a representative

of the member or assignee, on written request and for a proper purpose, may examine

and copy at any reasonable time and at the member’s or assignee’s expense . . . [both]

records required under Sections 3.151 and 101.501 . . . and . . . other information

regarding the business, affairs, and financial condition of the company that is reasonable

for the person to examine and copy.” TEX. BUS. ORGS. CODE ANN. § 101.502(a)(1), (2)

(West 2012) (emphasis added); Davis, 2016 Tex. App. LEXIS 3138, at *2. Section 3.153

of the same Code further provides that “[e]ach owner or member . . . may examine the

books and records of the filing entity maintained under Section 3.151 and other books

and records . . . to the extent provided by the governing documents of the entity and the

title of this code governing the filing entity.” TEX. BUS. ORGS. CODE ANN. § 3.153 (West

2012); Davis, 2016 Tex. App. LEXIS 3138, at *2.

       The same Code also defines a “member” of a limited liability company as “a person

who is a member or has been admitted as a member in the limited liability company

under its governing documents.” TEX. BUS. ORGS. CODE ANN. § 1.002(53)(A) (emphasis

added).2




       2When used in reference to a limited liability company, “owner” is defined as “a member.” TEX.
BUS. ORGS. CODE ANN. § 1.002(63)(C) (West Supp. 2018).

                                                 4
       As can be seen from these provisions, the right to peruse the business records of

a limited liability company is generally dependent upon membership in or being a

“member” of the company. Furthermore, one is such a “member” if he “is a member” or

“has been admitted as a member” under the company’s governing documents. One

recalling lessons from high school English classes would interpret the phrase “is a

member” as denoting a present verb tense, that is, a verb tense requiring the person to

be an existing member of the company. Davis does not fall within that category given his

relinquishment of his interest in Highland years ago.

       The debate here focuses upon whether the phrase “has been admitted as a

member” encompasses a person who once was but no longer is a member. Davis says

“yes,” while Highland says “no.” Again, harkening back to high school English would lead

one to categorize “has been” as the present perfect tense of the verb “to be.” Additionally,

the present perfect tense of a verb is susceptible to use in several different situations. It

could refer to a past action that continues. For instance, the sentence “she has gone to

the store” denotes the departure of a person who remains absent. In this sense, “has

been admitted as a member” of a limited liability company could mean that the person

was admitted sometime in the past and remains a member.

       Present perfect tense may also describe a past action that simply occurred at some

time or another without continuing effect. For example, let us envision Jim, Jack, and Joe

talking over a cup of coffee. Let us also picture Jim asking Jack if Joe ever lost his car

keys. Jack may answer: “Yes, Joe has lost his car keys.” In so replying, Jack is not

suggesting that Joe’s keys remain lost, but only that he lost them in the past at some time

or another. In that sense, “has been admitted as a member” of a limited liability company



                                             5
could mean that the person was admitted at some time or another in the past without

requiring that his status as a member continues.

       Highland would have us adopt the former reading of “has been admitted as a

member” and thereby require continuing membership when the request for records is

made. Yet, our doing so would lead us to violate a rule of statutory construction. That

rule obligates us to afford meaning to each word of a statute. See In re Office of the Att’y

Gen., 422 S.W.3d 623, 629 (Tex. 2013) (orig. proceeding).          To the extent that the

legislature here incorporated the phrases “is a member” and “has been admitted as a

member” into the meaning of “member” then each passage must be given effect.

Highland’s interpretation does not do that.

       If “has been admitted as a member” requires that membership continue, as

Highland suggests, then that is little more than saying the person “is a member” of the

entity. The first category of the definition provided in § 1.002(53)(A) would engulf the

second. The word “member,” in that scenario, would be “a person who is a member or

has been admitted as a member [and is a member].” In other words, the member would

have to be a member or someone who is a member because he was admitted as a

member. Confusing? It certainly is. In either scenario, he would be a member, and we

would be left to wonder why the legislature would define “member” as “a member” of the

company and “a member” of the company because he was admitted to the company as

a member. In effect, our adopting Highland’s suggestion would render the passage “has

been admitted as a member” redundant. That we cannot do under In re Office of the

Attorney General.




                                              6
        Instead, we give the passage meaning by treating it in the present perfect tense

referring to an action or event that occurred at one time but is not necessarily continuing.

This would result in defining “member” as encompassing both one who “is a member”

and one who once was admitted as a member at some time or another but who no longer

is such. Indeed, the words “has been admitted as a member” literally encompass as

much, and “[w]e take the Legislature at its word.” In re Office of the Att’y Gen., 422

S.W.3d at 629. The text is unambiguous and, therefore, determinative. See id. (stating

that “[b]ecause the statute itself is what constitutes the law, we have held that

unambiguous text equals determinative text” barring absurdity).

        Nor would it be absurd to so construe § 1.002(53)(A). It does not open the door to

past members of a limited liability corporation being able to obtain whatever record the

company may have irrespective of the time the record was developed. Rather, the

legislature curtailed that likelihood by inserting into § 101.502(a) certain restrictive

language. It imposed upon the member requesting documents to do so “for a proper

purpose.” TEX. BUS. ORGS. CODE ANN. § 101.502(a). That means the past member would

have to show a “proper purpose” for requesting business records unrelated to his tenure

as a member; he cannot have them just because he wants them.3

        We further note          another consideration supporting our construction of

§ 1.002(53)(A).      Section 101.054 of the Code describes instances when the limited

liability company’s governing document may deviate from statutory edict. Subsection




        3 While Highland’s brief can be read as raising the specter of “proper purpose” and whether Davis

mentioned one, that was not a ground upon which it sought summary judgment. Being omitted from the
motion, we cannot use it as a basis to affirm. See State Farm Lloyds v. Page, 315 S.W.3d 525, 532 (Tex.
2010) (“Summary judgment may not be affirmed on appeal on a ground not presented to the trial court in
the motion.”).

                                                   7
101.054 prohibits that document or “company agreement” from “unreasonably restrict[ing]

a person’s right of access to records and information under Section 101.052.”                             Id.

§ 101.054(e) (West Supp. 2018) (emphasis added). The passage denotes a legislative

desire to forgo undue or excessive restriction on rights of access. If we were to adopt

Highland’s position, then no past member of the company could obtain its business

records even if that ex-member had a “proper purpose” for seeking them.4 It would not

take much to perceive an utter prohibition to those records as an unreasonable restriction.

To that we observe the use of the word “person” in § 101.054(e), as opposed to “member.”

The definition of same provided us in the Business Organizations Code comprises a

category of individuals and entities much larger than mere “members” of the LLC. See

TEX. BUS. ORGS. CODE ANN., § 1.002 (69-b) (West Supp. 2018) (defining “person” as

meaning “an individual or a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, business

trust, trust, association, or other organization, estate, government or governmental

subdivision or agency, or other legal entity, or a series of a domestic limited liability

company or foreign entity”). Using such an expansive term in place of the more restrictive


        4  Indeed, a potential proper purpose for an ex-member retaining some right to access corporate
records is exemplified in one of the statutes cited by the dissent. It mentions that a portion of § 101.111 of
the Business Organizations Code would be made redundant if the definition of members were to include
those admitted at one time or another under the agreement but who had assigned their interest to another.
The provision in question, § 101.111(a) provides that an assignor remains a member until the assignee
becomes a member. TEX. BUS. ORGS. CODE ANN. § 101.111(a) (West 2012). “If . . . former members remain
members . . . that provision is unnecessary,” according to the dissent. Yet, per subparagraph (b), that same
assignor “is not released from the assignor’s liability to the company, regardless of whether the assignee
of the membership interest becomes a member of the company.” Id. § 101.111(b). As can be seen, ex-
members may have certain continuing liabilities to the company. If Highland’s (and the dissent’s) position
were adopted, then that ex-member could not obtain documents or records relevant to that liability or its
extent. We question whether it would be farfetched to envision a scenario where current management of
a LLC tells the ex-member: “our calculations indicate you owe the LLC X dollars and you have no right to
look at the business records to check our math.” Experience indicates that such is a possibility, if not
probability, when a business relationship ends in acrimony sometimes reminiscent of a divorce. It may well
be that Highland was right when positing at oral argument that the ex-member could always obtain needed
business records via the initiation of legal proceedings. Our interpretation of an ex-member’s right to
business documents relegates the judicial option to the end position of options available. The interpretation
of Highland and the dissent makes it the first.

                                                      8
“member” or “members” tends to suggest a legislative intent favoring a grant of access to

more than just current members of the LLC.

        The dissent characterizes our opinion here as “a ‘once a member, always a

member’ concept” and concludes that such a concept “is foreign to our state’s LLC statute

and runs directly contrary to many of its provisions.” Yet, how foreign is it when 1)

practitioners opine that the company is required to provide “Members and former

Members access to the Company’s books and records pursuant to § 3.151, 3.152, and

3.153” of the Business Organizations Code, e.g. Frank Z. Ruttenberg, Formation and

Governance Issues in Company Agreements, State Bar of Tex. Prof. Dev. Program, 14th

Annual Choice, Governance & Acquisition of Entities Course ch. 2.2, at 34 (2016), or 2)

the same statute expressly states that “[a] member of a limited liability company may not

withdraw or be expelled from the company.” TEX. BUS. ORGS. CODE ANN. § 101.107

(emphasis added).5 We do not purport to generally say that once an entity or person

becomes a member it is always a member for all purposes as the dissent insinuates and

irrespective of whatever the legislature may have meant when stating that a member may

not withdraw.      No doubt, certain ties remain, as exemplified in § 101.111(b) when

addressing a member’s continued liability to the company upon assignment of the

member’s interest. Our opinion simply recognizes and addresses the continuation of one

such limited tie when it comes to those who relinquished their interest in the company yet

seek access to business records for a proper purpose.




        5Section 101.107 of the Code invokes images of Michael Corleone’s frustration when saying “[j]ust
when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!” The Godfather, Part III (1990).


                                                   9
         Years ago, a famed rock and roll band sang, “I’m just a soul whose intentions are

good. Oh Lord, please don’t let me be misunderstood.”6 No doubt the intentions of the

Texas legislature were good in enacting the statutes at play here, and we endeavor to not

misunderstand what they were. Yet, the juxtaposition of words within a statute do not

always result in clarity. Should our disposition of this appeal fall short of capturing what

the legislature intended, we would welcome its clarification of the matter.7 Until it or higher

authority intercedes, though, our reading of the relevant statutes controls the dispute

between Davis and Highland. And, our reading leads us to conclude that a former

member of a limited liability company is not prohibited from accessing business records

of the company for a proper purpose simply because he is not a member at the time of

the request. No one is free to read into our decision more than what is there. We do not

intend it to cover more than the specific topic broached by Davis and Highland in this

appeal. Nor may either party construe it as mandating that Davis must be afforded the

records he seeks; the relevant statutes impose other criteria that must be satisfied, such

as a proper purpose underlying the request.

         Because the trial court erred in granting summary judgment upon the limited

ground posed by Highland, we reverse it and remand the cause.

         7
         To that extent, we welcome a dissent here which may bring with it an enhanced likelihood of
garnering intervention and clarification by our Supreme Court.

                                       No. 110,061

                                    STATE OF KANSAS,
                                        Appellee,

                                             v.

                                   SHELBERT L. SMITH,
                                       Appellant.


                             SYLLABUS BY THE COURT

1.
       The factual findings underlying a trial court's ruling on a motion to appeal out of
time pursuant to State v. Ortiz, 230 Kan. 733, 640 P.2d 1255 (1982), are reviewed for
substantial competent evidence, while the legal determinations are reviewed de novo.


2.
       Appellate courts in Kansas have declined to find a constitutional right to appeal
and generally exercise jurisdiction only where an appeal conforms to the applicable
statutes.


3.
       The court in State v. Ortiz, 230 Kan. 733, 640 P.2d 1255 (1982), created judicial
exceptions to the general rule barring untimely appeals. Under those exceptions, an
untimely appeal may be allowed when: (1) the defendant was not informed of his or her
right to appeal; (2) the defendant was not furnished an attorney to pursue the appeal; or
(3) the defendant was furnished an attorney who failed to perfect the appeal.



                                             1
4.
        Under the third exception in State v. Ortiz, 230 Kan. 733, 640 P.2d 1255 (1982),
the defendant must establish that: (1) he or she told counsel to appeal, but the attorney
failed to file or perfect the appeal; and, (2) he or she would have timely appealed, but for
counsel's failure. The lapse of time between the defendant's directive to counsel to file an
appeal and defendant's attempt to use the third Ortiz exception to file an out-of-time
appeal, standing alone, is not a threshold bar to the untimely appeal as a matter of law.


        Appeal from Sedgwick District Court; GREGORY L. WALLER, judge. Opinion filed August 5,
2016. Reversed and remanded with directions.


        Michelle A. Davis, of Kansas Appellate Defender Office, argued the cause and was on the brief
for appellant.


        Lance J. Gillett, assistant district attorney, argued the cause, and Marc Bennett, district attorney,
and Derek Schmidt, attorney general, were with him on the brief for appellee.


The opinion of the court was delivered by


        JOHNSON, J.: Shelbert Smith appeals the district court's denial of his motion to file
a direct appeal out of time. He argues that he should be allowed an untimely appeal
because his appointed trial counsel failed to file the appeal that Smith requested. Because
this case is presented to us without adequate factual findings, we remand to the district
court to make the requisite findings pursuant to the framework described in this opinion.


                              FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL OVERVIEW

        Smith was convicted as an adult in 1993, after pleading nolo contendere to first-
degree felony murder, aggravated kidnapping, aggravated robbery, and possession of a

                                                      2
firearm by a minor. At the time, Smith was 16 years old. The district court sentenced
Smith to life sentences for the murder and aggravated kidnapping convictions, 10 years to
life for the aggravated robbery conviction, and 30 days in jail for the firearms conviction,
all to run consecutively.


       Smith asserts that he told his appointed counsel, Max Opperman, immediately
after sentencing that he wanted to file an appeal but that his attorney had advised him to
wait until the district court ruled on a motion to modify his sentence before appealing.
Under a procedure available at the time, commonly called the 120-day callback, a court
could modify a sentence within 120 days of sentencing in certain circumstances. See
K.S.A. 21-4603(d)(1) [then K.S.A. 1992 Supp. 21-4603(4)(a)]. In other words, a
successful sentence modification on a callback motion might change the necessity for or
character of an appeal of the original sentence.


       Smith's attorney did file a modification motion. But after the district court
overruled the motion on March 3, 1994, counsel never filed a direct appeal of Smith's
sentence.


       Nearly 2 decades later, on May 1, 2013, Smith filed a pro se notice of appeal, a
motion for an out-of-time appeal, and a motion for appointed counsel. Subsequently, his
appointed counsel filed a docketing statement. See K.S.A. 2015 Supp. 22-3601(b)(3).
This court ordered Smith to show cause why the untimely appeal should not be dismissed
for lack of jurisdiction, and Smith responded that he should be allowed to appeal out of
time under one of the exceptions in State v. Ortiz, 230 Kan. 733, 640 P.2d 1255 (1982).
This court remanded to the district court to rule on Smith's motion for an out-of-time
appeal, which would include an Ortiz hearing if necessary.




                                              3
       At the district court hearing, the only evidence presented was Smith's testimony
that, immediately after he was sentenced, he told Opperman that he wanted to appeal, but
that Opperman had told Smith to wait for the result of the 120-day callback procedure.
Smith said he never heard from Opperman after the 120-day callback period ended,
despite persistent attempts to contact him. Smith said he called Opperman's office, two to
three times per day, for most of 1994 but was unable to reach him. Smith said his mother
also attempted to contact Opperman and was likewise unsuccessful. Smith said he
eventually gave up because he "was in limbo" and did not know what to do, until 19
years later when he found someone at the Hutchinson Correctional Facility who helped
Smith with his appeal.


       Opperman died in 2009. Therefore, the State was unable to present trial counsel's
testimony. The State presented no other evidence but argued that based on the Kansas
Court of Appeals decision in State v. Cole, No. 105,745, 2012 WL 1649886 (Kan. App.
2012) (unpublished opinion), rev. denied 296 Kan. 1131 (2013), Smith had waived his
right to bring an untimely appeal by waiting so long.


       The district court denied Smith's motion. The district court did not make any
findings of fact as to whether Smith had told Opperman to file an appeal, other than to
say, "Well, we have the statement of the defendant somewhat to that effect." Rather, the
district court relied on the Cole decision to find that the passage of time was a bar to
Smith's appeal, stating:


               "But the thing that the Court cannot get over is the fact that the defendant waited
       all these years and said absolutely nothing, did absolutely nothing.
               "In light of the decision of the Court [of Appeals] in State versus Cole, the
       [Kansas] Supreme Court would not be receptive. This Court cannot be receptive."




                                                    4
       Smith timely appealed the district court's ruling.


              THE PASSAGE OF TIME AS A WAIVER OF AN ORTIZ EXCEPTION

       Smith argues that he should be allowed to bring his direct appeal out of time,
pursuant to Ortiz, because his attorney did not file an appeal despite Smith's direction to
do so, and Smith would have timely taken an appeal but for his counsel's
nonperformance. The State argues that the lapse of time between sentencing and Smith's
notice of appeal precludes review because, by letting the matter rest, Smith waived his
right to an appeal.


Standard of Review

       This court exercises unlimited review over the issue of appellate jurisdiction. State
v. Scoville, 286 Kan. 800, 803, 188 P.3d 959 (2008). The factual findings underlying a
trial court's ruling in an Ortiz hearing are reviewed for substantial competent evidence,
while the legal determinations are reviewed de novo. State v. Gill, 287 Kan. 289, 293,
196 P.3d 369 (2008).


Analysis

       Appellate courts in Kansas have declined to find a constitutional right to appeal
and generally exercise jurisdiction only where an appeal conforms to the applicable
statutes. 287 Kan. at 293-94. Crimes committed before July 1, 1993, were required to be
appealed within "10 days after the expiration of the district court's power to modify the
sentence." K.S.A. 22-3608(a). For sentences imposed under K.S.A. 21-4603(d)(1), the
district court could modify the sentence within 120 days (the 120-day callback).
Effectively, then, Smith had 130 days from the date of sentencing in which to appeal his
sentence.
                                             5
       There is no question that Smith's appeal was filed past the statutory deadline and
that the general rule would result in its dismissal. See Albright v. State, 292 Kan. 193,
197, 251 P.3d 52 (2011). But Ortiz created judicial exceptions to the general rule barring
untimely appeals. Under those exceptions, an untimely appeal may be allowed when: (1)
the defendant was not informed of his or her right to appeal; (2) the defendant was not
furnished an attorney to pursue the appeal; or (3) the defendant was furnished an attorney
who failed to perfect the appeal. State v. Patton, 287 Kan. 200, 206, 195 P.3d 753 (2008)
(citing Ortiz, 230 Kan. at 735-36). In Patton, this court developed rules for each of the
Ortiz exceptions. 287 Kan. at 219-24. In so doing, Patton emphasized that the general
rule barring untimely appeals was still exactly that—the general rule, and that the Ortiz
exceptions were "narrowly defined" and reserved for "truly exceptional circumstances."
Patton, 287 Kan. at 217.


       Patton recognized the second and third Ortiz exceptions are rooted in the concepts
of fundamental fairness and the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Patton, 287 Kan. at
218-19. Effectiveness of counsel is generally analyzed by the two-prong analysis of
performance and prejudice set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104
S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). Patton, 287 Kan. at 224. A defendant must first
establish that counsel's performance was deficient, and second, that counsel's
performance prejudiced the defense. 287 Kan. at 224. But the Patton court held that
under the third Ortiz exception, when counsel's deficient performance results in the
forfeiture of a proceeding, e.g., the right to an appeal process, the Strickland analysis is
modified by Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470, 120 S. Ct. 1029, 145 L. Ed. 2d 985
(2000):


               "Under Flores-Ortega, if appointed or retained counsel has failed to file or
       perfect a direct appeal by a criminal defendant, we will presume the existence of

       prejudice. This is not, however, the same as a finding of prejudice per se, requiring
       application of the third Ortiz exception. The defendant must still demonstrate that, but for
       counsel's failure, he or she would have taken a timely direct appeal. The defendant need
       not show, as he or she would have had to show if we were using the Strickland standard
       as our benchmark, that such a timely direct appeal would have been successful. [Citation
       omitted.]" Patton, 287 Kan. at 225.


       Here, Smith asserts that he falls under the third Ortiz exception because he told his
attorney he wanted to appeal immediately after sentencing and because he unsuccessfully
attempted to contact his attorney about proceeding with an appeal on numerous occasions
during the year following the expiration of the 120-day callback period, but that his
attorney failed to file the requested appeal. Had his attorney filed an appeal, Smith claims
that he would have pursued it.


       In response, the State argued, and the district court agreed, that Smith had waived
his right to appeal because he "let the matter rest" by waiting so many years to attempt to
proceed with the appeal pro se. The district court relied on Cole, where a panel of the
Court of Appeals said whether the defendant "let the matter rest" was a threshold
requirement a defendant must overcome in order to assert an Ortiz exception, and a
failure to timely assert an Ortiz exception could be considered a waiver of that right.
Cole, 2012 WL 1649886, at *2. In effect, Cole said that a defendant may not make an
untimely request to be allowed to make an untimely appeal.


       Cole's threshold requirement that a defendant must establish that he or she had not
"let the matter rest" as a condition precedent to establishing an Ortiz exception was
apparently crafted from the following language in Ortiz:


       "'A defendant properly informed of his appellate rights may not "let the matter rest,"
       Worts v. Dutton, 395 F.2d 341, 344 (5th Cir. 1968), and then claim that he did not waive

                                                    7
       his right to appeal.'" Ortiz, 230 Kan. at 736 (quoting Norris v. Wainwright, 588 F.2d 130,
       137 [5th Cir. 1979]).


       The quoted Fifth Circuit opinion, Norris v. Wainwright, 588 F.2d 130 (5th Cir.
1979), involved a different factual scenario. There, the defendant had been properly
informed of his appellate rights, but he did not direct his attorney to file an appeal. In
other words, the defendant made no contemporaneous attempt to invoke the right to
appeal which he had been told that he had. Here, the actions that Smith alleges that he
took during the year after he was properly informed of his appellate rights do not comport
with the Norris notion of letting the matter rest. Smith's immediate directive to his
attorney to appeal the sentence imposed is the antithesis of waiving his right to appeal;
rather, it was an invocation of his right to appeal contemporaneous with being advised of
that right. Perhaps a more accurate description of the district court's holding in this case
would be that Smith's suspension of his efforts to enforce his right to appeal for 19 years
constituted an abandonment of his right to appeal, as a matter of law.


       But requiring a defendant to establish the timeliness of his or her attempt to invoke
the third Ortiz exception adds a step to the proper analysis set forth in Patton, to-wit: (1)
Whether the defendant told his or her counsel to appeal, but the attorney failed to file or
perfect the appeal; and, (2) if so, the defendant will enjoy a presumption of prejudice but
must show that he or she would have timely appealed, but for counsel's failure. Patton,
287 Kan. at 225.


       Patton discussed the "let the matter rest" concept, but as a factor in the Flores-
Ortega two-prong performance and prejudice analysis. Patton, 287 Kan. at 225. The
court found that Patton had not "let the matter rest," based on evidence in the record that
showed Patton desired to pursue an appeal and had been attempting to do so, but for his
counsel's nonperformance. 287 Kan. at 225. In other words, as in Patton, Smith's dilatory

                                                   8
conduct might be relevant to the credibility of his claim that he told his attorney to appeal
or his claim that he would have proceeded with an appeal if his attorney had not failed
him. But the lapse of time between Smith telling his attorney to appeal and Smith's
attempt to use the third Ortiz exception to file an out-of-time appeal, standing alone, was
not a threshold bar to the untimely appeal as a matter of law. But cf. Gill, 287 Kan. at
296-97 (found 8-year delay while attempting to effect appeal warranted denial of out-of-
time appeal, but declined to "suggest[] any bright-line temporal rules").


       Because the district court found the appeal time-barred, it did not conduct a Patton
analysis. Thus, the district court did not make the requisite factual findings that would
support the claimed third Ortiz exception. Moreover, the cold record before us only
contains Smith's testimony. Whether this evidence is sufficient to meet Smith's burden
relies in part on its credibility. A witness' credibility is a determination for the district
court to make. See State v. Wilkerson, 278 Kan. 147, 156, 91 P.3d 1181 (2004) ("It is not
this court's function to weigh witness credibility."); Barger v. United States, 204 F.3d
1180, 1182 (8th Cir. 2000) ("A bare assertion by the petitioner that she made a request
[for counsel to file appeal] is not by itself sufficient to support a grant of relief, if
evidence that the fact-finder finds to be more credible indicates the contrary
proposition.").


       Accordingly, we are compelled to send this back to the district court once again
for the express purpose of determining whether Smith's testimony is credible, i.e.,
whether he told his attorney to appeal, whether the attorney did not file an appeal, and
whether Smith would have appealed if his attorney had not failed to perform. If Smith's
testimony is credible, he has established deficient performance under Flores-Ortega. See
Albright, 292 Kan. at 211. A lawyer who disregards specific instructions to file a notice
of appeal has acted in a professionally unreasonable manner, and the defendant is entitled
to a new appeal without a showing that the appeal would have been successful. 292 Kan.
                                                9
at 209-10 (quoting Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 477). In that event, Smith will be
permitted to appeal out of time.

WINTER, District Judge.
After her husband's fraudulent late filing of a joint return, and after her husband's death, can a spouse, who has no income but who joined her husband in filing a joint return, disavow the filing of the joint return so that liability for the entire tax is visited solely upon her deceased husband's estate? If not, can she, since the fraud was solely that of her husband, escape liability for the interest and penalty on the amount due? These questions are raised by the following agreed facts:

FACTS:
The taxpayer's husband, who died September 25, 1956, fraudulently failed to file a federal income tax return for the taxable year 1955 on the day that the return was dueApril 15, 1956. On July 2, 1956, there was filed a joint return, signed by both the taxpayer and her husband, for the calendar year 1955, which disclosed an income tax liability of $6,635.96. After audit, the return was accepted as filed, without change. Since no payment accompanied the return, a deficiency was assessed for the liability disclosed on the face of the return, plus interest and penalties, totalling $5,589.94, the principal item of the latter sum being the fraud penalty imposed because of the husband's fraudulent failure to file a timely tax return.
Taxpayer paid the deficiency of $12,225.90 on May 3, 1960, and has sued *862 for a refund. It is agreed that interest was overpaid in the amount of $43.61.
During the taxable year in question, taxpayer had no income of her own and taxpayer was innocent of her husband's fraudulent failure to file a federal income tax return for the taxable year 1955 when it was due.

DISCUSSION AND OPINION:
The right to file a joint income tax return is conferred by section 6013 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C.A. (1958 Ed.) § 6013, the pertinent portion of which is set forth below.[1] Other provisions of § 6013 limit the right of taxpayers to elect to file a joint return after having first filed separate returns.
The taxpayer, in reliance upon Grobart v. Commissioner, 20 T.C.M. 629 (1961), and Mundy v. Commissioner, 14 T.C.M. 1067 (1955), and a case cited in the former, Grant v. Rose, 24 F.2d 115 (D.C.N.D.Ga.1928), aff'd. Rose v. Grant, 39 F.2d 340 (5 Cir. 1930), argues that, by a proper construction of § 6013, the determination to file a joint return could not legally be made after the due date of the returnin this case April 15, 1956 so that the purported election made by the filing of the joint return on July 2, 1956 was a nullity. As a consequence, taxpayer argues that the deficiency, including interest and penalty, should have been assessed against her deceased husband's estate on the basis of a separate return filed by him. First, it should be noted that a reading of the quoted portion of § 6013, as, indeed, a reading of the section in its entirety, although indicating the situations where a joint return is available to spouses, does not state when the election to file a joint return in the first instance must be made or, if made, when it becomes binding on the taxpayer. The absence of such language is of great significance when other limitations on the filing of a joint return have been carefully stated in this section, because it is obvious that where Congress desired to withhold the privilege, it did so specifically.
Nor do the cases cited by the taxpayer support this result. In the Grobart case no returns were ever filed for the years 1948 and 1949 and the wife of the taxpayer had no income for those years. In 1957 the Internal Revenue Service asserted a deficiency on the basis of a single return and, after the deficiency was assessed, after Grobart had filed a petition *863 for review in the Tax Court, after the case was docketed, and after the Internal Revenue Service had prepared substitute returns for Grobart on an individual basis, Grobart and his wife, on April 30, 1959, attempted to file joint income tax returns for 1948 and 1949. It was held (20 T.C.M. p. 640), "since petitioner, together with his wife, did not timely file joint income tax returns for the years 1948 and 1949, he is not entitled to the split income features of section 12(d) in the tax computation for the years 1948 and 1949."[2]
To reach this result in the Grobart case, there was cited, with approval, certain language of the District Court in Grant v. Rose, supra, wherein the District Judge pointed out that (24 F.2d p. 118):
"There is nothing in the law to prohibit the choice of joint or separate returns according to the result on the taxes to be paid, although husband and wife actually have kept their affairs entirely separate. On the other hand, there is nothing in the act to extend the right of choice beyond the time for making the returns. It is not unreasonable to claim a right to substitute one form of return for the other up to the last day for making returns, but, after that, and especially after the returns have been reviewed and assessments made, there are strong administrative reasons for not permitting the upsetting of the whole basis of calculation."
The statement was made in the context of facts, which showed that the taxpayers had elected to file a joint return and, thereafter, beyond the due date of the return, and without any extension of time or permission so to do, attempted to revoke their election and to file separate returns.
On appeal, the Grant case was affirmed. It is perhaps significant that the Circuit Court of Appeals was more guarded in its statement than the District Court, in that it eliminated any reference to when the right of choice must be exercised, and affirmed the lower court, for the reason that (39 F.2d p. 341):
"The husband and wife having made a single joint return within the time prescribed by law, the Commissioner was fully justified in declining to accept the separate returns made contrary to the ruling above quoted [a 1922 Commissioner's ruling denying the right to file an amended return changing the basis from joint to separate or vice versa] and long after the time prescribed by the statute."
The Mundy case fits the same pattern. There the taxpayer had filed no return and the Commissioner had assessed a deficiency on the basis of a joint return. The wife, however, contested her liability. During the course of the proceeding, the government amended, asserting a new deficiency assessment on an individual return basis. The taxpayer, however, continued to contend that the deficiency should have been computed on the basis of a joint return. The contention received summary treatment in the statement that husband and wife may elect to file a joint return, but (14 T.C.M. p. 1072), "That determination must be exercised by the taxpayers at the time the return if [sic] filed."
Notwithstanding the apparent implication of some of the language they employ, these three cases, on their facts, do not constitute judicial construction of § 6013 and its predecessor sections, which would supply a limitation not written into the Act by Congress that in no event may taxpayers elect, after the due date of a return, to file a joint return. Rather, the cases introduce into *864 § 6013 the principle, founded upon equitable considerations, that if an election has been made and acted upon by the Commissioner, or if, as the result of a failure to file a return, the Commissioner has been required to make an election for the taxpayers (or change an election due to a spouse's valid nonacquiescence), that election may not thereafter be altered. Viewed in the light of the principle that the mere late filing of a return does not nullify it, United States v. De Hardit, 120 F.Supp. 110, 114 (D.C.E.D. Va.1954), aff'd. 224 F.2d 673 (4 Cir., 1955), cert. den. 350 U.S. 863, 76 S.Ct. 105, 100 L.Ed. 765,[3] the cases cited by taxpayer are adverse to her position here, because the taxpayer and her husband elected to file a joint return on July 2, 1956, and that return was accepted and acted upon by the Commissioner. Equitable considerations, as well as the administrative problems of the converse result, indicate that that election is binding on her and may not now be modified.
If not permitted to disavow the joint return on the ground that the election to file the joint return was a legal impossibility, the taxpayer next argues that where she received no income in her own right subject to tax, she should be excused from the payment of interest and penalty arising out of what was admittedly solely her husband's fraud. Legally and equitably, this argument is without merit.
The so-called fraud penalty is, by the language of 26 U.S.C.A. (1958 Ed.) § 6653, an amount "* * * added to the tax * * * equal to 50 percent of the underpayment," as is interest which, by the language of 26 U.S.C.A. (1958 Ed.) § 6654(a), is also "added to the tax * * * at the rate of 6 percent per annum upon the amount of the underpayment." Thus, both penalty and interest become a part of the tax. As to the tax generally, 26 U.S. C.A. (1958 Ed.) § 6013(d) provides that, "if a joint return is made, the tax shall be computed on the aggregate income and the liability with respect to the tax shall be joint and several." (Emphasis supplied)
The Courts of Appeals, which have had occasion to consider the question, have rejected the plea of an innocent spouse who joined in the filing of a joint return, to be relieved of the fraud of a husband, Ginsberg's Estate v. C. I. R., 271 F.2d 511 (5 Cir. 1959); Boyett v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 204 F.2d 205 (5 Cir. 1953); Prokop v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 254 F.2d 544 (7 Cir. 1958); Furnish v. C. I. R., 262 F.2d 727 (9 Cir. 1958); Kann v. Commissioner, 210 F.2d 247 (3 Cir. 1953); cert. den. 347 U.S. 967, 74 S.Ct. 778, 98 L.Ed. 1109 (1954), see also, Howell v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 175 F.2d 240 (6 Cir. 1949). These cases have proceeded on the theory that the penalty for fraud and interest are additions to the tax and, in the case of a joint return, liability for the tax is joint and several, irrespective of the fact that one spouse has neither gross income nor deductions. Of particular significance is the Ginsberg's Estate case where, as in the case at bar, the surviving spouse was innocent of fraud, but, nevertheless, was held liable for the fraud penalty.
There is only one authority to the contrary, Cirillo v. Commissioner, 20 T.C.M. 956 (1961). That case attempts to distinguish, unsuccessfully to me, the authorities above cited, on the ground that they involved joint returns timely filed. 26 U.S.C.A. § 6013(d), supra, fails to provide a ground for such distinction, and the legislative history of the joint and several liability on joint returns aspect of the Internal Revenue Act of *865 1938, the predecessor of § 6013(d), fails to support any such contention.[4]
The Cirillo case is the subject of petitions for review of the decision of the Tax Court of the United States, filed by the taxpayers and the Commissioner, and has been argued, and is awaiting decision, in the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (No. 13,902). Comparison of the memorandum opinion of the Tax Court with the decisions of the Courts of Appeals of the other circuits, including the decision of the Third Circuit in Kann v. Commissioner, supra, indicates no need to delay the decision in the case at bar for the filing of an opinion by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
When viewed on equitable grounds, the taxpayer's contention is also lacking in merit. During her husband's lifetime, it was to the advantage of the taxpayer to join with him in filing a joint return, so as to achieve a splitting of income, a consequent reduction in tax due, and a lesser diminution of assets and income from which her support was derived. It must be noted that, by a splitting of income, there is a consequent reduction in penalty and interest due, since both are computed on the basis of the initial tax. Having sought to avail herself of these advantages, the taxpayer may not complain of their consequences solely on the basis of the intervening death of her husband.

JUDGMENT:
Judgment will be entered for the taxpayer for $43.61, the amount of the stipulated overpayment of interest.
NOTES
[1]  "§ 6013. Joint returns of income tax by husband and wife

"(a) Joint returns.A husband and wife may make a single return jointly of income taxes under subtitle A, even though one of the spouses has neither gross income nor deductions, except as provided below:
"(1) no joint return shall be made if either the husband or wife at any time during the taxable year is a nonresident alien;
"(2) no joint return shall be made if the husband and wife have different taxable years; except that if such taxable years begin on the same day and end on different days because of the death of either or both, then the joint return may be made with respect to the taxable year of each. The above exception shall not apply if the surviving spouse remarries before the close of his taxable year, nor if the taxable year of either spouse is a fractional part of a year under section 443(a) (1);
"(3) in the case of death of one spouse or both spouses the joint return with respect to the decedent may be made only by his executor or administrator; except that in the case of the death of one spouse the joint return may be made by the surviving spouse with respect to both himself and the decedent if no return for the taxable year has been made by the decedent, no executor or administrator has been appointed, and no executor or administrator is appointed before the last day prescribed by law for filing the return of the surviving spouse. If an executor or administrator of the decedent is appointed after the making of the joint return by the surviving spouse, the executor or administrator may disaffirm such joint return by making, within 1 year after the last day prescribed by law for filing the return of the surviving spouse, a separate return for the taxable year of the decedent with respect to which the joint return was made, in which case the return made by the survivor shall constitute the separate return."
[2]  The Grobart case arose under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. The provisions of the statute with regard to the filing of joint returns by husband and wife were substantially the same as those contained in the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
[3]  As the Commissioner points out, in the absence of the special factors present in the authorities cited by the taxpayer, administratively the Act has not been construed to bar an initial election made after the due date of a return. As examples, see Grimes v. Commissioner, 20 T.C.M. 1662 (1961); Finnorn v. Commissioner, 19 T.C.M. 87 (1960); Cirillo v. Commissioner, 20 T.C.M. 956 (1961); Williams v.

"Section 51(b) of the bill expressly provides that the spouses, who exercise the privilege of filing a joint return, are jointly and severally liable for the tax computed upon their aggregate income. It is necessary, for administrative reasons, that any doubt as to the existence of liability should be set at rest, if the privilege of filing such joint returns is continued."
Report of a Subcommittee of the Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, 75th Cong., 3rd Sess., on Proposed Revision of the Revenue Laws, 1938, pp. 49-50:

"In the opinion of your subcommittee the Bureau's position is sound; and to avoid further confusion and litigation it is recommended * * * that an amendment be inserted in the statute to make it clear that if a husband and wife choose to file a joint return, each of them will be liable for the tax on their aggregate income, and for any deficiencies, penalties, and interest in respect of the joint return which may thereafter be determined."

OPINION
POGUE, Judge.
This case involves the proper meaning of the term "tileboard" as used in subheading 4411.19.30 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (1997) ("HTSUS"). Plaintiffs Witex, U.S.A., Inc. and Mannington Mills ("Witex") challenge the United States Customs Service's[1] ("Customs" or "Government") liquidation of its laminated flooring panels ("merchandise" or "flooring panels"), claiming that the merchandise should be liquidated as "tileboard" under heading 4411.19.30, HTSUS, and therefore duty free.[2] The Government avers that Witex's product is not "tileboard" and therefore should be classified under a basket provision for fiberboard with a density greater than 0.8 g/cm,3 and Witex's merchandise should be assessed a duty of 6% ad valorem. See subheading 4411.19.40, HTSUS. Before the Court are cross motions for summary judgment pursuant to USCIT Rule 56. The Court has exclusive jurisdiction over this case. See 28 U.S.C. § 1581(a) (2000). Finding material issues in dispute, the Court denies both motions for summary judgment.


*1313 BACKGROUND
Witex, U.S.A., Inc. is an importer of laminate panels from its parent, Witex GmbH, a German Corporation. Pl.'s Consol. Compl. ("Compli.") at para. 4(a). Mannington Mills, Inc. is a U.S. company which also imports laminate panels from Witex, GmbH. Pl.'s Consol. Compli. at para. 4(b). This case involves a protest by Witex from 1995 covering one entry,[3] and two protests by Mannington Mills from 1996 covering ten entries.[4]
Despite the requirements of USCIT Rule 56, the parties have agreed to few relevant facts. The panels at issue consist of a fiberboard core with a density 0.891 g/cm3, Mem. from Nick Zerebecki, Mannington Mills, to Hao Chen, Mannington Mills, Witex Laminate Products, Ex. 2 to Pl.'s Mem (February 14, 1997) ("Mannington Mem."), Def.'s Statement Additional Material Facts ("Def.'s Statement") at para. 3, and are tongue-and-grooved along their edges and ends.[5] Def.'s Resp. Pl.'s Statement Material Facts at para 1. The tops of the panels are coated with melamine and aluminum oxide, Mannington Mem. at 1, Def.'s Statement at para. 3, and the panels may be used on floors.[6] Pl.'s Mem. at 7 para. 19, Def.'s Statement at para. 1.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENTS
Witex argues that its flooring panels are not fiberboard products and therefore cannot be classified under heading 4411, HTSUS. More specifically, Witex argues that fiberboard, by definition, is limited to unfinished products, whereas its merchandise is finished. Pl.'s Mem. at 11-14, Pl.'s Resp. at 4, Pl.'s Reply in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. ("Pl.'s Reply") at 4. Alternatively, *1314 Witex asks the Court to consider the arguments made in a companion case, Faus Group, Inc. v. United States, slip op. 04-143 (CIT Nov. 15, 2004), that the flooring panels are properly classified under heading 4418, HTSUS, covering "[b]uilders' joinery and carpentry of wood." Pl.'s Mem. at 25, Pl.'s Resp. at 19-20, Pl.'s Reply at 14-15.[7]
If the merchandise is properly classified in heading 4411, HTSUS, Witex claims that it should be classified under subheading 4411.19.30, HTSUS, which covers "[t]ileboard which has been continuously worked along any of its edges and is dedicated for use in the construction of walls, ceilings or other parts of buildings." Pl.'s Mem. at 14-24, Pl.'s Resp. at 6-18, Pl.'s Reply at 1-13. Witex maintains that Customs unduly restricted the scope of subheading 4411.19.30, HTSUS, by requiring that the panels be used on walls. Pl.'s Mem. at 16, Pl.'s Resp. at 7, Pl.'s Reply at 2-3.
The Government argues that the merchandise is classifiable under heading 4411, HTSUS. The Government asserts that Witex relies on a commercial definition of fiberboard used in Europe to support its contention that fiberboard can only be unfinished. Def.'s Mem. at 25-26. That European commercial definition, the Government contends, is irrelevant to the classification of products under the HTSUS. Id. In defining "tileboard," the Government points to the legislative history of the "tileboard" provision which includes a letter from J.J. Barker Co. to the Trade Policy Staff Committee seeking a provision for its imports. Def.'s Mem. at 11-13, 18, 20, Def.'s Reply at 8. According to the Government, J.J. Barker Co. had been importing its "tileboard" product duty free under the Tariff Schedule of the United States ("TSUS"), but was facing a 6% ad valorem duty with the transition to the HTSUS. Def.'s Mem. at 11-13; see also subheading 4411.19.40, HTSUS. Therefore, in order to ensure that J.J. Barker's "tileboard" imports did not face an increase in duty, the "tileboard" provision was added. Id. As the Government argues, because Witex's merchandise is not similar to J.J. Barker's "tileboard," Witex's merchandise cannot be considered "tileboard" within the meaning of subheading 4411.19.30, HTSUS. Id. The Government further argues that based on a dictionary definition of "tileboard," Def.'s Mem. at 16, 18, evidence from industry practice, Def.'s Mem. 17, 22, Def.'s Reply at 8-9, and the Government's expert witness, Def.'s Mem. at 21, Witex's panels are not "tileboard" because "tileboard: (i) is not laminated, (ii) is usually embossed with a pattern, and (iii) is coated with an epoxy or other [liquid] finish to resemble ceramic tile," Def.'s Mem. at 20-21 (brackets around "liquid" in original), (iv) is water-resistant, Def.'s Mem. at 17, 19-20, and (v) is only used on walls, Def.'s Mem. at 21. *1315 Accordingly, the Government claims that because Witex's merchandise is laminated, is not embossed, does not look like ceramic tile, Def.'s Mem. at 20, is not water-resistant, Def.'s Mem. at 19-20, and is used as flooring, not wallboard, Def.'s Mem. 14 n. 14, 22, it cannot be "tileboard." Therefore, the Government argues, Witex's product is excluded from subheading 4411.19.30, HTSUS, rendering it classifiable under 4411.19.40, HTSUS, covering "[o]ther" forms of fiberboard with a density of greater than 0.8 g/cm3 which are surfaced coated by more than oil.

STANDARD OF REVIEW
"The proper scope and meaning of a tariff classification term is a question of law ... while determining whether the goods at issue fall within a particular tariff term as properly construed is a question of fact." Franklin v. United States, 289 F.3d 753, 757 (Fed.Cir.2002) (citations omitted). A Customs' classification ruling is subject to de novo review[8] as to the meaning of the tariff provision, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2640, but may be accorded a "respect proportional to its `power to persuade.'" United States v. Mead, 533 U.S. 218, 235, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001) (quoting Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944)).
Both parties have moved for summary judgment pursuant to USCIT Rule 56. Summary judgment is only appropriate "if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." USCIT R. 56(c) (emphasis added). Material issues only arise concerning "facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Consequently, in classification cases, genuine issues of material fact only arise when there is a dispute over the use, characteristics, or properties of the merchandise being classified, Brother Int'l Corp. v. United States, 26 CIT ___, ___, 248 F.Supp.2d 1224, 1226 (2002), or where commercial meaning is in question. Russell Stadelman & Co. v. United States, 242 F.3d 1044, 1048 (Fed.Cir.2001). For the reasons set forth below, summary judgment for either party at this point is not warranted.

DISCUSSION
"The proper classification of merchandise entering the United States is directed by the General Rules of Interpretation (`GRIs') of the HTSUS and the Additional United States Rules of Interpretation." Orlando Food Corp. v. United States, 140 F.3d 1437, 1439 (Fed.Cir.1998). The HTSUS is organized by headings setting forth general categories of merchandise; below each heading are listed subheadings (and then further subdivisions) that more specifically describe products within each heading. Id. According to the GRIs, a Court must choose the most appropriate heading, and then, "[o]nly after determining that a product is classifiable under the heading should the court look to the subheadings to find the correct classification for the merchandise." Id. at 1440 (citing GRI 1, 6, HTSUS). Once the Court chooses the proper heading, the Court is limited to choosing a subheading only from within *1316 the proper heading, i.e., the subheadings appearing under other headings become irrelevant for the classification of the merchandise at issue. Id.
Because there is a dispute as to the proper heading, the Court will first determine whether the flooring panels are properly classified under heading 4411, HTSUS. After finding that the merchandise is properly classifiable under heading 4411, HTSUS, the Court will construe subheading 4411.19.30, HTSUS, ultimately concluding that material issues remain to be resolved.

I. Choosing the Proper Heading
A. Meaning of Fiberboard
As required by GRI 1, HTSUS, "classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes...." Heading 4411, HTSUS, covers "[f]iberboard of wood or other ligneous materials, whether or not bonded with resins or other organic substances." Both parties concede that the merchandise is made with a fiberboard core. Pl.'s Statement Undisputed Facts Supp. Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. at para. 2, Def.'s Statement at para. 1. Fiberboard is defined as "[a] general term that refers to any of various panel products such as particleboard, hardboard, chipboard, or other type formed by bonding wood fibers by heat and pressure." Terms of the Trade 130 (4th ed.2000); see also Webster's II New Riverside University Dictionary 474 (1988) ("[a] building material made of plant fibers, as wood, bonded together and compressed into rigid sheets."). These definitions do not define "fiberboard" by any element of its finish.
Witex contends that Customs wrongfully classified its merchandise under heading 4411, HTSUS, because fiberboard includes only unfinished merchandise whereas Witex's merchandise is finished. To support is contention, Witex introduces a letter from the European Producers of Laminate Flooring ("EPLF") stating that "[f]rom an industry perspective ... [l]aminate panelling, which is widely used in the industry for both wall and floor applications, cannot be fibreboard because, by definition, fibreboard is a component of some types of laminate and, at most, can be considered unfinished laminate." Letter from Peter H. Meyer, Managing Director of the European Producers of Laminate Flooring, to Bruce Aitken, Esq., Ex. 12 to Pl.'s Mem. at 12 (Feb. 28, 2002) ("EPLF Letter").[9] Witex also cites the Deposition of Paul Garetto, a National Import Specialist, as saying: "If you asked for fiberboard, if you go to a lumberyard, probably they would direct you to a 4 by 8 sheet of fiberboard, probably unfinished." Dep. Paul Garetto, Ex. 14 to Pl.'s Mem. at 118 (Jan. 15.2004).[10] According to Witex's logic, because "fiberboard" is by definition unfinished, and because Witex's product is finished, the merchandise cannot be "fiberboard." *1317 Pl.'s Mem. at 12-14. Essentially, what Witex's argument boils down to is that there is a commercial meaning of "fiberboard" which precludes the classification of its merchandise under heading 4411, HTSUS. Witex's argument is unpersuasive for two reasons: (1) Witex has failed to establish a commercial meaning for the proposition it seeks; and (2) even if Witex were correct as to the meaning of "fiberboard," Witex reads the word "fiberboard" out of context with the rest of the tariff provision.
First, Witex fails to establish a commercial meaning for its merchandise. Witex is correct in claiming that an established commercial meaning prevails over a common meaning unless contrary to Congressional intent. See Maddock v. Magone, 152 U.S. 368, 371, 14 S.Ct. 588, 38 L.Ed. 482 (1894) (citing Cadwalader v. Zeh, 151 U.S. 171, 176, 14 S.Ct. 288, 38 L.Ed. 115 (1894)). However, in order to establish a commercial meaning, the party invoking a commercial meaning has the burden of proving that a term has a commercial meaning that is "definite, uniform, and general throughout the trade," Carl Zeiss, Inc. v. United States, 195 F.3d 1375, 1379 (Fed.Cir.1999), and that this "definite, uniform, and general meaning" is used in the United States' trade and commerce, Two Hundred Chests of Tea, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat) 430, 438, 6 L.Ed. 128 (1824) ("Whether a particular article were designated by one name or another, in the country of its origin ... was of no importance in the view of the legislature."), Wing Coffee Co., Ltd. v. United States, 53 Cust.Ct. 60, 63 (1964). Accordingly, "in considering the commercial designation of a tariff term, only commercial use of that term in the United States is relevant." Russell Stadelman & Co. v. United States, 242 F.3d 1044, 1049 (Fed.Cir.2001) (emphasis added).
The evidence proffered by Witex fails to meet the burden of proof for establishing a commercial meaning in this case. A letter from a single European trade association, that represents only producers of laminate flooring,[11] does not provide any evidence of a definite, general, and uniform meaning of a term as used in the United States. Nor is Witex's claim supported by the Deposition of Paul Garretto. The Deposition of Paul Garretto merely establishes that if a person asked for fiberboard at a lumberyard, they "probably" would be directed to unfinished fiberboard. This does not constitute evidence that if fiberboard is finished it is no longer fiberboard. Because Witex has failed to adduce any probative evidence for a "definite, uniform, and general" commercial meaning for "fiberboard," the Court is bound by the common meaning of fiberboard as that term appears in heading 4411, HTSUS.[12]
Secondly, Witex's reading of heading 4411, HTSUS, is belied by the language of the heading, chapter notes, and the Explanatory Notes. Heading 4411, HTSUS, is an eo nomine provision as it "describes a commodity by a specific name." Am. Hardboard Ass'n v. United States, 12 CIT 714, 715 (1988); see also JVC Co. of Am. v. United States, 234 F.3d *1318 1348, 1352 (Fed.Cir.2000). Because eo nomine "provision[s] include[ ] all forms of the named article unless limited by [their] terms," Am. Hardboard, "[a]n improvement in merchandise provided for eo nomine does not remove it from classification under the eo nomine designation." Arthur J. Humphreys, Inc. v. United States, 973 F.2d 1554, 1556 (1992). Consequently, when an eo nomine provision is used as it is in heading 4411, HTSUS, the tariff term implicitly means fiberboard and products made from fiberboard.[13] Therefore, even if a piece of fiberboard has been further worked beyond its raw form, it still remains classifiable under heading 4411, HTSUS.
The drafters of the HTSUS, and Congress, recognized that heading 4411, HTSUS, includes fiberboard products that have been further worked through the inclusion of Chapter Note 4 to Chapter 44 which provides that "[p]roducts of heading 4410, 4411, or 4412 may be worked to form the shapes provided for in respect of articles of heading 4409, curved, corrugated, perforated, cut or formed to shapes other than square or rectangular or submitted to any other operation provided it does not give them the character of articles of other headings." Chapter Note 4 to Chapter 44, HTSUS.[14] Chapter Note 4 admits that fiberboard products transformed beyond their raw character are nonetheless still classifiable under heading 4411, HTSUS, unless subjected to an operation, not among those enumerated, that gives the product the character of an article in another heading. The Explanatory Note to 44.11 further specifies that "[i]mpregnating or other agents may also be added during or after manufacture of the board to give an extra property, e.g., impermeability to water or resistance to rot, insect attack, fire or the spread of flame." Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, Explanatory Note 44.11 (2nd ed.1996) at 680 ("Explanatory Notes" or "EN"); cf. Chapter 44, U.S. Note 1(c), HTSUS. Last, the subheadings under heading 4411, HTSUS, include products such as "tileboard," subheading 4411.19.30, HTSUS, and "[l]aminated boards bonded in whole or in part, or impregnated, with synthetic resins," subheading 4411.29.20, HTSUS. Witex's reading of heading 4411, HTSUS, to preclude classification of its laminated paneling therein, would render nugatory the above referenced provisions, in violation of the well-established rule of statutory construction that all parts of a statute should be given effect if possible. See Weinberger v. Hynson, Westcott & Dunning, Inc., 412 U.S. 609, 633, 93 S.Ct. 2469, 37 L.Ed.2d 207 (1973). Therefore, the text and Explanatory Notes demonstrate a clear Congressional intent not to use the restrictive definition of "fiberboard" advanced by Witex. Accordingly, even if Witex could prove its commercial meaning of "fiberboard," there is a clear indication that Congress did not intend Witex's claimed commercial meaning. See Cadwalader v. Zeh, 151 U.S. 171, 176, 14 S.Ct. 288, 38 L.Ed. 115 (1894) (the "commercial meaning is to prevail, unless Congress *1319 has clearly manifested a contrary intention.").
B. Other possible headings
Alternatively, Witex asks the Court to choose another appropriate heading, referencing the dispute before the Court in Faus Group, Inc. v. United States, ___ F.Supp.2d ___, 2004 WL 2595876 (CIT Nov. 15, 2004), which deals with heading 4418, HTSUS, covering "[b]uilders' joinery and carpentry of wood." Pl.'s Mem. at 25. In Faus Group, ___ F.Supp.2d ___, 2004 WL 2595876 (CIT Nov. 15, 2004), the Court found that nearly identical laminated flooring panels were properly classifiable under heading 4411, HTSUS, and not under heading 4418, HTSUS. Because Witex does not present any arguments or evidence that would distinguish its merchandise from the merchandise in Faus Group, the Court deems that Witex's flooring panels are likewise classifiable under heading 4411, HTSUS, for the reasons set forth in Faus Group.
C. Heading 4411, HTSUS, is the proper heading
Because Witex's merchandise is classifiable under heading 4411, HTSUS, and there are no other appropriate headings under which its merchandise would fall, heading 4411, HTSUS, is the proper heading for Witex's flooring panels.

II. Choosing the Proper Subheading
Finding that Witex's flooring panels are properly classified under heading 4411, HTSUS, the Court next addresses under which subheading the merchandise falls. Both parties agree that, if the merchandise falls under heading 4411, HTSUS, the merchandise either falls under subheading 4411.19.30, HTSUS, for "[t]ileboard which has been continuously worked along any of its edges and is dedicated for use in the construction of walls, ceilings, or other parts of building," or subheading 4411.19.40, covering all "other" fiberboard products with densities greater than 0.8 g/cm3 which are surface covered by more than an oil treatment.[15] Because subheading 4411.19.40, HTSUS, is a basket provision, i.e., covering all products not classifiable elsewhere,[16] the flooring panels are only classifiable in subheading 4411.19.40, HTSUS, if they are not classifiable under subheading 4411.19.30, HTSUS. See Rollerblade, Inc. v. United States, 282 F.3d 1349, 1354 (Fed.Cir.2002) (citing EM Indus., *1320 Inc. v. United States, 22 CIT 156, 165, 999 F.Supp. 1473, 1480 (1998)). Consequently, this case hinges on the meaning of subheading 4411.19.30, HTSUS.
Subheading 4411.19.30, HTSUS, covers "[t]ileboard which has been continuously worked along any of its edges and is dedicated for use in the construction of walls, ceilings, or other parts of buildings." Subheading 4411.19.30, HTSUS. The language of the subheading requires a product to exhibit three features: (1) it must be "tileboard"; (2) which has been continuously worked along any of its edges; and (3) is dedicated for use in the construction of walls, ceilings or other parts of buildings. Both parties essentially agree that Witex's flooring panels satisfy the last two prongs of the test: the panels are tongue-and-grooved along their edges, satisfying the second prong; moreover, the panels are used on "floors" which may be included within the meaning of "other parts of buildings."[17] However, the parties do not agree on the meaning of the word "tileboard." Consequently, the Court must define "tileboard" to determine whether the flooring panels can be classified under subheading 4411.19.30, HTSUS.
A. The Legislative History
"The first step in properly construing a tariff classification term is to determine whether Congress clearly defined that term in either the HTSUS or its legislative history." Russell Stadelman & Co. v. United States, 242 F.3d 1044, 1048 (Fed.Cir.2001) (emphasis added). "Tileboard" is not defined in the HTSUS; however, both the Customs' Ruling, Headquarters Ruling ("HQ") 960084 (December 10, 1997), and the Government in this case have suggested that "tileboard" is defined by the legislative history of subheading 4411.19.30, HTSUS.
In 1989, as part of an international effort to adopt a common nomenclature across nations, see Carl Zeiss, Inc. v. United States, 195 F.3d 1375, 1378 n. 1 (Fed.Cir.1999), the United States agreed to adopt the headings and subheadings (up to the six digit level) established under the international Harmonized Schedule, but reserved the right to create further subdivisions beyond the six digit level, see International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Article 3(3) found at http:// www.wcoomd.o rg/ie/En/Conventions/conventions.html.[18] Before the transition to *1321 the HTSUS became fully effective, J.J. Barker, Co. ("J.J.Barker"), an importer of "tileboard," alerted the Trade Policy Staff Committee ("TPSC")[19] that although its imports of paneling were duty free under the TSUS, under the proposed HTSUS J.J. Barker's product would face a 6% ad valorem duty rate. See Letter from S.C. Gauthier to Christopher P. Marcich, Director of Tariff Affairs, Ex. D to Def.'s Mem. (Jan. 8, 1988) ("Barker Letter"). According to the Government, the TPSC responded by adding subheading 4411.19.30, HTSUS, in order to maintain duty free treatment for J.J. Barker's imports. Def.'s Mem. at 11-14. According to the Government, because J.J. Barker's product was referred to as "tileboard," the Court should look to that product as a model for what constitutes "tileboard" within the meaning of subheading 4411.19.30, HTSUS. See Def.'s Mem. at 12-13. The Government, gleaning its information from a product brochure, Easy Living  With Barker, Ex. E to Def.'s Mem., describes "tileboard" as "completely water resistant decorative wall panels made of non-laminated hardboard with a density of 1.15 g/cm3 with their surface painted, coated and grooved to imitate individual ceramic tiles." Def.'s Mem. at 12.
The letter from J.J. Barker cited by the Government, however, is of dubious probative value and does not provide a definite or express definition of "tileboard." As the Supreme Court has noted:
Legislative history is problematic even when the attempt is to draw inferences from the intent of duly appointed committees of the Congress. It becomes far more so when we consult sources still more steps removed from the full Congress and speculate upon the significance of the fact that a certain interest group sponsored or opposed particular legislation. We ought not attribute to Congress an official purpose based on the motives of a particular group that lobbied for or against a certain proposal  even assuming the precise intent of the group can be determined....
Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U.S. 105, 120, 121 S.Ct. 1302, 149 L.Ed.2d 234 (2001) (citations omitted). Similarly, the court in United States v. Paramount Publix Corp., 22 C.C.P.A. 452, 460 (1934) found that committee testimony of interested parties was not "controlling since the enactment of the provision in the language before us might have been with an intent wholly different from that indicated by the witnesses." This problem is particularly acute here where there is no indication of how the TPSC, or Congress, defined "tileboard" in relation to J.J. Barker's product.[20] Therefore, this history does not *1322 provide the Court with a definite or express definition of "tileboard."[21]
Consequently, because the legislative history is of a non-dispositive nature, this case cannot be resolved by looking first to the legislative history for a definition. This does not mean that the Court deems the legislative history irrelevant for future use to bolster a definition; it simply means that at this juncture, the instant case cannot be resolved by recourse to the legislative history.
B. Commercial Meaning
When the HTSUS or legislative history do not define a term, the Court looks to the term's common or commercial meaning. Both parties have suggested that there is a commercial meaning for the term "tileboard."[22] Because a commercial designation, once proven, takes precedence over a common meaning, see Boen Hardwood Flooring, Inc. v. United States, 357 F.3d 1262, 1265 (Fed.Cir.2004), it is appropriate to determine if either party has established, or can establish, a commercial *1323 meaning. Cf. Cadwalader v. Zeh, 151 U.S. 171, 176, 14 S.Ct. 288, 38 L.Ed. 115 (1894) ("it is only when no commercial meaning is called for or proved, that the common meaning of the words is to be adopted"). Proof of a commercial meaning is a matter of fact, not law. Russell Stadelman & Co. v. United States, 242 F.3d 1044, 1048 (Fed.Cir.2001); but cf. Boen, 357 F.3d at 1265.
As this Court has long maintained, the rule of commercial designation is "intended to apply to cases where the trade designation is so universal and well understood that the Congress, and all the trade, are supposed to have been fully acquainted with the practice at the time the law was enacted." Jas. Akeroyd & Co. v. United States, 15 Ct. Cust.App. 440, 443 (1928). Accordingly, to establish a commercial meaning, a party must prove that "tileboard" has a commercial meaning in the trade "which is general (extending over the entire country), definite (certain of understanding), and uniform (the same everywhere in the country)." Rohm & Haas Co. v. United States, 5 CIT 218, 226, 568 F.Supp. 751, 757 (1983) (citations omitted). "The commercial meaning of tariff terms must be proved by persons engaged in buying and selling the merchandise at wholesale in the United States, or by persons who know, by their own experience or of their own knowledge, the meaning of the designation applied to the merchandise by those who buy and sell it at wholesale."[23]Rice Millers' Ass'n v. United States, 15 U.S.Cust.App. 355, 360 (1928). Moreover, mere negative inference that a product is excluded from a commercial designation is insufficient; rather, a party must offer positive evidence of the actual meaning of the commercial designation. United States v. Fung Chong Co., 34 C.C.P.A. 40, 44 (1946); Carl Zeiss, Inc. v. United States, 22 CIT 606, 610-11, 16 F.Supp.2d 1097, 1101 (1998). Last, minus a clear statement of commercial practice, Boen, 357 F.3d at 1265, testimony by witnesses is an indispensable tool in establishing a commercial meaning. See, e.g., Passaic Worsted Co. v. United States, 17 C.C.P.A. 459, 461-62 (1930); Rice Millers', 15 Ct. Cust.App. at 360. Both parties' evidence fails to meet these standards.[24]
*1324 Ordinarily, upon the failure of a party, or parties, to establish a commercial designation, the Court will find that there is no commercial meaning and turn to the common meaning of the tariff term. However, it appears premature to entirely reject the possibility that "tileboard" does have a commercial meaning in this case. Rather, what "evidence" has been offered as to commercial meaning has not been sufficiently developed to determine if there is a commercial meaning, and if there is, what exactly that commercial meaning is.
First, both parties agree that the American Hardboard Association ("AHA") does have a commercial designation for "tileboard." In fact, at least two Customs Rulings have relied, at least in part, on the AHA's commercial definition(s) of "tileboard." HQ 960084 at 4; HQ 085913 at 2 (January 8, 1990). However, neither party has offered testimonial evidence to this effect, and what evidence they have produced is confusing.[25] Because the sources *1325 cited by the parties do suggest that the AHA does have a commercial designation, testimony is required to determine to which, if any, of these definitions the AHA subscribes.[26]
Second, evidence from industry practice, suggests that the industry may define "tileboard" differently from common sources. For example, the Terms of the Trade specifies that "tileboard" is "[a] hardboard panel that has been embossed with a pattern and then coated with epoxy. The resulting product is designed to look like ceramic tile, for use in kitchens, bathrooms, etc." Def.'s Mem. at 16 (citing Terms of the Trade 280 (3rd ed.1993)).[27] Using this definition, the Government deduces that "tileboard" must have an appearance of ceramic tile. Def.'s Mem. at 20-21. However, the Government also cites literature from ABT Co., the manufacturer of AquaTile(R) Embossed Tileboard, claiming that ABT Co.'s Tileboard has "the look of fine tile and marble." *1326 Def.'s Mem. at 17. Moreover, in HQ 085913, discussing Plywood Panels Inc.'s "tileboard," Customs refers to a definition of "tileboard" provided by the AHA as requiring "tileboard" to have a ceramic tile or marble appearance. HQ 085913 at 1 (January 8, 1990).[28] Plywood Panels Inc.'s "tileboard" likewise has a "ceramic or marble" appearance. Id., Def.'s Mem. at 13 n. 13. Depending on how one defines "designed to look like ceramic tile," ABT Co.'s and Plywood Panels Inc.'s products would not be "tileboard" because of their marble appearance. In other words, products the Government uses as evidence of "tileboard" would in fact not be "tileboard." Although the evidence from manufacturers is of questionable probative value, when joined with the purported AHA definition, this evidence leads the Court to believe that there may be a commercial definition of "tileboard" that deviates from the common meaning.
Because the parties have not adequately supported their proffered commercial definitions of "tileboard" despite the fact that a commercial designation seems probable, it is impossible for the Court to exclude the possibility of a commercial designation and arrive at the proper construction of subheading 4411.19.30, HTSUS.[29] However, because of the Court's duty to determine the correct meaning of tariff terms, see Jarvis Clark Co. v. United States, 733 F.2d 873, 878 (Fed.Cir.1984), Congress vested the Court of International Trade with broad discretionary powers necessary to resolve cases like this. See 28 U.S.C. § 2643. Specifically, 28 U.S.C. § 2643(b) provides that:
If the Court of International Trade is unable to determine the correct decision on the basis of the evidence presented in any civil action, the court may order a retrial or rehearing for all purposes, or may order such further administrative or adjudicative procedures as the court considers necessary to enable it to reach the correct decision.
28 U.S.C. § 2643 (emphasis added). In addition, USCIT Rule 56(d) authorizes the Court, in this situation, to "direct[] such further proceedings in the action as are just." Therefore, in accordance with its duty to determine the correct meaning of "tileboard," the Court finds that summary judgment is not appropriate at this time and orders the parties to prepare an order governing preparation for trial.


*1327 CONCLUSION
Because the Court finds the record insufficient to establish a commercial designation for the term "tileboard," or exclude the possibility thereof, the cross motions for summary judgment are denied. The parties shall jointly prepare an order governing preparation for trial and submit it to the Court by December 15, 2004.
It is so ORDERED

[4]  As stated by Witex's Complaint, the Mannington challenges involve (1) Ruling on Protest No. 1001-99-105507 covering Entry Nos. D82-0981523, D82-0981640, D82-0981765, D82-0981788, D82-0981856, and D82-0981985 and (2) Ruling on Protest No. 1001-99-105508 covering Entry Nos.

Because Witex did not include Entry No. XX-XXXXXXX within its Summons, Summons Witex at 1 (Feb. 13, 1998), this entry is not properly before the Court, Pl.'s Answers Ct.'s Questions Pursuant Order Dated Sept. 20, 2004 at 1.
[5]  The Court notes the Government's objection as to whether Witex has sufficiently proved the identity of its merchandise, i.e., to which type of panels, or from what collection, the contested merchandise belonged. Def.'s Reply at 4 n. 18. The cases the Government cites, Group Italglass, U.S.A., Inc. v. United States, 16 CIT 763, 765, 798 F.Supp. 727, 728 (1992) and Fabil Mfg. Corp. v. United States, 25 CIT 514, 517, 2001 WL 576156 (2001) (quoting Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)), do establish that the burden of proof is on the plaintiff in establishing the identity of the actual imports. However, because "tileboard" remains defined at this stage only in the most general terms, see infra at 20-34, i.e., "tileboard" includes any product of a density greater than 0.8 g/cm3 used on walls, ceilings, or other parts of buildings, and both parties agree to the facts at this level of generality, summary judgment on the basis of Witex's failure to meet its burden is premature at this time. The Court does note that once a definition is established, Witex will bear the burden of proof concerning the identity of its merchandise. For example, if it is established that "tileboard" must look like ceramic tile, and if Witex does not know which entries, if any, have this pattern, Witex will fail to meet its burden of proof.
[6]  By using the term "use", the Court is not implying that this is the only, or principle, use of the panels. Rather, the Court is merely recognizing that both parties agree that the panels are used on floors.
[7]  The Government asks the Court not to consider this issue because Witex did not specifically brief it in this case. Def.'s Reply at 12, Def.'s Resps. Ct.'s Questions Prior Oral Argument on the Parties' Cross-Mot. for Summ. J. at 9. As the Government maintains: "Taken literally, a mandate to `find the correct result' would require a court to conduct its own analysis of imported merchandise and scour the tariff statute to ensure that all possible provisions have been considered. Indeed, this appears to be precisely what Witex is suggesting." Def.'s Reply at 12. Despite this, the Government also asks the Court to find that Boen Hardwood Flooring, Inc. v. United States, 357 F.3d 1262 (Fed.Cir.2004) controls this case insofar as it concerns the potential classification of the merchandise under heading 4418, HTSUS. See, e.g., Def.'s Mem. Supp. Cross-Motion Summ. J. ("Def.'s Mem.") at 29. However, Boen Hardwood Flooring did not decide this issue, and heading 4418, HTSUS, was never argued by the parties, at least at the trial court level. The Government cannot have it both ways.
[8]  Witex occasionally appears to suggest that Customs Rulings are reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. See, e.g., Pl.'s Resp. at 9-10, Pl.'s Reply at 4-5. In classification cases, Witex must show that its product is "tileboard" under some definition of "tileboard." Even if the Government's definition is wrong, that does not by itself make a product "tileboard," nor does it resolve the case, for then the Court must define the term "tileboard." See Jarvis Clark Co. v. United States, 733 F.2d 873, 878 (Fed.Cir.1984).
[9]  The Court does not know what is meant by "unfinished laminate," i.e., whether "unfinished laminate" means that fiberboard must undergo further operations to become a finished laminate flooring panel, or whether it means that the fiberboard has not been surface coated with a finish. However, this ambiguity is immaterial for the reasons set forth below.
[10]  Witex suggests that Paul Garetto's testimony represents the "common meaning" of "fiberboard." Pl.'s Mem. at 13-14. Because the determination of common meaning is a question of law, Schott Optical Glass, Inc. v. United States, 67 C.C.P.A. 32, 34, 612 F.2d 1283, 1285 (1979), and the common meaning of a word should be readily obtainable to all persons who do not have specialized knowledge, testimony regarding a common meaning is considered only advisory. See Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. v. United States, 7 CIT 178, 183-84, 585 F.Supp. 649, 654 (1984).
[11]  Witex also cites the European Committee for Standardization's definition of fiberboard: "panel material with a nominal thickness of 1.5 mm or greater, manufactured from lignocellulosic fibers with application of heat and/or pressure." Pl.'s Mem. at 13. If this definition were relevant, it would still not support Witex's contention because it does not impose any requirement that fiberboard be "unfinished."
[12]  Just because the Court rejects the notion that fiberboard has a commercial meaning in the manner suggested by Witex does not mean that other terms under heading 4411, HTSUS, do not have commercial meanings. See infra at 1322-26.
[13]  Chapter Note 4 to Chapter 44, HTSUS, mandates that there is a point where the product has been sufficiently advanced such that it no longer falls within the eo nomine designation. However, the Court rejected in Faus Group, Inc. v. United States, 2004 WL 2595876(CIT Nov. 15, 2004) the argument that surface covering and tongue-and-grooving fiberboard were sufficient to remove a product from heading 4411, HTSUS.

This reading is also consistent with the North American Laminate Flooring Association's definition of fiberboard which recognizes that "fiberboard" is a "core material." See North American Laminate Flooring Association, Laminate Flooring, Ex. 6 to Pl.'s Mem. at 2.
[14]  For a thorough discussion of Note 4 to Chapter 44, see Faus Group, Inc. v. United States, 2004 WL 2595876 (CIT Nov. 15, 2004).
[15]  There are three categories of subheadings under heading 4411, HTSUS, differentiating products on the basis of the density of the fiberboard product: (1) subheadings 4411.11  4411.19, HTSUS, covering fiberboard products with densities of greater than 0.8 g/cm3; (2) subheadings 4411.21  4411.29, HTSUS, covering fiberboard products with densities exceeding 0.5 g/cm3 but not exceeding 0.8 g/cm3 and; (3) subheadings 4411.31  4411.99, HTSUS, covering fiberboard with density of less than 0.5 g/cm3. Because Witex's flooring panels have a density of greater than 0.8 g/cm3, they fall within the first category of goods. This category is further divided as to whether the merchandise has been "mechanically worked or surface covered" where surface covered "means that one or more exterior surfaces of a product have been ... overlaid with paper...." Chapter 44, U.S. Note 1(c), HTSUS. Witex's flooring panels are overlaid with a color photograph of wood and are therefore "surface covered." This subdivision is further subdivided for products that have not been "surface covered (except for oil treatment)" which does not include Witex's merchandise because of the paper overlay.
[16]  Witex appears confused by what is meant by a "basket provision." See Pl.'s Mem. at 11. Classifying a product in a "basket provision" does not mean that a product is "unfinished." A "basket provision" is simply used to classify products not classifiable elsewhere. In fact, to be classified under subheading 4411.19.40, HTSUS, a product must be mechanically worked and surface coated by more than just oil which makes products classifiable there far from "unfinished."
[17]  The Court agrees that "other parts of buildings" may include floors. However, because "other parts of buildings" may include floors, it does not necessarily follow that "other parts of buildings" must include floors. Rather, the "other parts of buildings" modifies "tileboard." In other words, this language means "other parts of buildings" where "tileboard" is used  if "tileboard" is not used on floors, then floors are not another part of a building where "tileboard" is used. Because ejusdem generis is only applicable where legislative intent is unclear, see 2A Norman J. Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction § 47.18 at 287-88 (6th ed.2000), if the Government can establish that the clear meaning of "tileboard" requires principle use on walls, then "other parts of buildings" cannot be read to enlarge the definition of "tileboard." As a brief aside, the phrase "wall, ceilings and other parts of buildings" was employed by the TSUS in defining "building boards." See Headnote 1(e) of Part 3 of Schedule 2 TSUS (1987). Neither of the two cases evaluating this term, Am. Hardboard Ass'n v. United States, 12 CIT 714 (1988), F.W. Myers & Co., Inc. v. United States, 59 Cust.Ct. 427, 275 F.Supp. 811 (1967), appear to lend assistance to the inquiry here.
[18]  The "tileboard" classification is beyond the six-digit level, and each nation is allowed to create its own subdivisions beyond the six-digit level. How Europe classifies these goods is therefore irrelevant when considering how the United States should classify goods at this level unless a party can show that the creation of the U.S. provision was influenced by the European nomenclature.
[19]  The TPSC was responsible for converting the TSUS to the HTSUS. The TPSC solicited public comment for the express purpose of "[a]void[ing], to the extent practicable and consonant with sound nomenclature principles, changes in rates of duty on individual products." Public Hearings on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, 48 Fed.Reg. 34,822, 34,823 (USTR Aug. 1, 1982).
[20]  In its letter to the TPSC, J.J. Barker only described its product as "finished hardboard" of "high quality, high priced `tileboard' bath and kitchen panels." Barker Letter, Ex. D to Def.'s Mem. at 1. (Note that: (a) the letter describes the merchandise not just as "tileboard," but a certain type of "tileboard"  i.e., "high quality, high priced `tileboard'" and (b) J.J. Barker also felt it was necessary to mention that its product was used in the bath and kitchen, an unnecessary defining feature if the only use of "tileboard" was in the bath and kitchen.) J.J. Barker appended a classification ruling from 1971 that described the product as "hardboard wall panels which are coated with melamine" which were bull-nosed, or rounded, along their vertical edges. Id. at 4; cf. with the Government's description, Def.'s Mem. at 12 (J.J. Barker's product was "completely water resistant decorative wall panels made of non-laminated hardboard with a density of 1.15 g/cm3 with their surface painted, coated and grooved to imitate individual ceramic tiles."). It is not clear upon which, if any, of these descriptions, the TPSC based its definition of "tileboard." Moreover, even if the Court were to adopt any of these descriptions, it would be impossible to determine what are the essential characteristics of "tileboard" on the basis of one product. For example, if a product matched the Government's proffered description, but it was only 1.1 g/cm3 in density, or if the product imitated marble rather than ceramic tiles, would it still be "tileboard"? Nonetheless, this evidence is not completely valueless. For instance, if Customs sought to classify products in a way that would exclude J.J. Barker's product from subheading 4411.19.30, HTSUS, this evidence may be probative.
[21]  When the legislative history provides a clear or express definition of a tariff term, the Court will rely on that definition. For example, courts have used definitions in reports prepared in conjunction with the drafting of the tariff provision, see e.g., Arthur J. Humphreys, Inc. v. United States, 973 F.2d 1554, 1557 (Fed.Cir.1992), or judicially established definitions of the same term used in an earlier version of the tariff schedule, see e.g., Intercontinental Marble Corp. v. United States, 381 F.3d 1169, 1175-76 (Fed.Cir.2004) (using the commercial definition of marble as established under the TSUS when interpreting that term in the HTSUS). However, absent a clear or express definition provided by the legislative history, definitions gleaned from the legislative history are merely probative and are used to bolster or support a definition derived from dictionaries, lexicons, scientific authorities, and other such reliable sources. Cf., Anhydrides & Chems., Inc. v. United States, 130 F.3d 1481 (Fed.Cir.1997).
[22]  The Court has been able to locate certain dictionary definitions of "tileboard." See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2393 (1986) ("1: a board used in interior finishing and made from a large sheet of any of various materials having a decorative coating simulating a tiled surface. 2: a thin large square piece (as of wood) often with beveled edges that is fitted together with other like pieces to cover ceilings or walls."); McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms 2151 (6th ed.2003) ("[a] type of wallboard used for interior finishing in which the outer surface is a layer of hard glossy material, usually simulating tile."); Terms of the Trade 342 (4th ed.2000) ("[a] hardboard panel that has been embossed with a pattern and then coated with epoxy. The resulting product is designed to look like ceramic tile, for use in kitchens, bathrooms, etc."); Dictionary of Architecture and Construction 939 (3rd ed.2000)("1. A wallboard used for interior finishing; usually a base sheet material overlaid with a hard, glossy decorative facing to simulate tile. 2. Square or rectangular boards, usually made of compressed wood or vegetable fibers, often with beveled interlocking edges, used for ceiling or wall covering."); (Reed Construction Data at http://www.rsmeans.com/dictionary/index.asp? s=tileboard) ("(1) A wallboard with a factory-applied facing which is hard, glossy, and decorated to simulate tile. (2) A square or rectangular board of compressed wood or vegetable fibers, used for ceiling or wall facings.") (access is free upon registration, which is also free).
[23]  No evidence has been submitted of this nature. Testimony by persons who buy at wholesale, such as buyers for large home improvement stores, would likely produce greatly illuminating evidence of commercial meaning.
[24]  Witex submits a letter from C. Curtis Peterson ("Peterson"), the Executive Vice President of the American Hardboard Association ("AHA"), defining "tileboard" in such a way as to embrace Witex's product. Letter from C. Curtis Peterson to Witex USA, Inc, Ex. 10 to Pl.'s Mem. at 4-5 (Sept. 3 1997) ("Peterson Letter"). However, the Government has argued that this letter is susceptible to two meanings, see Def.'s Mem. at 16, and it appears that Witex never sent a sample of its merchandise for evaluation in garnering this opinion. Witex also cites a letter from the EPLF. See, e.g., Pl.'s Mem. at 5. First, for the reasons stated above, the EPLF does not represent United States commercial practice. See Russell Stadelman & Co. v. United States, 242 F.3d 1044, 1049 (Fed.Cir.2001). Second, the EPLF's letter works against Witex rather than for it. The letter states: "`Tileboard' is considered in the industry to be backing for ceramic tiles." EPLF Letter, Ex. 12 to Pl.'s Mem. Note, the letter does not say "the simulation of ceramic tiles", rather it says "backing" for ceramic tiles. There is no indication from either party that Witex's merchandise is used in conjunction with ceramic tiles; even if simulating ceramic tiles were sufficient, "tileboard" would most likely not cover the simulation of wood.

The Government's evidence fairs no better. The Court notes the most relevant of the Government's submissions. (1) The Government alleges that "the Lowes Home Improvement Center in Brooklyn, New York, displays products labeled as `tileboard,' such as [a physical sample the Government provided the Court], in its `decorative wall paneling' section while laminated flooring is located in the `flooring' section." Def.'s Mem. at 22; Def.'s Reply at 9 n. 23. This is not corroborated by affidavit, deposition or other evidentiary material. See USCIT R. 56(e). (2) The Government submits pictures of Louisiana Pacific Graystone Tileboard, i.e., Louisiana Pacific Graystone Tileboard, Ex. B. to Def.'s Mem., without reference to who took them or where the pictures are from, e.g., a webpage URL or product brochure; these pictures cannot be considered as evidence. (3) The Government cites the Study Concerning the Tariff Classification of Imported Laminate Flooring Panels, a report prepared by F. Holbrook Platts ("Platts") of Platts Laminate Technologies which should have been appended to that brief. Def.'s Mem. at 21. However, the Government has not provided the Court with a copy of that report, the credentials of Platts, or indicated upon what Platts bases his conclusion. (4) Of, and to the extent, the Government is attempting to incorporate Voluntary Product Standard 59-73 on "Prefinished Hardboard Paneling," see Def.'s Mem. at 16-17, the Court notes that this Product Standard was withdrawn in 1980. See Status Report on Withdrawal of Voluntary Product Standards, 45 Fed.Reg. 55,250, 55,250-51 (Nat'l Bureau of Standards Aug. 19, 1980), American National Standards Institute, Prefinished Hardboard Paneling (1973) (with the word "withdrawn" stamped on its cover) (on file with the Court). Moreover, the product standard merely defines products by their finish thereby supporting the Peterson letter (not, necessarily, the Government's position). See American National Standards Institute, Prefinished Hardboard Paneling (1973).(5) The Government's citations to tileboard manufacturers' web sites are not evidence of testimony by wholesalers. See e.g., Def.'s Mem. at 17-18, 22.(6) The Government refers to the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for the Surface Coating Operations of Wood Building Products prepared by the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"). Def.'s Mem. at 22. If the Government submitted evidence that these regulations were promulgated on the basis of industry standards this evidence might be probative; however, the Government has failed to do so, rendering this evidence of low probative value. Cf. RSMC Inc. v. United States, 84 Cust.Ct. 96, 100 (1980). Moreover, without more information, the Court cannot ascertain whether the surface coating criteria used by the EPA is supportive of, or contradictory to, the American Hardboard Association's definition of surface coating discussed infra at notes 25 and 26.(7) The Government notes that Witex has never marketed its product as "tileboard." See, e.g., Def.'s Resp. Ct.'s Questions Prior Oral Arguments Parties' Cross-Motions Summ. J. at 5. Although evidence of marketing practice may be suggestive, it is not dispositive. See Rainin Instrument Co. v. United States, 27 CIT ___, ___, 288 F.Supp.2d 1360, 1366 (2003); cf. Carl Zeiss, Inc. v. United States, 195 F.3d 1375, 1380 (Fed.Cir.1999). Moreover, this does not provide the reason for exclusion, i.e., to which part of the Government's proposed five prong test this evidence lends credence.
[25]  Custom's initial Headquarters Ruling interpreting subheading 4411.19.30, HTSUS, relied on a commercial designation provided by the AHA. HQ 085913 at 2 (January 8, 1990) (citing the AHA's definition of "tileboard" as: a "hard, durable, and water-resistant coating or finishing applied to fiberboard to give it a ceramic-like or marble-like look."). Likewise, the Ruling in this case supported its conclusion by relying on the opinion of the AHA, albeit with a different definition. HQ 960084 at 4 (noting that tileboard and flooring are separate products). As noted above, Witex has submitted a letter from C. Curtis Peterson ("Peterson"), the Executive Vice President of the AHA, which offers yet another definition of "tileboard." Peterson Letter, Ex. 10 to Pl.'s Mem. at 4 ("Tileboard is a melamine coated high density fiberboard panel product" and "[t]he defining characteristic of tileboard paneling is its `finish'" which Peterson defines by reference to the American National Standard (ANSI/AHA A135.5-1995) for Class I Finishes.). Fourth, the Government references the AHA Publication entitled "Tileboard Wall Paneling" that "explains that tileboard paneling is suitable for installation in any room in the home including kitchen and laundry, and that it has a hard durable surface that is highly resistant to stains and moisture when properly installed and maintained." Def.'s Mem. at 16-17. The Government did not cite an exhibit number, but the Court found what appears to have been that to which the Government is referring as an Exhibit to the Amicus' Brief. See Ex. A to Brief of Amicus Curiae Congoleum Corp. in Supp. of Pl.'s Motion for Summ. J. ("Brief of the Amicus"). Testimony by a representative of the AHA would help the Court determine if these definitions can be reconciled.
[26]  Both the Government, and Customs' Ruling, reference the AHA Publication entitled "Tileboard Wall Paneling" for the proposition that: "tileboard paneling is suitable for installation in any room in the home including kitchen and laundry, and that it has a hard durable surface that is highly resistant to stains and moisture when properly installed and maintained." Def.'s Mem. at 16-17; see also HQ 960084. This publication does include language to this effect, but also notes that "[h]ardboard tileboard paneling is covered by U.S. Department of Commerce Voluntary Product Standard PS 59, `Prefinished Hardboard Paneling,' (ANSI A 135.5-1973) Class 1 Finish," American Hardboard Association, Tileboard Wall Paneling, Ex. A to Amicus' Brief at 4, which Witex's product may satisfy, see Aff. of Danny Thomas, Ex. 10 to Pl.'s Mem. at 3 (asserting that Witex meets the ANSI A 135.5-1995 Standard). The meaning of this passage is far from unequivocal. If a product meets the ANSI A135.5-1973 finish specifications (which is presumably an earlier version of the ANSI A 135.5-1995 specifications cited by Witex), does this make the tileboard suitable for application in bathrooms and kitchens, or are these independent requirements? The Government's argument is a little difficult to understand because on the one hand the AHA requires that "tileboard" pass the ANSI A135.5-1973 Standard, which may include a test for humidity resistance, cf. Peterson Letter, Ex. 10 to Pl.'s Mem. at 4 (citing the ANSI A 135.5-1995 Standard which includes a test for "humidity resistance"), while on the other hand, the Government also alleges that tileboard must have greater properties for water resistance than those required by ANSI A 135.5-1973. This problem is made especially difficult because: (a) the Government uses multiple means of referring to water resistance such as "highly resistant to stains and moisture," Def.'s Mem. at 16, or "complete resistance to moisture," id. at 19; (b) frequently discusses water-resistance in terms of where a product is used, e.g., in bathrooms, Def.'s Mem. at 20; and (c) has nowhere defined the required level of water resistance necessary for a product to be considered "tileboard."
[27]  Note that this definition does not require products to be used on walls, and does not necessarily require the product to be water-resistant and to be non-laminated.
[28]  Evidence of this definition has not been submitted to the Court. However, the Court may take judicial notice of the logic and reasoning of Customs Rulings, cf. United States v. Mead, 533 U.S. 218, 235, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001), especially when the Court is looking to displace a commercial meaning used by Customs with a different common meaning. The Court also notes that, as addressed in Note 25, this definition is only one variant of the possible AHA definitions, and is the only one that requires a particular appearance. Therefore, when giving the Government the benefit of the doubt that appearance matters, there is some tension between the commercial and common meaning.
[29]  Witex is joined by a companion case, Faus Group, ___ F.Supp.2d ___, 2004 WL 2595876 (CIT Nov. 15, 2004). The counsel in that case has rested its resolution on the disposition of this case. Furthermore, these proceedings are joined by Amicus Congoleum Corporation who has secured an order from the Court suspending its case on the Court's Reserve Calendar pending resolution of this case. Therefore, the interest in developing a cogent and correct theory of subheading 4411.19.30, HTSUS, to apply to future cases (which is not a mere possibility) is strong. Given that once a commercial or common meaning is established, that meaning remains controlling, see e.g., Intercontinental Marble Corp. v. United States, 381 F.3d 1169, 1176 (Fed.Cir.2004), it is important that the Court not rush to define "tileboard" with less than complete information as to its meaning.

259 U.S. 209 (1922)
MUTUAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY OF NEW YORK
v.
LIEBING.
No. 215.
Supreme Court of United States.
Argued April 21, 24, 1922.
Decided May 29, 1922.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI.
*210 Mr. Wm. Marshall Bullitt, with whom Mr. Frederick L. Allen, Mr. John H. Holliday, Mr. Frederic D. McKenney, Mr. S.W. Fordyce, Mr. Thomas W. White and Mr. W.H. Woodward were on the briefs, for plaintiff in error.
Mr. James J. O'Donohoe for defendant in error.
*212 MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a suit to recover upon a policy insuring the life of one Blees, issued to him and subsequently assigned by him to his wife, now Mrs. Liebing, the plaintiff (defendant in error). The contract was made on September 29, 1901, by the defendant (the plaintiff in error), in Missouri, by a delivery of the policy to Blees in Macon, Missouri, where he lived. Three annual premiums were paid. After the fourth was due, within the time allowed, Blees and his wife signed an application for a loan of $9,550 and sent it with the policy to the defendant's agency at St. Louis, by which it was forwarded to New York. The application followed the terms of the policy, which agreed that after it had been in force three years the company would lend amounts within the cash surrender value, upon certain conditions, the policy being assigned as security. Following these terms the application deducted from the cash to be received the fourth annual premium and an adjustment of interest, leaving the balance to be paid $4,790.50. The loan was to be for one year and the application authorized the company upon default to cancel the policy and apply the customary cash surrender consideration to the payment of the loan. The application was approved in New York and a check for $4,790.50 to the order of Mr. and Mrs. Blees, with a receipt for the fourth premium, was *213 sent from New York to the company's manager in St. Louis and by him forwarded to a local agent who delivered the documents to Blees. The check was endorsed and paid. A year later when repayment was due it was not made. Thereupon on December 4, 1905, the company canceled the policy and applied the surrender value to the loan, which was of equal amount, leaving a deficit of $74.57 interest. Blees died on September 8, 1906, and upon inquiry from Mrs. Blees the company notified her of what had been done. Its action had been in accordance with the terms of its contract and the law of New York. But some years later, Mrs. Blees, now Mrs. Liebing, brought the present action relying upon the Revised Statutes of Missouri, 1899, § 7897, set forth and considered in New York Life Insurance Co. v. Dodge, 246 U.S. 357, and, after a previous decision the other way, she recovered by the final judgment of the Supreme Court of the State. 226 S.W. 897.
The Missouri statute provided that such policies as the present, after three annual payments, should not become void for nonpayment of premiums, but that three-fourths of the net value of the policy after deducting certain liabilities should be taken as a premium for temporary insurance for the full amount written in the policy. It is not disputed that if this statute governs the case, the plaintiff stood as having a policy for the original amount at the death of Mr. Blees. In New York Life Insurance Co. v. Dodge, 246 U.S. 357, it was held that when the later transaction was consummated in New York, Missouri could not prohibit a citizen within her borders from executing it. But if the later contract was made in Missouri, then by the present and earlier decisions notwithstanding any contrary agreement the statute does govern the case. See 246 U.S. 366.
The policy now sued upon contained a positive promise to make the loan if asked, whereas in the one last mentioned *214 it might be held that some discretion was reserved to the company. For here the language is "the company will . . . loan amounts within the limits of the cash surrender value", &c., whereas there it was "cash loans can be obtained." On this distinction the Missouri court seems to have held that as soon as the application was delivered to a representative of the company in Missouri the offer in the policy was accepted and the new contract complete, and therefore subject to Missouri law. If, however, the application should be regarded as only an offer the effective acceptance of it did not take place until the check was delivered to Blees, which again was in Missouri where he lived. In whichever way regarded the facts lead to the same conclusion, and although the circumstances may present some temptation to seek a different one by ingenuity, the Constitution and the first principles of legal thinking allow the law of the place where a contract is made to determine the validity and the consequences of the act.

Stephen R. Arnold of Durward & Arnold, Birmingham, for appellee.
RUSSELL, Judge.
This case involves post-divorce proceedings and, in particular, the payment of post-minority support for college education.
We note, at the outset, that this is the second time that this case has been before us. In Ex parte Bayliss, 550 So.2d 986, 987 (Ala.1989), the supreme court held that "[i]n Alabama, ... a trial court [has] jurisdiction to require parents to provide postminority support for college education to children of a marriage that has been terminated by divorce." In compliance with the supreme court's opinion, this case was reversed and remanded to the trial court for proceedings consistent with that opinion. 550 So.2d 996. On remand, the trial court *1119 ordered John Martin Bayliss III (father) to pay an amount equivalent to room, board, books, tuition, and necessary fees at Auburn University beginning with the winter term which started in January 1990 (the last three semesters of college) for his son, Patrick Bayliss. Cherry R. Bayliss (mother) appeals. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.
Although the mother raises a number of contentions, we find the dispositive issue to be whether the trial court abused its discretion in requiring that the father pay postminority support for a college education at the cost of an in-state, public school for only the last three semesters of college when Patrick had been attending a private, out-of-state school for two and one-half years.
We further note that, where evidence is presented ore tenus, the trial court's judgment is presumed correct unless it is so unsupported by the evidence that it is plainly and palpably wrong. Coby v. Coby, 489 So.2d 597 (Ala.Civ.App.1986). However, where there is no factual dispute, there is no presumption of correctness which attaches to the court's determination, and, therefore, our inquiry is limited to whether the relevant law was correctly applied to the undisputed facts. Birmingham Retirement & Relief System v. Elliott, 532 So.2d 1019 (Ala.Civ.App.1988). Additionally, matters of child support rest within the trial court's discretion and will be reversed only upon a showing that it has abused its discretion or that its determination is plainly and palpably wrong. Brannon v. Brannon, 477 So.2d 445 (Ala.Civ. App.1985).
The record reveals that Patrick was one of two children born of the marriage and that the mother and the father were divorced in 1982. In January 1988, the mother filed a petition to modify, requesting increased alimony and increased child support for Patrick, then age 18. In March 1988, when Patrick had attained the age of 19, the mother amended her petition, seeking payment for Patrick's college education from the father. Patrick began attending Trinity College in the fall of 1987.
Testimony from the first hearing, which was held on May 23, 1988, reveals that the mother receives $36,000 per year in alimony, and that in 1987, she received an additional $4,000 in income from investments and earned approximately $2,000 from a business selling clothes out of her home. The mother also sold a portion of the land that she received with the marital home for $20,000 and increased the mortgage on the marital home by $50,000. The sums from the sale of the land and remortgage of the home were invested and have been used to send Patrick to Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut. The testimony further reveals that the father's total income was $372,245 for 1986, $320,731 for 1987, and $411,968 for 1988, and that a portion of the stated income includes undistributed partnership profits. The father has refused Patrick's requests for financial help, has refused to co-sign for a loan in Patrick's name, and has not directly contributed to the cost of Patrick's college education.
Patrick testified that he discussed Trinity College and Washington and Lee University with his father after visiting twentythree schools and before applying to Trinity College, but that he did not discuss college choices with his father after his father refused financial support for college. The father testified that he did not object to Trinity College, that Patrick never discussed entering Trinity College with him, and that he had stated that he might help Patrick with college, but only after the mother had exhausted her funds.
At the hearing on remand, which was held on January 12, 1990, it was stipulated that Patrick was in the middle of his junior year at Trinity College; that the cost per year for tuition, room, board, fees, and student activity was $17,000 and the cost for indirect expenses was $5,500, for a total cost of $22,500 a year; that the mother has paid for all but $2,500 per year, which Patrick receives from a student loan; that Patrick does well at Trinity College and that his grades were A's and B's; and that the father has "the financial ability to respond to Patrick's needs."
*1120 The record indicates that there was no factual dispute between the parties; therefore, we must now determine whether the trial court correctly applied the relevant law to the facts and whether the judgment was an abuse of discretion and plainly and palpably wrong. Birmingham Retirement & Relief System, 532 So.2d 1019; Brannon, 477 So.2d 445.
Since the amount of post-minority college support that a non-custodial parent can be required to provide is a question of first impression, we look to Bayliss, wherein the supreme court merged the law of other states, for guidance.
In Bayliss, the supreme court addressed the jurisdiction of the trial court to require parents to provide post-minority support for college education to children of a marriage terminated by divorce as follows:
"In a proceeding for dissolution of marriage or a modification of a divorce judgment, a trial court may award sums of money out of the property and income of either or both parents for the post-minority education of a child of that dissolved marriage, when application is made therefor, as in the case at issue, before the child attains the age of majority. In doing so, the trial court shall consider all relevant factors that shall appear reasonable and necessary, including primarily the financial resources of the parents and the child and the child's commitment to, and aptitude for, the requested education. The trial court may consider, also, the standard of living that the child would have enjoyed if the marriage had not been dissolved and the family unit had been preserved and the child's relationship with his parents and responsiveness to parental advice and guidance."
550 So.2d at 987 (first emphasis supplied; second emphasis original in Bayliss).
The supreme court additionally stated:
"Our trial courts have demonstrated that they have the wisdom of Solomon in these domestic matters. We know that they will continue to demonstrate that wisdom in deciding whether to require a parent to provide, or help defray the cost of, a college education for a child, even after that child attains the age of 19 years."
Id. at 995.
Clearly, the trial court has been given discretionary authority to determine whether to award any post-minority college support applied for during minority for the child's education and in making this determination "shall consider all relevant factors that shall appear reasonable and necessary." Id. at 987.
Bayliss clearly specifies those factors which shall, and those which may, be considered by the trial court in awarding sums for post-minority education, and we must now determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in applying these factors in its determination that the husband be responsible for a portion of the cost of the remainder of Patrick's four-year college education (three semesters) at the cost of Auburn University.
We will first address the financial resources of the parents, one factor which must be considered by the trial court in awarding sums for college education. Although the father's income was over $400,000 in 1988, he testified that a portion of his income either was in-kind or was partnership profits which were not received. The wife receives $36,000 in alimony from the husband, plus whatever she receives in income from selling clothes and from investment income. In considering the comparative financial resources of the mother and father, the trial judge may very well have considered the evidence that the income shown in the husband's tax returns did not indicate the amount of income that he actually received and that the husband was already paying $36,000 in alimony to the wife.
The next factor listed in Bayliss, which must be considered by the trial court, is the child's commitment to, and aptitude for, the requested education. The supreme court stated that Patrick would be "an Alpha Plus if this were Huxley's Brave New World," Bayliss, 550 So.2d at 994, and we find that this continues to be true. Patrick has maintained his grades at a very high *1121 level, as well as participating in athletics and other activities, thereby demonstrating his aptitude for college education. Therefore, we find that Patrick has clearly demonstrated the commitment to, and the aptitude for, a college education.
An additional factor which the trial court may consider in awarding sums of money for a college education is the standard of living which the child would have enjoyed if the family had not been separated by divorce.
Here, there was evidence presented to the trial court that the father attended Auburn University and that he had recommended attendance at a state school to Patrick if Patrick planned to live in Alabama. In considering the standard of living that the child would have enjoyed if the marriage had not been dissolved, we find that the trial court could have considered that Patrick may very well have been provided a college education at Auburn University and no more.
Finally, the supreme court in Bayliss has directed that the trial court may consider the child's relationship with his parents and his responsiveness to their advice and guidance.
The father cites cases from other jurisdictions for the proposition that the distance between Patrick and the father is a factor which supports the trial court's decision. We note that in those cases the parent was excused from paying any amount toward the cost of a college education due to complete repudiation of the parent by the child and refusal to associate with the parent for no apparent reason. See Hambrick v. Prestwood, 382 So.2d 474 (Miss. 1980), and Riegler v. Riegler, 259 Ark. 203, 532 S.W.2d 734 (1976).
In the present case, Patrick did discuss his college visitation with his father, but did not initiate further discussions regarding college choices with his father after the father declined to give financial aid. Although the son and the father may both be at fault in their estrangement, the trial court could have considered the exclusion of the father from the college selection process and the lack of input as to cost management in its decision limiting the father's financial responsibility to a portion of the cost of a college education at Auburn University.
We also note that, in limiting the father's cost to the payment of tuition, room, board, books, and fees, the trial court could have left the other reasonable expenses of maintenance to be supplied by the mother or other sources. We find that this is also in line with the holding in Bayliss, wherein the supreme court states that "a trial court may award sums of money out of the property and income of either or both parents." Bayliss, 550 So.2d at 987.
Finally, we will consider that portion of the trial court's judgment which holds that the father shall contribute to Patrick's college education beginning with the winter term which started in January 1990. This coincides with the issuance of the trial court's order on remand. The petition to modify was filed on January 6, 1988, in the middle of Patrick's freshman year at Trinity College; the trial court's first order was entered on June 21, 1988; and Ex parte Bayliss was rendered in the summer of 1989. The trial court did not apply any of these dates for retroactive application of the college support obligation of the father. In the absence of such retroactive application, the father would only be required to assist with three semesters of Patrick's attendance at college. Our interpretation of Bayliss is that this was not the intent of the supreme court.
It is apparent that time is particularly crucial in a request for modification to provide for post-minority support for a college education. In the present case, although the mother filed her petition to modify at the end of Patrick's first semester in college, support has been granted only from the middle of his junior year. Without retroactivity in a case such as this, it is possible that a case could be delayed by appeals until college attendance was completed and that the non-custodial parent could avoid his or her duty to provide that support. "There is a sound policy favoring retroactivity in most cases, because the party entitled to support should not be penalized for having to resort to time-consuming *1122 court proceedings." Sutliff v. Sutliff, 339 Pa.Super. 523, 556, 489 A.2d 764, 781 (1985). Therefore, we find that, in cases involving post-minority support for college education where the child is already attending college, the decision rendered by the trial court will be retroactive to the time of the filing of the request.
Based on the above, we find that the trial court correctly applied the relevant law to the facts, that the judgment of the trial court was supported by the evidence, and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it ordered the father to pay an amount equivalent to room, board, books, tuition, and necessary fees at Auburn University. However, we further find that the part of the order that grants this support from the beginning of the winter term which started in January of 1990 is due to be reversed and that the support is to be granted from the date of the filing of the petition to modify.
This case is due to be affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded with instructions to enter an order consistent with this opinion.

                     Affirmed and Remanded - Filed July 27, 2016


In these consolidated interlocutory appeals, an employer and the Second Injury Fund
present procedural issues questioning the trial court's denial of motions to dismiss the
employee's claims and motions to alter or amend status conference orders. Additionally,
the Second Injury Fund questions the trial court's authority to set a scheduling hearing
sua sponte. Following a show cause hearing, which was set when no party requested a
hearing within sixty days after the filing of dispute certification notices, the trial court
held a status conference that resulted in the employee's being allowed more time to file a
request for an expedited hearing. The trial court's orders instructed the parties to
participate in a second status conference if the employee did not file a request for an
expedited hearing by a specified date. Following a hearing on motions for dismissal and
other motions by the employers and the Second Injury Fund, the trial court denied the
motions and set a scheduling hearing. One employer and the Second Injury Fund have
appealed. We affirm the trial court' s denial of the various motions and remand the case
for further proceedings as may be necessary.

                                 Factual and Procedural Background

        On May 27, 2015, Lazaro Valladares ("Employee") filed two petitions for benefit
determination with the Bureau of Workers' Compensation ("Bureau"). In the first
petition, he alleged he slipped on gravel and fell on October 2, 2014, resulting in work-
related injuries to his left arm, low back, and body while in the employment of Specialty
Services, LLC ("Specialty Services"). In the second petition, he alleged he slipped and
fell in the rain on November 5, 2014, while in the employment of Transco Products, Inc.
(" ransco Products"), which caused work-related injuries to his right leg, left shoulder,
                                                                               2
and body. 1 Both petitions included the Second Injury Fund ("SIF") as a party.

       Employee alleged he reported both injuries to his employers. He apparently
neither sought nor received medical care following the October 2, 2014 incident. After
reporting the second incident, he was provided a panel of physicians by Transco
Products. 3 He was seen twice by Dr. Rickey Hutcheson, the physician he selected from
the panel, but he declined to return to Dr. Hutcheson after the second visit and requested
that he be provided a different physician. Since that time, Employee has received
medical care from a physician he selected on his own who was not authorized by
Specialty Services or Transco Products. Except for Employee's indication that he has
had surgery on his cervical spine, there is no information in the record regarding the
nature or extent of Employee's medical treatment.

1
 No testimony has been given in this case and no affidavits or declarations made under penalty of perjury
have been filed with the trial court. Accordingly, the limited facts presented herein are taken from the
documents filed with the Bureau that are included in the technical record on appeal.
2
    The two claims were consolidated by the trial court.
3
  In numerous places throughout the record, reference is made to Employee's not having been provided a
panel of physicians. However, it appears to be undisputed that he was given a panel as a result of his
second alleged injury and that he chose a physician from that panel.
                                                       2
        Following the filing of the petitions and unsuccessful efforts to resolve the claims
through the Bureau's mediation process, dispute certification notices were filed on July
20, 2015. Because no party filed a request for hearing in either claim within 60 days of
the filing of the dispute certification notices, on November 24, 2015, the claims were
placed on a dismissal calendar for a show cause hearing, which was scheduled for
December 21, 2015. 4

        At Employee's request, the parties agreed to continue the show cause hearing to
January 12, 2016. Following the hearing, the trial court issued show cause orders that
extended the time for Employee to decide how to proceed until January 29, 2016 and
scheduled a status conference for that date. These orders required Employee's attorney to
inform the court during the January 29, 2016 status conference how Employee intended
to proceed and addressed the dates by which requests for an expedited hearing or an
initial hearing were to be made:

        If [Employee's attorney] informs the Court at the Status Conference that his
        client intends to file a Request for Expedited Hearing, the Court will enter
        an order requiring that he file the Request for Expedited Hearing within
        five business days from January 29, 2016, or, failing such, his claim will be
        dismissed without prejudice. If [Employee's attorney] informs the Court at
        the Status Conference that his client requests an Initial (Scheduling)
        Hearing, the Court will schedule [the claims] for a Compensation Hearing.

        Following the January 29, 2016 status conference, orders were entered noting
Employee's request for additional time to obtain an expert medical opinion and the SIF's
objection to the request and its own requests that the court schedule a compensation
hearing. The trial court granted Employee until February 29, 2016 to file requests for
expedited hearings, stating in its February 5, 2016 orders that "[i]f [Employee] has not
filed a Request for Expedited Hearing on or before February 29, 2016, the parties shall
call . . . on March 10, 2016, to schedule a Compensation Hearing and the attendant
deadlines." In addition, the orders provided that, should Employee file requests for
expedited hearings on or before February 29, 2016, "the Court will not conduct the
scheduling conference on March 10, 2016." The orders allowed the parties "to engage in
discovery at this time .... " The February 5, 2016 orders were not appealed.

        Employee did not file a request for a hearing, and on March 4, 2016, the court
clerk issued docketing notices setting an initial hearing on March 10, 2016. However,
prior to the March 10 hearing, but more than 30 days after entry of the February 5, 2016
4
 See Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 0800-02-21-.12( 1) (2015) ("Immediately after a dispute certification notice
has been filed with the clerk, either party seeking further resolution of any disputed issues shall file a
request for a hearing .... If no request for hearing is filed within sixty (60) calendar days after the date
of issuance of the dispute certification notice, the clerk shall docket the case and place the case on a
separate dismissal calendar for a show cause hearing.")

                                                     3
status conference order, the SIF filed a motion to alter or amend the February 5, 2016
status conference order and for entry of a dismissal order. The SIF contended in its
motion that the trial court had no authority to set an initial hearing, arguing that "since no
request for hearing has been filed, it is the position of the SIF that this matter can only be
set sua sponte by this Court for a Show Cause hearing." The SIF requested the trial court
to "alter or amend its Status Conference Orders insofar as those Orders [and the
subsequent Docketing Notices] set this matter for an initial/scheduling conference on
March 10, 2016, and instead set this matter for a final show cause hearing on that date for
entry of an Order of Dismissal in accordance with this Court's Order of January 13, 2016
.... " (Brackets in original.) On March 8, 2016, the SIF filed a "Motion to Set Final
Show Cause Hearing on March 10, 2016, or, in the Alternative, to Continue Initial
Hearing." On the same date, the SIF filed a "Supplemental Motion to Alter or Amend
Status Conference Orders and to Set for Final Show Cause Hearing." The SIF again
asserted in its motions that "since no request for hearing has been filed, it is the position
of the SIF that this matter can only be set sua sponte by this Court for a Show Cause
hearing." The SIF requested that, rather than conduct an initial/scheduling conference on
March 10, 2016, the court "instead set this matter for a final show cause hearing on that
date."

       At the March l 0, 2016 hearing, the parties announced they were in agreement to
continue the initial/scheduling hearing. Based on the parties' discussions with the court,
the court continued "the Initial (Scheduling) Hearing" to March 29, 2016 and allowed
"[a]ny party wishing to file written opposition to the [SIF's] motions [to] do so no later
than March 22, 2016." The trial court's March 11, 2016 order stated that Employee's
counsel "shall further report on his client's medical progress during the ... hearing."
Additionally, the court's order stated that the court "informed counsel that, at the motion
hearing, they should announce their clients' positions as to whether a bifurcated hearing
on the disputed legal/causation issues in these claims is in order to move this claim
forward more expeditiously."

       Thereafter, Transco Products filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12 of the
Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure, asserting that the dispute certification notice filed in
the claim against it limited the issues to "whether Employee is entitled to a second
opinion following the selection of his authorized treating physician." Contending
Employee was not entitled to a second opinion, Trancso Products asserted that Employee
could not prevail against it without such opinion and that the claim against it should,
therefore, be dismissed. Specialty Services likewise filed a motion to dismiss asserting
"the mere fact that Employee fell at work is not sufficient to maintain an action against
(Specialty Services] when there is no evidence of any resulting injury." In addition,
Specialty Services adopted the SIF's motion to dismiss. Alternatively, Specialty Services
moved the court for a more definite statement of the claims asserted against it.



                                              4
       Employee filed a response to the SIF's motions, requesting that the trial court
"schedule these matters for a Compensation Hearing." Because both employers filed
potentially dispositive motions, to which the Practices and Procedures of the Court of
Workers' Compensation Claims allows an employee thirty days to respond, the trial court
issued a docketing notice on April 11, 2016 scheduling an in-person hearing to address
all pending motions on May 18, 2016. On the scheduled hearing date, Employee filed a
response to Transco Products' motion to dismiss, requesting again that the trial court
"schedule this matter for a Compensation Hearing."

        Following the May 18, 2016 hearing, the trial court entered an order denying the
SIF's motion to alter or amend the status conference orders. The trial court determined
that "it is not required to await a party's request for an Initial (Scheduling) Hearing, but
may schedule an Initial (Scheduling) Hearing sua sponte if it deems such is necessary to
move a case toward an efficient and timely conclusion." Additionally, the trial court
determined the SIF's argument for dismissal of Employee's claim was based on "an
incorrect interpretation of the Court's January 13, 2016 order," and was without merit.
Finally, the trial court set an initial hearing for June 15, 2016 "at which time it will
schedule the Compensation [Hearing] and attendant deadlines in these claims."

        Similarly, the trial court denied Transco Products' motion to dismiss, determining
that although "the Court considered Transco's motion unopposed," the lack of opposition
to a motion does not require the court to "automatically grant the relief moved for."
Determining that Transco Products' Rule 12 motion was "based on the allegation that
[Employee's] [petition for benefit determination] ... failed to state a claim recognized by
law," the trial court concluded that Employee provided "a short and plain statement
communicating that he sought workers' compensation benefits for the described work-
related injury." The trial court also determined that the dispute certification notice did
not limit his request for relief to a second medical opinion, but sought "a new treating
physician and, potentially, other remedies for Transco's failure to provide him a panel of
physicians." The trial court considered "it appropriate to review the [dispute certification
notice] in considering whether [Employee] has sufficiently stated a claim," and
concluded that "[c]learly, [Employee] seeks remedies other than a second opinion."

        The trial court also denied Specialty Services' motion to dismiss and its motion to
alter or amend the status conference orders. However, in light of Employee's counsel's
agreement during the May 18 hearing, the trial court granted Specialty Services' motion
for a more definite statement, ordering that Employee "file ... a more definite statement
regarding the alleged injury he sustained in the course and scope of his employment [with
Specialty Services]."

       On June 7, 2016, the SIF filed a motion to stay the proceedings pending an appeal,
asserting that "[i]n the event the Appeals Board modifies or reverses [the trial court's]
interlocutory order, it would be in the interest of judicial economy and efficiency to stay

                                             5
the Initial Hearing and further proceedings in this Court until prompt resolution of the
appeal." The trial court granted the motion and stayed "all further proceedings in these
claims pending the completion of the [SIF's] appeal" and cancelled "the Initial
(Scheduling) Hearing scheduled for June 15, 2016." Both the SIF and Transco Products
have appealed.

                                  Standard of Review

       The standard we apply in reviewing a trial court's decision is statutorily mandated
and limited in scope. Specifically, "[t]here shall be a presumption that the findings and
conclusions of the workers' compensation judge are correct, unless the preponderance of
the evidence is otherwise." Tenn. Code Ann. § 50-6-239(c)(7) (2015). The trial court's
decision must be upheld unless the rights of a party "have been prejudiced because
findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions of a workers' compensation judge:

       (A)    Violate constitutional or statutory provisions;
       (B)    Exceed the statutory authority of the workers' compensation judge;
       (C)    Do not comply with lawful procedure;
       (D)    Are arbitrary, capricious, characterized by abuse of discretion, or
              clearly an unwarranted exercise of discretion; or
       (E)    Are not supported by evidence that is both substantial and material
              in the light of the entire record."

Tenn. Code Ann. § 50-6-217(a)(3) (2015). Like other courts applying the standards
embodied in section 50-6-217(a)(3), we will not disturb the decision of the trial court
absent the limited circumstances identified in the statute.

                                        Analysis

                                Transco Products 'Appeal

        In its brief on appeal, Transco Products raises two issues, which we have restated
as whether the trial court erred in allowing Employee to present oral argument at the May
18, 2016 hearing in opposition to Transco Products' motion to dismiss, and whether the
trial court erred in determining that Employee sufficiently stated a claim for relief. We
find no merit in either issue.

               Whether Trial Court Erred in AlJowing Oral Argument Opposing
                            Transco Products' Motion to Dismiss

       Rule 4.0l(B) of the Practices and Procedures of the Court of Workers'
Compensation Claims provides the following guidance with respect to the time within
which a party must respond to a dispositive motion:

                                            6
        If a dispositive motion is opposed, a response to the motion must be filed
        and served . . . on or before thirty calendar days after the filing of the
        dispositive motion. The response shall be in writing and shall state with
        particularity the grounds for the opposition. If no opposition is, filed, the
        dispositive motion will be considered unopposed.

Employee filed a response to Transco Products' March 18, 2016 motion to dismiss the
morning of the May 18, 2016 hearing, which was significantly more than 30 days after
the filing of the dispositive motion. Transco Products objected to the late filing, and the
trial court refused to consider the written filing, stating it was "going to consider the
motion to be unopposed" in accordance with Rule 4.0l(B). Nonetheless, the trial court
allowed Employee's counsel to argue his position at the hearing and granted Transco
Products' request for time to respond in writing to the Employee's oral argument.
However, in its June 2, 2016 order denying the motion to dismiss, the court noted that it
"does not consider the term 'unopposed' as used in Rule 4.0l(B) as a requirement that it
automatically grant the relief moved for. The moving party must still show entitlement
under the law to the relief moved for." The trial court did not address Employee's oral
argument in its order denying the motion to dismiss, but determined that the motion to
dismiss was based on Employee's alleged failure to state a claim for relief under Rule
12.02(6) of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure.

       Transco Products asserts on appeal that "if any rational[] basis exists to grant an
unopposed motion, the Trial Court is bound to grant said motion." Transco Products has
cited no authority in support of this argument. Neither Rule 4.0l(B) nor any other
applicable rule prohibits a trial court from deciding motions on their merits. Likewise,
the Bureau's regulations do not prohibit a trial court from considering the merits of an
unopposed motion. Cf Rochelle v. Oscar Mayer Foods Corp., No. 01-S-01-9207-CH-
00087, 1992 Tenn. LEXIS 748, at *12 (Tenn. Workers' Comp. Panel Jan. 19, 1993)
(Local rules of practice requiring a response to an opposed motion to be filed and
providing that the court may dispose of the motion as unopposed if no response is filed
"do[] not prohibit any court from deciding questions on their merits."). Accordingly,
under the circumstances presented, we discern no error in the trial court's allowing
Employee to orally express his opposition to Transco Products' motion to dismiss at the
hearing. We also find no error in the trial court's decision to consider the merits of the
motion despite the lack of a written response.

                     Whether mp loyee Sufficiently Stated a Claim for Relief

       The second issue Transco Products raises on appeal is whether Employee stated an
actionable claim against it. In its brief on appeal, it asserts that "[t]o test the sufficiency
of Employee's pleading, [it] filed a Motion to Dismiss to determine whether Employee
has set forth a valid claim for which relief can be granted." Noting the trial court's
reliance on Trau-Med of Am., Inc. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 71 S.W.3d 691, 696 (Tenn. 2002),

                                              7
    and asserting that the trial court "essentially equates Employee's [petition for benefit
    determination] to the filing of a complaint," Transco Products contends "the sparse facts
    contained within the [petition for benefit determination], without more, do not survive a
    Motion to Dismiss."

            In analyzing this issue, the trial court noted that Employee filed his claim against
    Transco Products by completing a petition for benefit determination. The trial court
    observed that "[w]hen read as a whole, [Employee's] petition for benefit determination
    against Transco states that he injured his 'right leg, left shoulder and body' when he
    'slipped and fell in rain while carrying [an] MRI panel' on '11/05/2014."' The court
    concluded that "the petition for benefit determination filed by [Employee] provided
    Transco a short and plain statement communicating that he sought workers'
    compensation benefits for the described work-related injury. Accordingly, Transco is not
    entitled to dismissal under Rule 12.02(6)." We agree.

        In order to commence a cause of action within the applicable limitations period, an
injured worker must timely file a petition for benefit determination. Tenn. Code Ann. §
50-6-203(b ). A petition for benefit determination is defined as "a request for the
 [Bureau] to provide assistance in the resolution of any disputed issues in a workers'
compensation claim." Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 0800-02-21-.02(19) (2015). We have
noted that a petition for benefit determination is the general equivalent of a complaint
because it initiates the process for resolving disputes whether or not benefits have been
paid. See Duck v. Cox Oil Co., No. 2015-07-0089, 2016 TN Wrk. Comp. App. Bd.
LEXIS 2 (Tenn. Workers' Comp. App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2016); see also Black's Law
Dictionary (6th ed. 1990) (defining a "complaint" as "the original or initial pleading by
which an action is commenced" and a "petition" as "a formal written application to a
court requesting judicial action on a certain matter."). 5 This means that, when faced with
the type of motion to dismiss as was filed in this case, the trial court will consider
whether, assuming the truth of the employee's averments, the employee can prove no set
of facts entitling him or her to relief. 6

5
   In his concurrence, our colleague argues that the filing of a petition for benefit determination and a
dispute certification notice "occurs before the point in time at which the Tennessee Rules of Civil
Procedure have attached to the process." While we agree with this statement in the abstract, we find
nothing in the statute or regulations that prohibits a trial court from examining these filings once the Rules
of Civil Procedure are applicable, as they are here, to determine their sufficiency in the context of a
pending motion. Moreover, our colleague asserts that "the analysis fails to address the procedure
established in the Reform Act for presenting disputed issues to the trial court." We disagree. Nothing in
the statute or regulations prohibits a party from utilizing Tenn. R. Civ. P. 15.01 or Tennessee Code
Annotated section 50-6-239(b), as applicable, to amend such filings by use of a motion, as opposed to
filing a request for expedited hearing. Indeed, the trial court in this case granted an employer's motion for
more definite statement, thereby giving the employee an opportunity to amend the allegations in his
petition for benefit determination.
6
    Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 12.02(6) governs motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon

                                                      8
       As noted above, Employee's petition for benefit determination naming Transco
Products as a party alleged an injury to his "right leg, left shoulder and body" when he
"slipped and fell in rain while carrying [an] MRI panel" on "11/05/2014." He
characterized the disputed issue as the "right to medical treatment under Tenn. Code Ann.
50-6-204." He indicated that he had not been provided a panel of physicians, identified
the doctor he had seen for the injury, and described the medical care provided to include
"x-ray of right leg, MRI." In addition, he indicated that the SIF was involved. The trial
court determined Employee's petition sufficiently stated a cause of action and declined to
dismiss the case. Taking the assertions in the petition as true for purposes of Rule
12.02(6) as we must, see Bell, 986 S.W.2d at 554, we find no error in the trial court's
denial of Transco Products' motion to dismiss.

                                  The Second Injury Fund's Appeal

        The SIF presents two issues on appeal. First, it alleges the trial court erred in
setting the cases for an initial hearing when the parties did not request a hearing. Second,
it alleges the trial court erred "in failing to dismiss [Employee's] claims in accordance
with [the trial court's] prior order(s)."

         Following the trial court's issuance of the June 2, 2016 order denying the SIF's
motions, the SIF filed a motion to stay the proceedings pending its appeal, representing
that it would timely appeal the trial court's June 2, 2016 order. The motion to stay the
proceedings noted that the trial court's June 2, 2016 order scheduled an initial hearing on
June 15, 2016, and asserted that "[i]n the event the Appeals Board modifies or reverses
this Court's interlocutory order, it would be in the interest of judicial economy and
efficiency to stay the Initial Hearing and further proceedings in this Court until prompt
resolution of the appeal." On June 8, 2016, the trial court stayed the proceedings, finding
"that a stay of these proceedings serves the interest of judicial economy." The June 8,
2016 order cancelled the June 15, 2016 initial hearing and arguably rendered the SIF's
first issue on appeal moot. We note, however, that although Rule 0800-02-21-.12 does
not explicitly authorize trial courts to schedule initial hearings where no party has
requested a hearing, nothing in the regulations precludes a trial court from doing so.
Specifically, Rule 0800-02-21-.13(1) requires parties to participate in an initial hearing
"no more than thirty (30) calendar days after a request for hearing is filed," but the rule
does not preclude the possibility that such a hearing could be scheduled by the court
earlier. Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 0800-02-21-.13(1) (2015) (emphasis added). It is

which relief can be granted. Such a motion challenges only the legal sufficiency of the complaint or
request for relief, not the strength of the proof. See Bell ex rel. Snyder v. Icard, Merrill, Cul/is, Timm,
Furen & Ginsburg, P.A., 986 S.W.2d 550, 554 (Tenn. 1999) ("Such a motion admits the truth of all
relevant and material averments contained in the complaint, but asserts that such facts do not constitute a
cause of action as a matter of law."). Thus, a trial court should grant a Rule 12.02(6) motion to dismiss
only when it appears the employee can prove no set of facts in support of the claim that would warrant
relief. Doe v. Sunquist, 2 S.W.3d 919, 922 (Tenn. 1999).

                                                    9
consistent with common practice, applicable regulations, the Tennessee Rules of Civil
Procedure, and the need to control its docket and the progress of cases to allow a trial
court to set a scheduling hearing in the absence of a request by a party to do so.

        The SIF's second issue questions the trial court's failure to dismiss Employee's
claims pursuant to the trial court's January 13, 2016 order. In its brief, the SIF states
"[t]he position of the SIF is that [Employee's] claim should have been dismissed for
failure to show cause after being given a multitude of opportunities to do so." We note
that a show cause hearing was held on January 12, 2016, and that the trial court issued a
show cause order the following day granting Employee "time to decide how to proceed ..
. until January 29, 2016, on which date the Court scheduled a telephonic Status
Conference." No one appealed the January 13, 2016 show cause order or the February 5,
2016 status conference orders. Rather, the SIF filed motions to alter or amend the status
conference orders on March 7, 2016, which the trial court denied in the order on appeal.
Focusing on the trial court's explanation in the June 2, 2016 order on appeal addressing
why the January 13, 2016 show cause order did not mandate dismissal of Employee's
claims, the SIF contends that "based on the totality of the circumstances, it is clear that
[Employee's attorney] in fact communicated to the Court on January 29, 2016, that he
was filing a Request for Expedited Hearing, not a Request for Initial Hearing." Asserting
that "[s]ince [Employee's attorney] was ordered to inform the Court which of the two
hearings he intended to pursue and the Court did not schedule a compensation hearing at
that time, an inference should be drawn that [the attorney] communicated to the Court he
was pursuing an expedited hearing."

        As noted in the SIF's brief, "no audio recordings of either January hearing were
preserved." Beyond what the transcripts of the March 10, 2016 and May 18, 2016
hearings and the trial court's orders reveal, we cannot know what the "totality of the
circumstances" might be, nor can we draw inferences concerning what a party or counsel
communicated or represented to the court without the aid of transcripts of the
proceedings or orders identifying such communications. It is the responsibility of the
appealing party to ensure a complete record on appeal by either filing a transcript
prepared by a licensed court reporter or, alternatively, filing a statement of the evidence.
See Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 0800-02-22-.02(2). Here, transcripts of the March 10, 2016
and May 18, 2016 hearings were filed with the trial court, but neither transcripts of the
January 12, 2016 and January 29, 2016 hearings nor a statement of the evidence
presented in those hearings was included in the record. We are unable to discern the
"totality of the circumstances" as suggested by the SIF without such transcripts.

       Moreover, the January 13, 2016 order upon which the SIF relies included the
following language that the SIF contends bound the trial court to a specific course of
action that it failed to take:



                                             10
       If [Employee's attorney] informs the Court at the [January 29, 2016] Status
       Conference that his client intends to file a Request for Expedited Hearing,
       the Court will enter an order requiring that he file the Request for
       Expedited Hearing within five business days from January 29, 2016, or,
       failing such, his claim will be dismissed without prejudice. If [Employee's
       attorney] informs the Court at the Status Conference that his client requests
       an Initial (Scheduling) Hearing, the Court will schedule this claim for a
       Compensation Hearing.

In the order on appeal, the trial court addressed the January 13, 2016 order and concluded
it did not mandate a dismissal of Employee's claims, stating "the condition precedent in
the order for the Court's imposition of the five-day deadline to file Requests for
Expedited Hearing never occurred; therefore, the Court was not under a self-imposed
mandate to dismiss [Employee's] claims because he did not file Requests for Expe~ited
Hearings within a deadline that never came into effect."

        The January 13, 2016 orders were interlocutory in nature and did not resolve all of
the issues or claims before the trial court. Thus, they were subject to revision by the trial
court at any time before entry of a final order. See Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.02 (An "order or
other fonn of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of the judgment
adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties."). Here, the trial
court did not modify the January 13, 2016 order; rather, it interpreted its own order as not
requiring dismissal of Employee's claims on the sole basis of Employee's not requesting
an expedited hearing. Not knowing the "totality of the circumstances" as communicated
or represented by the parties in the January 12, 2016 or January 29, 2016 hearings, we
cannot say that the trial court erred in interpreting its own orders and denying the SIF's
motion to alter or amend the February 5, 2016 status conference orders, or in denying the
SIF's motion to dismiss Employee's claims.

                                Discretion to Control Docket

        Before concluding, we must address the trial court's observations that "a majority"
of the Appeals Board in Smith v. The Newman Group, No. 2015-08-0075, 2015 TN Wrk.
Comp. App. Bd. LEXIS 30 (Tenn. Workers' Comp. App. Bd. Sept. 21, 2015), held that
trial courts have the discretion to control their dockets. Specifically, the trial court
observed that "a majority of the Appeals Board held [in Smith] that trial judges in the
Court of Workers' Compensation Claims possess discretion to control the pace of
litigation in their courts to ensure equitable and efficient disposition of the claims
litigated therein." The trial court reiterated the point a second time, noting that "the
majority in Smith held that a workers' compensation trial judge has broad discretion to
manage its docket."



                                               11
        While we were divided in Smith as to whether the trial court acted within its
discretion in denying an employer's motion to dismiss following a show cause hearing,
the observations made by the trial judge in this case reflect an overly narrow
construction of our views expressed in Smith. Consistent with well-established law, we
were then, and are now, unanimous in our belief that a trial court has the necessary
discretion to control the pace of litigation through the use of case supervision and docket
              7
management. But we are also unanimous that such discretion is not without its limits.
In Smith, we differed over where the discretionary line should be drawn under the
particular circumstances presented in that case, but not over whether such discretion
exists.

                                            Conclusion

        For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying
Transco Products' motion to dismiss Employee's claim or in denying the SIF's motions
to alter or amend the status conference orders or to dismiss Employee's claims. We
additionally conclude that the trial court's decisions did not violate any of the standards
set forth in Tennessee Code Annotated section 50-6-217(a)(3). Accordingly, the trial
court's decisions are affirmed and these consolidated cases are remanded for any further
proceedings that may be necessary.

                        Concurring Opinion - Filed July 27, 2016


       I concur with the conclusions in the lead opinion that the trial court did not err in
denying the motions at issue. Additionally, as noted in the lead opinion, the Appeals
Board is unanimous in our belief that a trial court has the necessary discretion to control
the pace of litigation through the use of case supervision and docket management and in
our belief that such discretion is not without its limits.

        I write separately to express my opinion that it was error for the trial court to
analyze Transco Products’ motion to dismiss under Rule 12.02(6) of the Tennessee Rules
of Civil Procedure. In my opinion, the appropriate procedure Transco Products should
have followed to present its disputed issue would have included (1) properly identifying
the issue in the dispute certification notice filed with the Bureau, and (2) requesting that


                                             1
the trial court hear its dispute on an expedited basis in accordance with Tennessee Code
Annotated section 50-6-239(d) (2015).

       Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 0800-02-21-.02(19) defines a petition for benefit
determination as a “request for the [Bureau] to provide assistance in the resolution of any
disputed issues in a workers’ compensation claim.” It further provides that “[a]ny party
may file a petition for benefit determination, on a form approved by the [Bureau], with
the [Bureau] at any time after a dispute arises in a claim for workers’ compensation
benefits.” Id. The form approved by the Bureau provides a checklist from which the
petitioner can select the type of relief being requested, and it includes an area for the
petitioner to explain any disputed issues in addition to providing information about the
employee, the employer, the injury, the insurance carrier, and whether the Second Injury
Fund is involved. Although the Appeals Board has equated a petition for benefit
determination to a complaint filed with the clerk of the court to commence a civil action,
see Duck v. Cox Oil Co., No. 2015-07-0089, 2016 TN Wrk. Comp. App. Bd. LEXIS 2
(Tenn. Workers’ Comp. App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2016), it is essentially a fill-in-the-blank
document and checklist intended to initiate a request that the Bureau provide assistance in
resolving disputed issues in a workers’ compensation claim.

        Once a petition for benefit determination has been filed, the parties are required to
participate in alternative dispute resolution measures designed to help the parties resolve
claims by agreement. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 50-6-236(b) (2015). If the parties are
unable to reach an agreement, the mediator prepares and issues a dispute certification
notice, “setting forth all unresolved issues for hearing before a workers’ compensation
judge.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 50-6-236(d)(1). However, “[n]o party is entitled to a hearing
before a workers’ compensation judge to determine temporary or permanent benefits . . .
unless a workers’ compensation mediator has issued a dispute certification notice setting
forth the issues for adjudication by a workers’ compensation judge.” Tenn. Code Ann. §
50-6-236(d)(3)(A). See also Tenn. Code Ann. § 50-6-203(a) (“No request for a hearing
by a workers’ compensation judge . . . shall be filed with the court of workers’
compensation claims, other than a request for settlement approval, until a workers’
compensation mediator has issued a dispute certification notice certifying issues in
dispute for hearing before a workers’ compensation judge.”).

        Tennessee Code Annotated section 50-6-239(a) provides the procedure for “a
party seeking further resolution of disputed issues” to present those issues to the workers’
compensation judge. This section provides that such party “shall file a request for a
hearing,” and subdivision 50-6-239(b)(1) limits the issues that may be presented to those
“issues that have been certified by a workers’ compensation mediator within a dispute
certification notice.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 50-6-239(a), (b)(1) (2015). Here, Transco
Products identified “compensability” as an issue in the dispute certification notice, but it
did not include as a defense or as a disputed issue whether the petition for benefit
determination fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Instead of

                                             2
requesting an expedited hearing to resolve the disputes identified in the dispute
certification notice, Transco Products filed a separate motion to dismiss grounded in Rule
12 of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure, which presented an issue that was not
included or identified in the dispute certification notice. In its brief on appeal, it asserts
that “[t]o test the sufficiency of Employee’s pleading, [it] filed a Motion to Dismiss to
determine whether Employee has set forth a valid claim for which relief can be granted.”

       Tennessee Code Annotated section 50-6-239(c)(1) provides that the Tennessee
Rules of Civil Procedure “shall govern proceedings at all hearings before a workers’
compensation judge unless an alternate procedural . . . rule has been adopted by the
administrator.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 50-6-239(c)(1) (emphasis added). “[T]he phrase
‘proceedings at all hearings’ as used in section 50-6-239(c)(1) encompasses all filings
made by the parties as a result of any request for or notice of a hearing filed after the
issuance of a dispute certification notice.” Syph v. Choice Food Group, Inc., No. 2015-
06-0288, 2016 TN Wrk. Comp. App. Bd. LEXIS 18, at *13 (Tenn. Workers’ Comp. App.
Bd. Apr. 21, 2016). The filing with the Bureau of both a petition for benefit
determination by any party and an initial dispute certification notice by a workers’
compensation mediator occurs prior to any request for or notice of a hearing before the
Court of Workers’ Compensation Claims. Thus, the filing of these documents occurs
before the point in time at which the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure have attached to
the process. It necessarily follows that, at the time both a petition for benefit
determination and an initial dispute certification notice are filed, neither is subject to the
requirements applicable to a civil complaint or an answer to a civil complaint as
contemplated in the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure.

       In these consolidated cases, the analysis by both the trial court and in the lead
opinion applies the pleading requirements of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure to
Employee’s petition for benefit determination, but that analysis fails to address the
procedure established in the Reform Act for presenting disputed issues to the trial court,
focusing instead on whether the information in the petition for benefit determination
states a claim upon which relief can be granted. In my opinion, this is an incorrect
analysis. Neither analysis addressed whether Transco Products identified the issue in the
dispute certification notice or whether Transco Products initiated the appropriate
procedure for presenting the issue to the trial court by requesting an expedited hearing
pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 50-6-239(d). In my view, the purpose of
the expedited hearing process is to allow any party the opportunity to have the trial court
hear and resolve disputes over issues included in the dispute certification notice
concerning the provision of benefits. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 50-6-239(d)(1). Transco
Products failed to comply with section 50-6-239(a) when it did not request an expedited
hearing, and it avoided the prohibition in section 50-6-239(b) against presenting issues
not certified by the workers’ compensation mediator by filing a motion to dismiss under
Rule 12 of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure. While I agree that the motion to


                                              3
dismiss should have been denied, in my opinion, the trial court erred in analyzing
Transco Products’ motion to dismiss based on Rule 12.02(6).

642 F.Supp. 860 (1986)
In re The EVENING NEWS ASSOCIATION TENDER OFFER LITIGATION.
This Document Relates To:
The COAST GUARD ACADEMY FOUNDATION, INC., Plaintiff,
v.
The EVENING NEWS ASSOCIATION, et al., Defendants.
No. 86-CV-72369, Master File No. 85-CV-74843.
United States District Court, E.D. Michigan, S.D.
August 20, 1986.

MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
FEIKENS, District Judge.
This is one of six consolidated cases in which plaintiffs claim that The Evening News Association ("ENA") and its directors violated state and federal laws by purchasing plaintiffs. ENA shares pursuant to a tender offer of $250 per share. The Coast Guard Academy Foundation ("Foundation") alleges that defendants violated Title IX of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 (commonly known as the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or "RICO"), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968, by sending the Foundation three letters during December, 1984 in a successful bid for the Foundation's one thousand ENA shares.[1] The Foundation is the only plaintiff alleging a RICO violation. Defendants move to dismiss the claim.
RICO liability is predicated on a "pattern of racketeering activity," 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a)-(c), which "requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity." 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). Even though the Foundation is admittedly challenging only one securities transaction, it claims to have satisfied the pattern requirement by treating *861 each of the three letters it received from ENA as a separately indictable mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1341.
I hold that a "pattern of racketeering activity" requires more than a single episode of racketeering activity even if the episode consists of more than one indictable act. The Foundation's interpretation transforms "garden variety" frauds and many commercial disputes into RICO cases, and flouts the purpose of Congress in enacting RICO "to seek the eradication of organized crime in the United States ... [and] to deal with the unlawful activities of those engaged in organized crime." Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, Pub.L. No. 91-452, 1970 U.S.Code Cong. & Ad. News 1073 (84 Stat. 922, 923).
In Sedima v. Imrex, ___ U.S. ___, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3285 n. 14, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985), the Supreme Court invited a rigorous interpretation and application of the pattern requirement:
The implication [of RICO's definition of a "pattern of racketeering activity"] is that while two acts are necessary, they may not be sufficient. Indeed, in common parlance two of anything do not generally form a "pattern."
Courts have accepted the invitation. In Modern Settings v. Prudential-Bache Securities, 629 F.Supp. 860 (S.D.N.Y.1986), plaintiffs alleged securities fraud and a RICO violation based on defendants' liquidation of plaintiffs' account. The court dismissed the RICO claim:
Plaintiffs insist that this liquidation consisting of the sale of various government-backed mortgage instruments and other securitiesconstitutes a "pattern of racketeering activity" [but] we have no difficulty in finding that this single episode of fraud ... is no pattern. Each of the multiple sales involved in the liquidation may indeed violate the securities laws; however, each is but part of a single transaction.

... There is no pattern of racketeering activity in the liquidation alone, regardless of the number of sales required to consummate it.

Modern Settings, 629 F.Supp. at 864 (emphasis added). See also Superior Oil v. Fulmer, 785 F.2d 252, 254-57 (8th Cir.1986) (reversing judgment for plaintiffs on a RICO claim where predicate acts proved were all part of a single fraudulent scheme); Northern Trust Bank v. Inryco, 615 F.Supp. 828, 831 (N.D.Ill.1985) (allegation of two mailings pursuant to a single scheme does not state a RICO claim because "`pattern' ... presumes repeated criminal activity, not merely repeated acts to carry out the same criminal activity.") (emphasis original); McIntyre's Mini Computer Sales Group v. Creative Synergy, 644 F.Supp. 580, 585 (E.D.Mich.1986) (Pratt, J.) (dismissing RICO claim where alleged predicate acts were all part of "the same criminal episode or transaction"); Zahra v. Charles, 639 F.Supp. 1405, 1409 (E.D. Mich.1986) (Pratt, J.) (same). But cf. R.A.G.S. Couture v. Hyatt, 774 F.2d 1350, 1355 (5th Cir.1985) (after noting that the District Court did not consider the issue, and without considering whether the alleged predicate acts were part of a single transaction, the Court holds that two allegedly fraudulent mailings can form a RICO pattern).[2]
Accordingly, defendants' motion to dismiss the Foundation's RICO claim is GRANTED.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
NOTES
[1]  The Foundation alleges "[o]n information and belief" that defendants sent three related letters during the first six months of 1985 to ENA shareholders. (Amended Complaint ¶¶ 27(d)-(f), 28(d)-(f), 29(d)-(f)). Since the Foundation was not a shareholder after December, 1984, it did not receive the letters.
[2]  Several Courts have criticized or rejected R.A. G.S. See Papagiannis v. Pontikis, 108 F.R.D. 177, 179 n. 3 (N.D.Ill.1986); Soper v. Simmons International, 632 F.Supp. 244, 250-54 (S.D.N.Y. 1986); Torwest DBC v. Dick, 628 F.Supp. 163, 167 (D.Colo.1986).

91 U.S. 559 (____)
HALL ET AL.
v.
UNITED STATES.
Supreme Court of United States.

Argued by Mr. Assistant Attorney-General Edwin B. Smith for defendants, and submitted on printed arguments by H.J. Horn for plaintiffs.
MR. JUSTICE CLIFFORD delivered the opinion of the court.
Fifteen hundred dollars per annum are allowed to collectors of internal revenue as salary for their services and that of their deputies, to be paid quarterly. Commissions, in addition to salary, are also allowed to such officers, to be computed upon the amounts by them respectively collected, paid over, and accounted for, under the instructions of the Treasury Department, as follows: Three per cent upon the first $100,000; one per centum upon all sums above $100,000, and not exceeding $400,000; and one-half of one per centum on all sums above $400,000. Such an officer may also keep and render to the proper officers of the treasury an account of his necessary and reasonable charges for stationery and blank-books used in the performance of his official duties, and for postage actually paid on letters and documents received or sent, and exclusively relating to official business; and, if the account is approved by the proper accounting officers, the collector is entitled to be paid for the same: but the provision is that no such account shall be approved, unless it shall state the date and the particular items of every such expenditure, and shall be verified by the oath or affirmation of the collector.
Two provisos are annexed to those enactments: (1.) That the *560 salary and commissions of no collector, exclusive of stationery, blank-books, and postage, shall exceed $10,000 in the aggregate, nor more than $5,000, exclusive of the expenses for rent, stationery, blank-books, and postage, and pay of deputies and clerks, to which such collector is actually and necessarily subjected in the administration of his office. (2.) That the Secretary of the Treasury be authorized to make such further allowances from time to time, as may be reasonable, in cases in which, from the territorial extent of the district, or from the amount of internal duties collected, or from other circumstances, it may seem just to make such allowances. 13 Stat. 231.
Sufficient appears to show that the principal defendant was duly appointed a collector of internal revenue under the act of Congress in that case made and provided, and that the foundation of the suit is the official bond given by the appointee for the faithful discharge of the duties of the office. Breaches of the conditions of the bond having been committed, as alleged, the United States commenced an action of debt in the District Court against the principal and his sureties, claiming the penalties of the bond. Service was made; and the defendants appeared, and pleaded (1.) non est factum; (2.) performance; (3.) set-off in the sum of $8,203.06 for money before that time advanced, paid, laid out, and expended by the defendant to and for the use of the plaintiffs, and at their instance, for the work and labor of the defendant and his servants and deputies, done and performed by him, as such collector, for the plaintiffs, and at their instance and request.
Claim is also made for the same sum in the same plea, upon the ground that it was due and owing to the defendant from the plaintiffs for commissions, expenses, and charges for extra services of himself and his servants, done and performed at the special instance and request of the plaintiffs.
Issue was joined by the plaintiffs upon the first plea; and to the second the plaintiffs reply, and deny that the defendant has well and truly performed the conditions of the writing obligatory, and assign the following breaches: (1.) That he has not accounted for and paid over to the United States all the public moneys which came into his hands, in compliance with the orders and regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury. *561 (2.) That he did not faithfully execute and perform all the duties of his office, as more fully set forth in the replication.
Both parties, having waived a trial by jury, went to trial before the court without a jury; and the finding and judgment were for the plaintiffs, in the sum of $11,517.63. Exceptions were filed by the defendants; and they sued out a writ of error, and removed the case into the Circuit Court.
Due settlement of the collector's accounts had been made by the accounting officers of the treasury; and the plaintiffs, to support the issues on their part, introduced the certified transcript of the same, to which the defendants objected: but the court overruled the objection, and admitted the evidence; and the defendants excepted. Said transcript included the statement of differences, and showed that the sum of $20,120 was the balance due from the collector.
Collections, it seems, had been made by the officer, for the preceding year, amounting to $77,702.08; and it did not appear that he had been paid during that period any extra allowance above his salary and commissions, nor that any of the charges claimed as set-off had been credited in the settlement of his accounts. Apart from that, it was admitted by the plaintiffs that the defendants had paid into court the sum of $11,435.17, which is to be deducted from the balance found due from the defendants by the accounting officers of the treasury.
Set-offs were claimed by the defendants, as follows: (1.) $5,010 paid by the collector, during the summer and fall of 1866, to sixteen deputy-collectors employed by him during that period in his district. (2.) $648 paid for the hire of clerks in his office during the quarter ending Sept. 30 of the same year. (3.) $1,100 paid for hire of clerks in making out his accounts and returns during that and the succeeding year.
Nothing being alleged to the contrary, it will be assumed that those several claims had been duly presented to the proper officers of the treasury, and that they had been finally disallowed. They were separately offered in evidence at the trial; and the ruling of the court in each instance was, that the same was properly rejected by the accounting officers of the treasury. Seasonable exception to the ruling of the court was taken by *562 the defendants. Appearance was entered by each party in the Circuit Court, and they were both there heard; and the Circuit Court affirmed the judgment of the District Court, and the defendants sued out the present writ of error.
Errors have not been assigned, as required by the rules of the court; but the course of the argument, as exhibited in the printed brief, warrants the conclusion that the only errors relied on are the rulings of the District Court, that the accounts filed in set-off were properly rejected by the accounting officers of the treasury. Defendant litigants had no right to file accounts in set-off at common law; nor did they ever have that right until the passage of the statute of 2 Geo. II., ch. 24, sect. 4, which enacted, in substance and effect, that, where there were mutual debts between the plaintiff and the defendant, one debt may be set against the other, and that such matter may be given in evidence under the general issue, or may be pleaded in bar, so that notice shall be given of the sum or debt intended to be offered in evidence. Chit. on Contr. 948.
Questions of the kind, where the United States are plaintiffs, must be determined wholly by the acts of Congress, as the local laws have no application in such cases. United States v. Eckford, 6 Wall. 490; United States v. Robeson, 9 Pet. 324; Conklin, Treat. 127.
Judgment in such suits is required to be rendered at the return term, unless the defendant shall, in open court, make oath or affirmation that he is equitably entitled to credits which had not been, previous to the commencement of the suit, submitted to the consideration of the accounting officers of the treasury and rejected, and specifying each particular claim so rejected in the affidavit. 1 Stat. 515; United States v. Giles, 9 Cranch, 236; 5 Stat. 83.
Sect. 4 of the same act provides, that, in suits between the United States and individuals, no claim for a credit shall be admitted at the trial, except such as shall appear to have been submitted to the accounting officers of the treasury for their examination, and to have been by them disallowed, unless it shall appear that the defendant, at the time of the trial, is in possession of vouchers not before in his power to procure, and that he was prevented from exhibiting a claim for such credit *563 at the treasury by absence from the United States, or some unavoidable accident.
Claims for credit in suits against persons indebted to the United States, if it appears that the claim had previously been presented to the accounting officers of the treasury for their examination, and had been by them disallowed in whole or in part, may be admitted upon the trial of the suit; but it can only be admitted as a claim for credit, and must be proved to be just and legal before it can be allowed. Equitable claims for credit, if falling within the latter clause of the fourth section of that act, may be admitted at the trial of such a suit, though never presented to and disallowed at the treasury; but the presentation of such a claim will amount to nothing, unless it is proved that the same is justly due to the claimant.
Due returns, it seems, were made by the collector. It is not questioned that his accounts were regularly settled by the accounting officers of the treasury; nor is it suggested that due credit was not given to him for every thing which he could properly claim, except for the extra services and expenses charged in the accounts filed in set-off; and it appears that those accounts were duly presented to the accounting officers of the treasury, and were by them rejected before the suit was instituted. When the claims were offered, the court admitted the evidence; and the only complaint is, that the court ruled that the claims were properly rejected by the accounting officers of the treasury, which is the only question presented for decision.
Independent of the second proviso to the section defining the compensation to be allowed to such collectors, it would be clear beyond every doubt that no claim of the kind could be allowed by any court, as appears from the acts of Congress upon the subject and the decisions of this court. Legislation upon the subject commenced with respect to collectors of the customs, but was ultimately extended to all executive officers with fixed salaries, or whose compensation was prescribed by law. Sect. 18 of the act of the 7th of May, 1822, provided that no collector, surveyor, or naval officer shall ever receive more than $400 annually, exclusive of his compensation as such officer, and the fines and forfeitures allowed by law for any service he may render in any other office or capacity. 3 Stat. 696.
*564 Prior to that, the settled practice and usage were to require collectors to superintend lights and light-houses in their districts, and to disburse money for the revenue-cutter service. Services of the kind were charged as extra services, and extra compensation was in many cases allowed for such service, until Congress interfered, and by that act gave such officers a fixed compensation, subject to the provision that they should never receive more than $400, exclusive of the fixed compensation, and their due proportion of fines, penalties, and forfeitures. Officers not named in that act also received fixed salaries; and they, whenever they performed extra service under the direction of the head of a department, claimed extra compensation. Claims of the kind were in some instances disallowed; and in certain cases, where litigation ensued, it was decided by this court that such claims were a proper set-off to the money demands of the United States. Miner v. United States, 15 Pet. 423; Gratiot v. United States, id. 336; United States v. Ripley, 7 id. 18.
Litigations of the kind became frequent; and Congress again interfered, and provided that no officer in any branch of the public service, or any other person whose salary or whose pay or emoluments is or are fixed by law and regulations, shall receive any extra allowance or compensation, in any form whatever, for the disbursement of public money or the performance of any other service, unless the said extra allowance or compensation be authorized by law. 5 Stat. 349.
Since then many other acts of Congress have been passed upon the subject, of which one more only will be reproduced. Like the preceding act, it provides that no officer in any branch of the public service, or any other person whose salary, pay, or emoluments is or are fixed by law or regulations, shall receive any additional pay, extra allowance, or compensation, in any form whatever, for the disbursement of public money, or for any other service or duty whatever, unless the same shall be authorized by law; and the appropriation therefor is explicitly set forth that it is for such additional pay, extra allowance, or compensation. 5 Stat. 510; 9 id. 297, 365, 367, 504, 542, 543, 629; 10 id. 97-100, 119, 120.
Compensation for extra services, where no certain sum is *565 fixed by law, cannot be allowed by the head of a department to any officer who has by law a fixed or certain compensation for his services in the office he holds, unless such head of a department is thereto authorized by an act of Congress; nor can any compensation for extra services be allowed by the court or jury as a set-off, in a suit brought by the United States against any officer for public money in his hands, unless it appears that the head of the department was authorized by an act of Congress to appoint an agent to perform the extra service, that the compensation to be paid for the service was fixed by law, that the service to be performed had respect to matters wholly outside of the duties appertaining to the office held by the agent, and that the money to pay for the extra services had been appropriated by Congress. Converse v. United States, 21 How. 470.
None of the conditions precedent suggested existed in the case before the court; and it follows that no such allowance could have been made by the accounting officers of the treasury in settling the accounts of the principal defendant, unless the same had been previously approved by the Secretary of the Treasury, under the second proviso in the twenty-fifth section of the act prescribing the compensation to be allowed to the collectors of internal revenue. 13 Stat. 232.
Authority is there given to the Secretary of the Treasury to make such further allowances to such collectors, from time to time, as may be reasonable; but the power to be exercised in that behalf is one vested in his discretion, both as to time and amount. He may make an allowance one year, and refuse it the next, or he may never make it at all, as to him may seem just and reasonable. No appeal lies from his decision in that regard, either to the accounting officers of the treasury or to the courts. Instead of that his decision is final, unless reversed by Congress.
Judgment affirmed.

Before JOHNSON, C.J., and REAVIS and CAMPBELL, JJ.

MEMORANDUM OPINION

Appellant Nediem Mahmoud Saadeddine appeals from a conviction and sentence in the 163
rd
 District Court of Orange County, Texas (the trial court), for aggravated sexual assault.  His appellate attorney has filed a brief indicating that in counsel’s opinion, the appeal is meritless.  
See
 
Anders v. California
, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967)
.  In the introduction to the 
Anders
 brief, counsel recites that appellant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault.  In the Statement of the Nature and Result of the Case however, counsel states that appellant was indicted for the offense of burglary of a habitation.  The clerk’s record shows that appellant was indicted for an incident on or about September 20, 2000
.  Appellant’s brief recites that the burglary of a habitation occurred on September 27, 1997.  The brief recites that appellant pled guilty on April 11, 2001, while the reporter’s record shows that the guilty plea occurred on April 9, 2001.  

The substantive portion of appellant’s brief is one page.  An additional page contains counsel’s certification that he has diligently reviewed the record, formed the opinion that the appeal is without merit, and that he has advised appellant of appellant’s rights.  

Prior to concluding that an appeal is frivolous, appellate counsel must make a diligent and thorough evaluation of the case.  
See
 
McCoy v. Court of Appeals of Wisconsin, Dist. 1
, 486 U.S. 429, 438, 108 S.Ct. 1895, 100 L.Ed.2d 440 (1988).  
The appellate lawyer must master the trial record, thoroughly research the law, and exercise judgment in identifying the arguments that may be advanced on appeal.  
Id
.  If the attorney determines there are no arguments to be made on behalf of the client, the attorney is required to so advise the appellate court and seek leave to withdraw as counsel.  
See
 
id.
 at 438-439, 108 S.Ct. 1895.

The brief filed on behalf of appellant does not show that counsel has fulfilled his duties to his client.  At a minimum, the brief demonstrates that counsel either has not exercised diligence in thoroughly researching and mastering the record, or has not exercised diligence in formulating and exhibiting in the appellate brief that he has researched and mastered the record.

Counsel has set out his professional opinion that the appeal does not have merit.  He has not, however, filed a motion to withdraw.  

This appeal is abated and the cause is remanded to the trial court.  Upon remand, the judge of the trial court is directed to replace appellant’s current counsel with new appellate counsel.  

The trial court is directed to: (1) conduct any necessary hearings; (2) if any hearings are held, to make and file appropriate findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommendations, and cause them to be included in a supplemental clerk’s record; (3) enter any orders appropriate; (4) cause any hearing proceedings to be transcribed and included in a reporter’s record; and (5) have a record of the proceedings made to the extent any of the proceedings are not included in the supplemental clerk’s record or the reporter’s record.  In the absence of a request for extension of time from the trial court, the supplemental clerk’s record, reporter’s record, and any additional proceeding records, including any orders, findings, conclusions and recommendations, are to be sent so as to be received by the clerk of this court not later than September 19, 2003.

1
MERRITT, Circuit Judge, delivering the opinion for the Court.


2
We voted to reconsider en banc this unfair labor practice case primarily to decide the question of whether NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 614, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 1940, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969), should be interpreted to require the National Labor Relations Board, prior to the issuance of a bargaining order, to make explicit findings and conclusions respecting the inadequacy of a new election or other less onerous remedies for correcting unfair labor practices committed by an employer during a union election campaign.1   We now conclude that we lack jurisdiction of this question under Woelke & Romero Framing, Inc. v. NLRB, 456 U.S. 645, 102 S.Ct. 2071, 72 L.Ed.2d 398 (1982), and section 10(e) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 160(e) (1976), because this specific issue was not raised before the Board prior to its decision, or upon reconsideration.2   The jurisdictional issue was not raised by the NLRB before the panel of this Court whose decision, 715 F.2d 1069 (6th Cir.1983), was vacated by our en banc order.  We, therefore, must pretermit the question that we granted an en banc hearing to decide.  For the same basic reasons stated by the panel decision, we find substantial evidence in the record to support the Board's unfair labor practices findings and conclusions.  We also find that there is evidence from which the NLRB could find that the general test stated by the Supreme Court in Gissel for the entry of a bargaining order is satisfied.3   Accordingly, the Board's order is enforced.


3
KRUPANSKY, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.


4
I agree with the majority that pursuant to Woelke Romero Framing, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 456 U.S. 645, 102 S.Ct. 2071, 72 L.Ed.2d 398 (1982), this court is without jurisdiction to review the Board's compliance with the Supreme Court mandate enunciated in N.L.R.B. v. Gissel, 395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969) in imposing the contested bargaining order in this case because the petitioner failed to assert this issue during the proceedings before the Board.  I further concur with the majority that this Court has jurisdiction to review the Board's determination that Southern Moldings Inc. committed the unfair labor practices with which it was charged and that the administrative record incorporates substantial evidence to support the Board's conclusion that Southern Moldings Inc. violated the Act.


5
I write separately because I am not in accord with the obiter dictum contained in the majority opinion's penultimate sentence namely that the United States v. Gissel criteria was satisfied.  Having initially concluded that this very issue was beyond the court's authority to review in light of the pronounced jurisdictional defect it is inappropriate for the court to thereafter comment on the merits of the assignment of error which was improperly submitted for appellate review.


6
WELLFORD, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.


7
I concur with the conclusion set out by Judge Merritt that Woelke & Romero Framing, Inc. v. NLRB, 456 U.S. 645, 102 S.Ct. 2071, 72 L.Ed.2d 398 (1982), neither argued before nor called to the attention of the panel which considered this case prior to the en banc hearing, precludes our consideration of what I believe to be inadequate and insufficient findings and conclusion of the Board to justify the extraordinary remedy of ordering petitioner to bargain with the intervenor union, which lost the election in controversy.


8
To the extent the Board considered the failure of the petitioner to raise wages of its employees while the election campaign was in progress, but later did so consistent with petitioner's commitment, as a basis for the bargaining order, I must respectfully dissent.  I also cannot agree that the "possibility of erasing the effects of past practices and of ensuing a fair election (or a fair rerun) by the use of traditional remedies ... is slight" in this case.    NLRB v. Gissel, 395 U.S. 575, 614, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 1940, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969) (as cited in footnote 1 of the majority opinion).  Rather, for the reasons set out in my dissent in the panel opinion in this case filed August 23, 1983, I would find no substantial basis for concluding that a fair election cannot be held utilizing traditional Board remedies.



1
 In Gissel, the Court referred to the findings necessary for the issuance of such an order only in general language:
"In fashioning a remedy in the exercise of its discretion, then, the Board can properly take into consideration the extensiveness of an employer's unfair practices in terms of their past effect on election conditions and the likelihood of their recurrence in the future.  If the Board finds that the possibility of erasing the effects of past practices and of ensuring a fair election (or a fair rerun) by the use of traditional remedies, though present, is slight and that employee sentiment once expressed through cards would, on balance, be better protected by a bargaining order, then such an order should issue.
395 U.S. at 614-15, 89 S.Ct. at 1940-41.


2
 In Woelke, Justice Marshall wrote for a unanimous court:
[T]he Court of Appeals was without jurisdiction to consider that question [a picketing issue].  The issue was not raised during the proceedings before the Board, either by the General Counsel or by Woelke.  Thus, judicial review is barred by Sec. 10(e) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 160(e), which provides that "[n]o objection that has not been urged before the Board ... shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances...."  Woelke could have objected to the Board's decision in a petition for reconsideration or rehearing.  The failure to do so prevents consideration of the question by the courts.

Before GEE, POLITZ and WILLIAMS, Circuit Judges.
PER CURIAM:


1
Nolen appeals the award of an injunction against him, advancing various contentions that we discuss below.

Facts

2
Molex Incorporated, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Illinois, makes cable assemblies.  In 1978, Molex hired James Nolen, a Texas citizen, as its sales representative in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.  Tandy Corporation is a large electronics firm located in that area.  Nolen's job required him to try to sell Molex's cable assemblies to Tandy, which he succeeded in doing.  Once Tandy was established as a Molex customer, Nolen, as the Molex sales representative responsible for the Tandy account, was also responsible for maintaining a good relationship between the two companies.


3
In mid-1980, Molex began to have problems delivering its cable assemblies to Tandy.  In November of that year, Nolen had formed a company first called Western Controls, and later called Western Cable (Western).  Through Western, Nolen sold cable assemblies directly to Tandy--assemblies made from Molex parts.  Nolen paid for the parts with checks signed "James Baucom."    There was no "James Baucom" at Western;  Nolen admits to forging all of these signatures.  Nolen also used the name "James Baucom" when selling the Western cable assemblies to Tandy.  These (and other) deceptions were necessary because Nolen had omitted to resign from Molex before beginning his career as the sole proprietor of Western.  His double life thus enabled Nolen to receive a commission from Molex for the Molex parts he sold to himself as Western, and then to receive the profits from the cable assemblies he sold to Tandy;  his knowledge of Molex's pricing made it possible for Nolen (acting as Western) to undersell Molex.  On occasion, Nolen charged Molex for business lunches with his doppelganger James Baucom;  "Baucom" was leasing cable manufacturing tools from Molex.


4
In July 1981, having established Western as Tandy's cable assembly supplier, Nolen left Molex.  He continued to purchase Molex parts, and to sell cable assemblies to Tandy, as "Baucom;"  between November 1980 and December 1983, Nolen's sales of cable assemblies totalled $1.7 million.


5
When Molex discovered Nolen's perfidy, it brought an action against him alleging diversion of corporate opportunity, unfair competition, and interference with contractual and business relationships.  Molex sought money damages and an injunction barring Nolen from dealing with Molex customers and from disclosing Molex information or parting with Molex property.  Nolen defended this action by various means, means that included perjury;  he now admits to having lied at his deposition.  The case was tried to a jury.  It found for Molex and awarded Molex both actual and exemplary damages.  Molex is unlikely to collect these damages because Nolen has taken voluntary bankruptcy.  The trial court entered judgment on the jury's verdict and issued an injunction permanently barring Nolen from selling cable assemblies to Tandy.  Nolen now appeals both the judgment and the injunction.

Analysis

6
Nolen first contends that the trial court's injunction is impermissibly vague, overbroad, and beyond the scope of the pleadings.  Except in one respect, this contention is meritless.  Nolen's first assertion of vagueness is grounded on the trial court's failure to define "cable assemblies."    No definition was necessary;  Nolen knows full well what cable assemblies are.  The trial court was required simply to "frame its injunction so that those enjoined will know what conduct the court has prohibited."   Meyer v. Brown & Root Construction Co., 661 F.2d 369, 373 (5th Cir.1981), citing International Longshoremen's Assoc. v. Philadelphia Marine Trade Assoc., 389 U.S. 64, 76, 88 S.Ct. 201, 208, 19 L.Ed.2d 236 (1967).  This the trial court did.


7
Nolen argues that the injunction is overbroad because it is not limited to the specific Tandy divisions to which Nolen sold Molex cable assemblies.  He provides no authority for this argument, probably because there is none.  Texas courts have routinely permitted injunctions to issue barring employees from soliciting the customers of their former employers;  see, e.g., Stocks v. Banner American Corp., 599 S.W.2d 665, 668 (Tex.Civ.App.--Texarkana 1980, no writ);  Johnson v. American Speedreading Academy, Inc., 526 S.W.2d 163, 166 (Tex.Civ.App.--Dallas 1975).  This Court approved such an injunction in Zoecon Industries v. American Stockman Tag Co., 713 F.2d 1174, 1180 (5th Cir.1983).  The trial court was thus fully within its discretion in barring Nolen from selling cable assemblies to Tandy, indubitably a customer of Nolen's former employer.


8
Nolen also argues that the injunction is overbroad because it is not limited to those sorts of cable assemblies manufactured by Molex.  He cites Norton v. Integral Corp., 584 S.W.2d 932, 935 (Tex.Civ.App.--Austin, 1979), in support of this argument.  In Norton, however, the language held overbroad was "electrical equipment in the center pivot sprinkler industry," 584 S.W.2d at 935.  The Norton court ordered it changed to "cable con."    "Cable con" is obviously no more specific, and no narrower, than "cable assembly."    Nolen's argument is therefore without supporting authority;  it was not error for the trial court to bar him from selling "cable assemblies."Nolen further contends that the injunction should be lifted because it deprives him of a livelihood and because it is against the public interest.  Both contentions are frivolous, and patently unworthy of serious consideration.  It is also unnecessary to discuss whether (or how) the injunction goes beyond the scope of the pleading:  the assertion appears only in the caption to this section of Nolen's brief and is not mentioned at all in the text.


9
We do find merit in one complaint of vagueness:  the injunction forbids Nolen to deal in various respects with "Tandy Corporation or any affiliate or subsidiary of Tandy Corporation...."  The phrase is mildly ambiguous;  we reform it to read "or any affiliate or subsidiary of Tandy Corporation as of the date of this judgment, March 9, 1984."    Except in this minor respect, we conclude that the trial court's injunction was neither vague nor overbroad, and no reasonable reader of the record could conclude that it went beyond the scope of the pleadings.


10
Nolen next assigns as error the trial court's grant of a permanent injunction;  he contends that the injunction should have been limited in duration.  The only relevant authority cited in connection with this contention is Hyde Corp. v. Huffines, 158 Tex. 566, 314 S.W.2d 763 (1958).  Nolen imaginatively construes Hyde to mandate the grant of a limited, rather than a permanent, injunction whenever the defendant has requested one.  Both common sense and the actual language of Hyde refute this novel construction:


11
The trial judge upon proper findings has correctly determined that this is a case for injunctive relief.  He has ordered that the usual equitable order issue, e.g. the perpetual injunction.    It would seem to follow that if an injunction of limited duration be substituted therefore ..., an abuse of discretion in issuing the perpetual injunction would have to be shown.  No such showing was made in this case.


12
314 S.W.2d at 780-81 (citation omitted) (emphasis added).  Nolen has made no such showing either.  His conduct is indistinguishable in any relevant aspect from that of the defendants in Zoecon and in Elcor Chemical Corp. v. Agri-Sul, Inc., 494 S.W.2d 204 (Tex.Civ.App.--Dallas 1973, writ ref'd n.r.e.);    permanent injunctions were upheld in both cases.  These cases, and the absence of countervailing authority, clearly indicate that the trial court was well within its authority in granting a permanent injunction to Molex.


13
Nolen's last attack on the injunction is similarly baseless;  his assertion that the injunction was issued without a finding of irreparable harm is simply wrong.  The trial court explicitly made such a finding.


14
Nolen makes various assignments of error in connection with the trial court's finding of irreparable harm.  The first, that there was no such finding, is refuted above.  The last, that the injunction is defective absent a finding of irreparable harm, is irrefutable as a general proposition but inapplicable to this case.  The rest are not entirely clear, but seem to allege first, that no evidence existed to support a finding of irreparable harm, and second, that the issue of irreparable harm should have been submitted to the jury.  The first contention is frivolous.  Although Nolen acknowledges irreparable harm to be a question of fact, he appears to believe that our review of the trial court's finding of this fact is governed by something other than the clearly erroneous standard of Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Civ.P.  His belief is itself clearly erroneous.   Bryan v. Kershaw, 366 F.2d 497, 499 (5th Cir.1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 959, 87 S.Ct. 1030, 18 L.Ed.2d 108 (1967).  The trial court's finding is clearly correct.  Under Texas law, the irreparable harm required for a permanent injunction is defined as "an injury which cannot be compensated or for which compensation cannot be measured by any certain pecuniary standard."   Parkem Industrial Services, Inc. v. Garton, 619 S.W.2d 428, 430 (Tex.Civ.App.--Amarillo 1981).  Nolen's bankruptcy meets the first prong of his definition;  Texas cases construe "cannot be compensated" to include situations in which the "defendant is incapable of responding in damages."   R.H. Sanders Corp. v. Haves, 541 S.W.2d 262, 265 (Tex.Civ.App.--Dallas 1976, no writ), citing County of Harris v. Southern Pacific Transportation Co., 457 S.W.2d 336, 339 (Tex.Civ.App.--Houston 1970, no writ);  Grayson Enterprises, Inc. v. Texas Key Broadcasters, Inc., 388 S.W.2d 204, 208 (Tex.Civ.App.--Eastland 1965, no writ).


15
Nolen's theft of Molex's customer Tandy meets the second prong of the definition.  In Jeter v. Associated Rack Corp., 607 S.W.2d 272 (Tex.Civ.App.--Texarkana 1980), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 965, 102 S.Ct. 507, 70 L.Ed.2d 381 (1981), the court affirmed permanent injunctive relief on facts very similar to these, stating "[i]t is our further opinion that future damages would have been difficult if not impossible to ascertain and thus the trial court was justified in granting injunctive relief."    607 S.W.2d at 278.  Although they do not contain language paralleling that of Jeter, cases such as Zoecon, Hyde, and Elcor, in which permanent injunctive relief was affirmed, plainly support the proposition that irreparable harm may be shown in customer theft situations.  Given these authorities, and the peculiarly aggravated circumstances of this case, it cannot be said that the trial court's finding of irreparable harm was clearly erroneous.


16
Nolen next complains that the issue of irreparable harm should have been submitted to the jury;  as a question of fact it certainly could have been.   Miller v. Lone Star Tavern, Inc., 593 S.W.2d 341, 344 (Tex.Civ.App.--Waco 1979).  Our review of the record reveals, however, that Nolen neither requested submission of the issue to the jury nor objected to the absence of the issue in the special interrogatories given to the jury.  Rule 49(a), Fed.R.Civ.P., therefore bars Nolen's assignment of error on this point.  That rule provides as follows:


17
The court may require a jury to return only a special verdict in the form of a special written finding upon each issue of fact.  In that event the court may submit to the jury written questions susceptible of categorical or other brief answer or may submit written forms of the several special findings which might properly be made under the pleadings and evidence;  or it may use such other method of submitting the issues and requiring the written findings thereon as it deems most appropriate.  The court shall give to the jury such explanation and instruction concerning the matter thus submitted as may be necessary to enable the jury to make its findings upon each issue.  If in so doing the court omits any issue of fact raised by the pleadings or by the evidence, each party waives his right to a trial by jury of the issue so omitted unless before the jury retires he demands its submission to the jury.    As to an issue omitted without such demand the court may make a finding;  or, if it fails to do so, it shall be deemed to have made a finding in accord with the judgment on the special verdict.


18
The Rule is unambiguous and this Court has given its words their plain meaning.   See, e.g., John R. Lewis, Inc. v. Newman, 446 F.2d 800, 804-05 (5th Cir.1971).  Under Rule 49(a) and our cases construing it, Nolen waived his right to a jury trial on the issue of irreparable harm.


19
Nolen's attack on the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury findings against him is completely without merit.  The standard of review used by this Court to evaluate allegations of insufficient evidence was explained in a recent case:


20
The role of this Court is not to adjudicate the facts de novo, nor is it our task to second-guess the conclusion of the members of the jury who had the important opportunity to evaluate the demeanor of the witnesses.  The appellants urge that there is substantial evidence to support judgment in their favor.  This may or may not be the case, but the contention is not germane.  The record shows clear and substantial evidence to support the jury's findings for appellee.  The facts and inferences do not "point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of one party that the Court believes that reasonable men could not arrive at a contrary verdict...."  Boeing Co. v. Shipman, 411 F.2d 365, 374 (5th Cir.1969) (en banc).  The trial judge therefore acted properly in denying the motion for directed verdict and in entering judgment consistent with the jury's verdict.


21
Thomas v. City of New Orleans, 687 F.2d 80, 83 (5th Cir.1982);  see also NCH Corp. v. Broyles, 749 F.2d 247 (5th Cir.1985).  Nolen points to no specific portions of the record as supporting his contentions.  Our review of it reveals that in no respect does it fail to support the jury findings.  Those findings, and the relevant evidence are summarized as follows.


22
a) Nolen acquired trade secrets or confidential business information from Molex.  The information Nolen acquired from Molex about Tandy and other Molex customers falls within the category of either trade secrets or confidential information, as does the information he acquired about Molex's pricing.    Zoecon, Hyde, Elcor, supra.


23
b) Nolen misappropriated and used Molex's trade secrets or confidential business information for his own use or benefit.  Nolen attacked this finding by arguing that he didn't know the information was secret.  The simple answer to Nolen's argument is that the jury was not required to believe him and did not.


24
c) Nolen wrongfully disclosed Molex's trade secrets or confidential information to others.  Nolen shared his information about Tandy with his employees at Western.


25
d) Nolen's misappropriation and use of Molex's trade secrets or confidential information was the proximate cause of loss to Molex and benefit to Nolen.  Molex lost Tandy as a customer, and Nolen gained Tandy as a customer.


26
e) Nolen had a fiduciary relationship with Molex.  Under Texas law, "[t]he term includes those informal relations which exist whenever one party trusts and relies upon another."   Kinzbach Tool Co., Inc. v. Corbett-Wallace Corp., 138 Tex. 565, 160 S.W.2d 509, 512-13 (1942).  The Texas Supreme Court held a salesman to have a fiduciary relationship with his employer in Kinzbach.    Molex obviously trusted and relied on Nolen, as the sales representative responsible for the Tandy account, in its dealings with Tandy.


27
f) Nolen breached his fiduciary duty to Molex.  On this record, it would have been astounding had the jury found otherwise.


28
g) Nolen's breach of his fiduciary duty to Molex during the term of his employment with Molex was the proximate cause of loss or damage to Molex, or benefit or value to Nolen.  Again, this proposition is too obvious to require discussion.


29
h) The sum of $112,500 would reasonably compensate Molex for its loss or for Nolen's profits.  The trial court correctly instructed the jury that it could award damages to Molex on the "reasonable royalty" theory.   See Universal Computing Co. v. Lykes-Youngstown Corp., 504 F.2d 518, 536-39 (5th Cir.1974);  Sikes v. McGraw Edison Co., 665 F.2d 731, 737 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 458 U.S. 1108, 102 S.Ct. 3488, 73 L.Ed.2d 1369 (1982).  Nolen's total sales were $1.5 million;  the jury awarded Molex 7 1/2 percent of that amount, or $112,500.  This award was consistent with expert testimony presented by Molex;  it was also approximately equal to the total amount actually received by Nolen from Molex and Western during the relevant period.  There was thus ample evidence to support the award.


30
i) Nolen's actions were maliciously or wantonly or oppressively done.  Nolen's assertion that he acted in good faith merits no discussion.


31
j) Molex should be awarded $250,000 as exemplary damages for Nolen's actions.  In Russell v. Truitt, 554 S.W.2d 948 (Tex.Civ.App.--Ft. Worth 1977, writ ref'd n.r.e.), an action for breach of fiduciary duty, the court affirmed exemplary damages of $55,000, nearly seven times the actual damages of $8,000.  In so doing, the court stated,The question of excessiveness of exemplary damages depends on the facts of the particular case and is largely within the discretion of the jury.  Among the factors to be considered are "the nature of the wrong, the character of the conduct involved, the degree of culpability of the wrongdoer, the situation and sensibilities of the parties concerned, and the extent to which such conduct offends a public sense of justice and propriety."   Cain v. Fontana, 423 S.W.2d 134, 139 (Tex.Civ.App.--San Antonio 1967, writ ref'd n.r.e.);   Schutz v. Morris, 201 S.W.2d 144, 147 (Tex.Civ.App.--Austin 1947, no writ).


32
554 S.W.2d at 955.  The award in this case, twice the actual damages, is certainly not so large as to "indicate that it is a result of passion, prejudice or corruption, or that evidence has been disregarded."   Crutcher-Rolfs-Cummings, Inc. v. Ballard, 540 S.W.2d 380, 389 (Tex.Civ.App.--Corpus Christi 1976, writ ref'd n.r.e.), cert. denied, 433 U.S. 910, 97 S.Ct. 2978, 53 L.Ed.2d 1095 (1977).  It is affirmed.

Conclusion

The judgment of the trial court is modified in the respect noted at page 5 and, as modified, is

AFFIRMED.

87 F.3d 676
UNITED STATES of America, Plaintiff-Appellee,v.Roland C. REYES, Defendant-Appellant.
No. 95-50637.
United States Court of Appeals,Fifth Circuit.
June 26, 1996.

Richard L. Durbin, Jr., Asst. U.S. Attorney, Office of the United States Attorney, San Antonio, TX, for Plaintiff-Appellee.
Philip J. Lynch, Office of the Federal Public Defender, San Antonio, TX, for Defendant-Appellant.
Appeal from the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas.
Before GARWOOD, HIGGINBOTHAM and BENAVIDES, Circuit Judges.
GARWOOD, Circuit Judge:


1
Defendant-appellant Roland C. Reyes (Reyes) appeals the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment charging him with operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated at Kelly Air Force Base (Kelly AFB) in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 13, incorporating section 49.04 of the Texas Penal Code.

Facts and Proceedings Below

2
Reyes is charged with driving while intoxicated at Kelly AFB, on or about January 31, 1994.   Reyes, a civilian employee of the Department of the Air Force who works at Kelly AFB, argues that his prosecution is barred by principles of double jeopardy because he has already been "punished" by a three-day, unpaid suspension from work pursuant to Department of the Air Force regulations and 5 U.S.C. §§ 7501-7543.1  The magistrate judge denied the motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the suspension did not constitute punishment under the Double Jeopardy Clause, precluding any punishment imposed by the criminal proceeding from being a second punishment for double jeopardy purposes.   The district court denied Reyes' appeal of the denial of his motion to dismiss.   Reyes now appeals to this Court.

Discussion

3
This Court has jurisdiction over an interlocutory appeal from a refusal to dismiss an indictment on grounds of double jeopardy.  United States v. Perez, 70 F.3d 345, 346-47 (5th Cir.1995).   The Double Jeopardy Clause states:  "nor shall any person be subject to the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb."   U.S. CONST.AMEND. V.   It provides protection from both multiple prosecutions and multiple punishments for the same offense.  Id. at 348.   Only the protection from multiple punishments is before us in the instant case.


4
The Supreme Court has held that certain civil sanctions may constitute "punishment" under the Double Jeopardy Clause and trigger its protection.  United States v. Halper, 490 U.S. 435, 446-48, 109 S.Ct. 1892, 1901, 104 L.Ed.2d 487 (1989).   Whether such a civil sanction is punishment within the meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause may depend upon the purposes of the civil sanction.   E.g., id.   In Halper, the Court held that if either retribution or deterrence is a purpose of such a civil sanction, then it is punishment.  Halper, 490 U.S. at 446-50, 109 S.Ct. at 1901-02.2  We refer to this purpose-oriented test as the Halper punishment test.   Reyes argues that the imposition of a criminal punishment for his drunk driving would be a second punishment prohibited by the Due Process Clause pursuant to the Halper punishment test because his suspension from work was for deterrent or retributive purposes, not for any remedial purpose.   The government does not essentially dispute that the suspension was imposed, at least in part, for purposes of deterrence, to deter Reyes, or other employees at the base, from similar on-base conduct.3


5
The fact that the government suspended Reyes at least partially for a deterrent purpose does not end our inquiry.   The question facing us, which is one of first impression in this Circuit, is whether literal application of the Halper punishment test is appropriate in the context of government-imposed employee discipline of a type which an ordinary private employer generally could lawfully impose without invoking the machinery of the sovereign.4  In other words, does this kind of government-imposed employee discipline constitute punishment for double jeopardy purposes if its goal is employee deterrence?   We could answer negatively for two possible reasons, either (1) even if the suspension was imposed for a deterrent, and hence under Halper a punitive, purpose, such employee discipline does not constitute punishment for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause;  or (2) Halper 's method of defining punishment is unworkable in the context of this sort of employee discipline.5  Because we hold that this character of employee discipline, even where it has a deterrent purpose, is not punishment under the Double Jeopardy Clause, we need not determine whether the Halper method for defining punishment would be appropriate in this context.


6
The Double Jeopardy Clause is a "restraint on governmental power."  United States v. Sanchez-Escareno, 950 F.2d 193, 197 (5th Cir.1991), cert. denied 506 U.S. 841, 113 S.Ct. 123, 121 L.Ed.2d 78 (1992).  "In order for the Double Jeopardy Clause to have any application, there must be actions by a sovereign, which place an individual twice in jeopardy.   The Double Jeopardy Clause does not apply to actions involving private individuals."  United States v. Beszborn, 21 F.3d 62, 67-68 (5th Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 330, 130 L.Ed.2d 288 (1994).   Thus, we have applied the Halper punishment test to civil sanctions imposed by the government when acting in its capacity as sovereign.   E.g., Perez, 70 F.3d at 348 (property forfeiture);  United States v. Tilley, 18 F.3d 295, 298-301 (5th Cir.1994) (forfeiture of illegal drug proceeds), cert. denied --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 574, 130 L.Ed.2d 490 (1994);  Woods, 949 F.2d at 176 (placing an entity in receivership);  see also Sanchez-Escareno, 950 F.2d at 200 (noting that Halper punishment test would apply to civil fines).   And we have declined to apply the Halper punishment test to civil sanctions imposed by a governmental entity, the Resolution Trust Corporation, acting in its "unique non-governmental role" as receiver of failed financial institution-instead of in its role as sovereign.  Beszborn, 21 F.3d at 68 (holding Double Jeopardy Clause inapplicable);  see also United States v. Heffner, 85 F.3d 435, 438-39 (9th Cir.1996) (adopting Beszborn reasoning).   Thus, if the government was acting in a role other than as sovereign in its suspension of Reyes, and was doing no more than a typical private employer generally could lawfully do without invoking the machinery of the sovereign, we will not apply the Halper test because the Double Jeopardy Clause is inapplicable.


7
There is ample support for constitutionally distinguishing government acting as employer from government acting as sovereign.   This Court has noted that "[t]he role of the Government as an employer toward its employees is fundamentally different from its role as sovereign over private citizens generally."  Bush v. Lucas, 647 F.2d 573, 576 (5th Cir.1981), aff'd by 462 U.S. 367, 103 S.Ct. 2404, 76 L.Ed.2d 648 (1983).   The Supreme Court has differentiated between governmental actions taken as sovereign and as employer.   In Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 146-48, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 1690, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983), for example, the Court made it clear that the First Amendment did not protect governmental employees from even unreasonable adverse employment actions based on speech unrelated to a public concern.   Although the government acting in its role as sovereign may not punish a private citizen for speech it dislikes, the government acting as employer may punish its employees for the same speech if it is not of public concern.   See id.   Similarly, governmental searches and seizures are held to a less stringent standard under the Fourth Amendment when conducted in the government's role as employer than when made in its role as sovereign.   See O'Connor v. Ortega, 480 U.S. 709, 721-27, 107 S.Ct. 1492, 1500-02, 94 L.Ed.2d 714 (1987) (plurality opinion) (rejecting the requirement of probable cause, which is necessary for searches as sovereign, and applying a reasonableness standard to governmental employer's search);  see also National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab, 489 U.S. 656, 669-72, 109 S.Ct. 1384, 1393-94, 103 L.Ed.2d 685 (1989) (noting that certain forms of public employment diminish expectations of privacy and subject governmental employees to routine personal searches).


8
We recognize that the government even in its capacity as employer is nevertheless subject to certain constitutional restrictions that are inapplicable to the private employer.   For example, the governmental employer is constitutionally prohibited from discriminating on grounds of race.   Likewise, the governmental employer is subject to certain constitutional due process restrictions in terminating employees having a property interest in their positions, restrictions that are not constitutionally imposed on the private employer.   See Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985).   There are, of course, other examples.   See, e.g., Von Raab; Ortega.   These restrictions, however, protect the governmental employee from certain adverse employment actions by his employer, they do not involve any characterization of such adverse actions as "punishment."   If these restrictions are transgressed, the employee's remedy is to have the adverse action set aside, or to assert a cause of action under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), it is not to preclude subsequent criminal prosecution for the same conduct.6  The interests these restrictions protect are not the same as or even remotely analogous to the interests that the Double Jeopardy Clause protects.   We conclude that these constitutional restrictions on governmental action in its capacity as an employer are not a persuasive basis on which to hold that "punishment" for Double Jeopardy Clause purposes embraces adverse employment action taken by the government in its capacity as employer, rather than as sovereign, particularly where, as here, the action is of a kind a typical private employer generally could lawfully take without invoking the machinery of the sovereign.   To construe the Double Jeopardy Clause to include this sort of employee discipline as "punishment" would confer on governmental employees rights against subsequent criminal prosecution--certainly the central thrust of the Double Jeopardy Clause--that private employees do not have.   Such unequal protection from criminal prosecution is inconsistent with all our traditions.


9
We also note that the Framers' intent does not support reading the Double Jeopardy Clause to prohibit a criminal prosecution because such employee discipline has been meted out by a governmental employer.   Courts may look to the common law to determine what the Double Jeopardy Clause means by "punishment."   See Ex parte Lange, 85 U.S.  (18 Wall.) 163, 170, 21 L.Ed. 872 (1873) (noting that salutary principles of common law have been embodied in the Constitution);  United States v. Jenkins, 490 F.2d 868, 873 (2d Cir.1973) (Framers intended Double Jeopardy Clause to import common law protections into Constitution), aff'd, 420 U.S. 358, 95 S.Ct. 1006, 43 L.Ed.2d 250 (1975).   Colonial lawyers, including the Framers, widely relied on treatises by Sir Edward Coke and Sir William Blackstone for their understanding of English common law.   Jay A. Sigler, Double Jeopardy:  The Development of a Legal and Social Policy 16 (1969).   According to Coke, the double jeopardy doctrine was "clearly delineated as a purely criminal concept serving as a protection against the state...."  Id. at 19.   Similarly, Blackstone interpreted the double jeopardy protection to apply only to felonies.   See id. at 20.   It seems evident that neither Coke nor Blackstone envisioned employee discipline as falling under the protection of double jeopardy.   Furthermore, the discussions in the House regarding the wording of the Double Jeopardy Clause only considered actions by the government as sovereign.   Id. at 30 (citing 1 Annals of Cong. 753).   And the Senate initially adopted a clause applying only to "public prosecution."   Id. at 31.   Though the "public prosecution" language was dropped, neither the common law nor the legislative debates lead us to believe that the Framers conceived of governmental employee discipline as falling within the scope of the clause.


10
Reyes conceded at oral argument that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not apply to governmental employee discipline that is imposed for work-related misconduct.   He argues, however, that governmental employer sanctions imposed for non-work-related conduct do trigger double jeopardy protections.   Even if we interpret this argument as one that the government acts as sovereign (instead of as an employer) when it sanctions its employees for off-duty behavior, Reyes' constitutional claim still must fail.


11
The government was not able to suspend Reyes because it is sovereign;  it was able to, and actually did, suspend him because it is his employer.   The government acts as sovereign when it uses powers over which it has a monopoly.   Generally speaking, any private employer could have suspended him for the same conduct and could have done so without invoking the machinery of the sovereign.   See Oil Chem. and Atomic Workers Int'l Union, Local No. 4-228 v. Union Oil Co., 818 F.2d 437, 441 (5th Cir.1987) (rejecting argument that discharge of private employee for off-duty/off-premises illegal drug sales is an impermissible extension of employer's power over its employees);  see also Bonet v. United States Postal Serv., 712 F.2d 213 (5th Cir.1983) (upholding discharge of postal worker based on charges of sexually indecent conduct with his minor stepdaughters).   In temporarily suspending Reyes from its employment, the government acted in its capacity as his employer and exercised power that a private person (i.e. non-sovereign) could have used.   For this reason, we reject Reyes' invitation to hold that a governmental employer's suspension from its employment without pay of one of its employees constitutes punishment under the Double Jeopardy Clause if that action is taken on account of the employee's non-work-related conduct.7Conclusion


12
For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the denial of motion to dismiss the indictment and REMAND to the district court for trial on the merits.8



1
 Reyes' privilege to drive on the base was also revoked for three days.   This was not asserted as a basis for his motion to dismiss before the magistrate judge or the district court


2
 Halper states "a civil sanction that cannot fairly be said solely to serve a remedial purpose, but rather can only be explained as also serving either retributive or deterrent purposes, is punishment...."  Halper, 490 U.S. at 448, 109 S.Ct. at 1902 (emphasis added).   The Halper opinion then precedes to restate its holding, characterizing punishment as a sanction that "may not fairly be characterized as remedial, but only as a deterrent or retribution."  Id. (emphasis added).   The varying placement and inclusion of solely and only in these two statements is somewhat confusing.   We recognize that Justice O'Connor reads Halper in accordance with the second iteration of the punishment test, which may be described as a "punitive purposes only" test.   See Department of Revenue of Montana v. Kurth Ranch, --- U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 1937, 1953, 128 L.Ed.2d 767 (1994) (O'Connor, J. dissenting).   This Court, however, has relied on the first Halper statement of the test, characterizing the standard for determining whether a sanction is punishment as "whether the civil sanction serves solely a remedial purpose, or also a retributive or deterrent purpose."  Perez, 70 F.3d at 348 (emphasis added)


3
 The government argues that the suspension was to promote the efficiency of the service, but the only efficiency the government identifies was to be gained by deterring Reyes (and possibly others) from driving while intoxicated on Kelly AFB


4
 This Circuit has applied the Halper punishment test outside the context of civil fines.   See, e.g., United States v. Woods, 949 F.2d 175 (5th Cir.1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 961, 112 S.Ct. 1562, 118 L.Ed.2d 210 (1992).   In Woods, the defendant-appellant argued that he was previously "punished" by the placement of his savings and loan association (S & L) in receivership.  Woods, 949 F.2d at 176-77.   This Court held that the S & L was placed in receivership to protect the United States Treasury from avoidable insurance losses by assuring proper bank management.  Id. at 177.   Because there was no retributive or deterrent purpose, there was no punishment.  Id.;  see also Bae v. Shalala, 44 F.3d 489, 493-95 (7th Cir.1995) (applying Halper punishment test to debarment from pharmaceutical industry);  United States v. Hudson, 14 F.3d 536, 540 (10th Cir.1994) (applying Halper punishment test to debarment from banking industry);  United States v. Newby, 11 F.3d 1143, 1144-45 (3d Cir.1993) (purporting to apply Halper in prison disciplinary context), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 111, 130 L.Ed.2d 58 (1994)
At least four circuits have refused to extend the Halper punishment test to certain other contexts.   See United States v. Stoller, 78 F.3d 710, 717 (1st Cir.1996) (applying totality of circumstances test--instead of Halper test--to indefinite bar on having any association with the banking industry);  United States v. Hernandez-Fundora, 58 F.3d 802, 806 (2d Cir.1995) (refusing to apply Halper punishment test to the prison disciplinary context), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 2288, 132 L.Ed.2d 290 (1995);  Garrity v. Fiedler, 41 F.3d 1150, 1152-53 (7th Cir.1994) (same), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1420, 131 L.Ed.2d 303 (1995);  Manocchio v. Kusserow, 961 F.2d 1539, 1541-42 (11th Cir.1992) (holding that Halper analysis not applicable to administrative order barring doctor from participating in federal Medicare program and applying a totality of the circumstances test to find that the purpose of the exclusion was to protect the public).
We have cited Hernandez-Fundora, Garrity, and Newby with approval in holding that a prison disciplinary proceeding resulting in loss of good time credits and transfer to a higher security facility does not constitute a double jeopardy bar to subsequent prosecution for the same conduct, but without expressly stating that this conclusion followed from an application of Halper or a determination that the Halper test was inapplicable.  United States v. Galan, 82 F.3d 639 (5th Cir.1996).   See also United States v. Brown, 59 F.3d 102, 103-05 (9th Cir.1995).


5
 See, e.g., Kurth Ranch, --- U.S. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 1948 (unworkable in tax context);  see also Bennis v. Michigan, --- U.S. ----, ----, 116 S.Ct. 994, 1000, 134 L.Ed.2d 68 (1996) (noting that civil forfeiture serves a deterrent purpose "distinct from any punitive purpose").   Two circuits have held that specific government-imposed employee discipline failed to trigger double jeopardy protection.   See United States v. Payne, 2 F.3d 706 (6th Cir.1993);  United States v. Reed, 937 F.2d 575 (11th Cir.1991).   The Reed Court distinguished Halper by noting that it is the rule for a rare case, and Payne relied exclusively on Reed.  Payne, 2 F.3d at 710-11;  Reed, 937 F.2d at 577.   The defendant-appellants in both Reed and Payne were postal employees who were disciplined for on-the-job misfeasance.  Payne, 2 F.3d at 707-08;  Reed, 937 F.2d at 575-76.   The Reed Court held that the employee's suspension served the "legitimate nonpunitive governmental objective[ ]" of vindicating the government's contract rights under the collective bargaining agreement.  Reed, 937 F.2d at 578.   It then went on to note that allowing employee disciplinary actions to constitute punishment under the Double Jeopardy Clause could lead to the "absurd result" of law-breaking employees forum-shopping (i.e. trying to get disciplined as an employee to avoid criminal prosecution).  Id
The implicit holding behind the explicit one in Reed is that governmental employer discipline is not necessarily punitive even if the discipline itself is intended to deter employee behavior.   Once this is recognized, it is clear that Reed is no longer following the Halper method of defining punitive.   See id. at 577-78 (failing to mention punitive goal of deterrence).   Thus, we read these cases as authority for refusing to employ the Halper method for defining punitive to include all deterrent-based employee discipline.


6
 Reyes never contested or challenged his suspension.   Cf. United States v. Schinnell, 80 F.3d 1064 (5th Cir.1996)


7
 This is one of those instances where, despite the absence of a relatively recent "spotted horse" case, our judicial intuition--or common sense--tells us that the result is foreordained.   Often in such situations it is preferable to simply announce the conclusion, rather than to attempt to explicate its doctrinal basis.   Sometimes, however, the latter exercise serves as useful check on potentially erroneous or simply reflexive intuition, particularly where some of the contextual principles appear to be in at least moderate flux.   With these considerations in mind, we have written at some length on what others might consider to be a question with an obvious and simple answer

 After the foregoing opinion was prepared and circulated, the Supreme Court handed down its opinion in the consolidated cases of United States v. Ursery and United States v. $405,089.23 In United States Currency, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 2134, --- L.Ed.2d ---- (1996), holding that certain contested "in rem civil forfeitures" under 21 U.S.C. § 881(a)(6) & (7) and 18 U.S.C. § 981(a)(1)(A) were "neither 'punishment' [of the contesting owner of the forfeited items] nor criminal for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause."   The Ursery opinion is not directly on point, as it gives heavy emphasis to the in rem nature of the forfeitures there at issue, and distinguishes Halper and Kurth Ranch largely because those cases involved in personam proceedings.   Nevertheless, Ursery certainly cautions against an expansive reading of the Double Jeopardy Clause and reinforces our conclusion that it is not implicated here.   For example, Ursery cites with approval the passage in Gore v. United States, 357 U.S. 386, 391-93, 78 S.Ct. 1280, 1284, 2 L.Ed.2d 1405 (1958), which includes the reference to "double jeopardy" as a provision "which is rooted in history and is not an evolving concept."  Ursery at * 8, at ----, 116 S.Ct. at ----.  Also, Ursery refers to the line of cases exemplified by Halper as involving "potentially punitive in personam civil penalties such as fines," id. at * 8, at ----, 116 S.Ct. at ----, a description wholly consistent with the idea that a necessary, albeit not always sufficient, attribute of "punishment" for double jeopardy purposes is that it have been exacted by the government in the exercise of its sovereign coercive powers.   Finally, we observe that Ursery plainly indicates that merely because a sanction may have a deterrent purpose does not necessarily mean that it is a punishment for double jeopardy purposes, particularly where it "has not historically been regarded as punishment," id. at * 16, at ----, 116 S.Ct. at ----, as is certainly the case with the employee suspension here

MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
FISH, Chief Judge.
Before the court are (1) the motion of the defendant Indianapolis Life Insurance Company ("Indianapolis Life") to dismiss one claim against it; (2) the motion of the defendant xélan,[1] the Economic Association of Health Professionals ("Xelan") to dismiss, or in the alternative, to abate the action against it; and (3) the motion of the defendant Benjamin Daniel Kennedy, III ("Kennedy") to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state claims upon which relief can be granted. For the reasons stated below, the motions are denied.

I. BACKGROUND

This suit arises from the attempted creation of a tax shelter through the purchase of multiple insurance policies. Charles D. Kennard is a physician residing in Texas, Original Complaint ¶ 5, who organized a professional association known as Charles D. Kennard, M.D., P.A. Id. ¶ 6. This professional association established a defined benefit plan ("Charles D. Kennard, M.D., P.A. Defined Benefit Plan" or "Kennard DBP") to provide retirement benefits for its employees and their beneficiaries.[2]Id. ¶ 7.
According to the complaint, Kennedy and Xelan, acting as agents for Indianapolis Life, approached Kennard and suggested establishing the Kennard DBP. Original Complaint ¶ 16. Wholly funded by life insurance policies, the Kennard DBP was represented as being in compliance with Section 412(i) of the Internal Revenue Code and would provide significant tax deductions. Id. ¶¶ 16, 18. Kennard purchased these policies from Indianapolis Life and subsequently paid more than $300,000 in premiums. Id. ¶¶19-20.
In 2004, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") determined that the issuance of policies similar to Kennard's constitutes a "listed transaction" and would not qualify as a Section 412(i) plan. Original Complaint ¶ 23. In addition, the IRS found that certain transactions involving these policies were not allowable as tax deductions. Id. Beyond these issues, Kennard *605 discovered several other defects associated with the policies. See id. ¶¶ 24-26 (the policy jeopardizes the Kennard DBP's status as a Section 412(i) plan, the policy is subject to an "excessive surrender charge," and it has not been approved by the Texas Department of Insurance).
On June 17, 2005, Kennard filed this suit, alleging three causes of action: rescission of the non-approved insurance policy; violations of Article 21.21 of the Texas Insurance Code; and violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act ("DTPA"). Docket Sheet; Original Complaint. On August 22, 2005, Indianapolis Life and Xelan filed these motions to dismiss, followed approximately a month later by Kennedy's motion. Docket Sheet.

II. ANALYSIS


A. Kennedy's Motion to Dismiss or Abate

Kennedy moves for dismissal under both 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). Under Rule 12(b)(1), Kennedy argues that this court has no subject matter jurisdiction over this dispute because there is neither a ripe claim, nor federal question or diversity jurisdiction. Defendant Benjamin Daniel Kennedy, III's Combined Original Motion to Dismiss Claims for Lack of Subject-Matter Jurisdiction and Failure to State Claims Upon Which Relief Can be Granted and, Alternatively, to Abate, and Brief in Support Thereof ("Kennedy Motion") at 1. Under Rule 12(b)(6), Kennedy argues that the claims against him should be dismissed for failure to meet the Rule 9(b) requirements of pleading fraud with particularity. Id. Finally, Kennedy argues that this action should be abated because he did not receive pre-suit notice in accordance with DTPA requirements. Id. Kennard disputes all assertions by Kennedy. See generally Plaintiffs' Response to Defendant Kennedy's Motion to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, to Abate and Brief in Support Thereof ("Kennard's Kennedy Response"). The court will address each of these contentions in turn.

1. Subject Matter Jurisdiction


a. Standard for Rule 12(b)(1) Motion to Dismiss

Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes the dismissal of a case for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter. See FED. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). A motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be considered by the court before any other challenge because "the court must find jurisdiction before determining the validity of a claim." Moran v. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 27 F.3d 169, 172 (5th Cir.1994) (internal citation omitted); see also Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Company, 526 U.S. 574, 577, 119 S.Ct. 1563, 143 L.Ed.2d 760 (1999) ("The requirement that jurisdiction be established as a threshold matter . . . is inflexible and without exception") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). On a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, which "concerns the court's `very power to hear the case . . . [,] the trial court is free to weigh the evidence and satisfy itself as to the existence of its power to hear the case.'" MDPhysicians & Associates, Inc. v. State Board of Insurance, 957 F.2d 178, 181 (5th Cir.) (quoting Williamson v. Tucker, 645 F.2d 404, 413 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 897, 102 S.Ct. 396, 70 L.Ed.2d 212 (1981)), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 861, 113 S.Ct. 179, 121 L.Ed.2d 125 (1992). In ruling on a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1), the court may rely on: "1) the complaint alone; 2) the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts; or 3) the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts and the court's resolution of disputed facts." MCG, Inc. v. Great Western Energy Corporation,, 896 F.2d *606 170, 176 (5th Cir.1990) (citing Williamson, 645 F.2d at 413).
The standard for reviewing a motion under Rule 12(b)(1), however, depends on whether the defendant makes a facial or factual attack on the plaintiffs' complaint. Paterson v. Weinberger, 644 F.2d 521, 523 (5th Cir.1981). The defendant makes a facial attack by the mere filing of a Rule 12(b)(1) motion. Id. In that case, the trial court must look at the sufficiency of the allegations in the complaint, which are presumed to be true. Id. The defendant makes a factual attack, on the other hand, by providing affidavits, testimony, or other evidentiary materials challenging the jurisdiction of the court. Id. In a factual attack, the plaintiffs are also required to submit facts in support of jurisdiction and have the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the trial court has subject matter jurisdiction over the claims. Middle South Energy, Inc. v. City of New Orleans, 800 F.2d 488, 490 (5th Cir.1986).
In the instant motion, Kennedy has presented the court with a facial attack on the standing of each plaintiff, asserting (without evidentiary support) that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this dispute because the case is not ripe for resolution and there is neither federal question nor diversity jurisdiction. Kennedy Motion at 1. For the reasons discussed below, the court concludes that the instant dispute is ripe and diversity jurisdiction is present.

b. Ripeness

In his motion to dismiss, Kennedy argues that Kennard's claims are not yet ripe because Kennard's "legal basis for actual damagesdisqualification of the [Kennard DBP]is admittedly potential and unrealized." Kennedy Motion at 5. Because Kennard is currently undergoing an audit by the IRS, Kennard's Kennedy Response at 2, which has yet to disqualify the Kennard DBP, Kennedy argues that there is no ripe case or controversy. Id. Ripenessthe fact that a case is neither "premature [n]or speculative""is a constitutional prerequisite to the exercise of jurisdiction." Shields v. Norton, 289 F.3d 832, 835 (5th Cir.) (citing United Transportation Union v. Foster, 205 F.3d 851, 857 (5th Cir.2000), and Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148-49, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967)), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1071, 123 S.Ct. 663, 154 L.Ed.2d 565 (2002). As explained below, the fact that the IRS has yet to rule on the Kennard DBP's validity for tax deduction purposes is irrelevant; Kennard has already suffered damages and continues to incur expenses, most notably while defending his audit. See Affidavit of E. Philip Bush ¶¶ 4-5, attached to Kennard's Kennedy Response as Exhibit A ("Bush Affidavit") (noting that "Dr. Kennard became the subject of [an] IRS audit as a result of his reliance on advice and representations by Benjamin Daniel Kennedy, III, and others" and has subsequently incurred expenses of $40,880 as a result of this audit).[3] These injuries are already immediate and definite, so the fact that the other damages from the IRS audit remain contingent at *607 this time do not make this dispute premature or speculative. See Seippel v. Jenkens & Gilchrist, P.C., 341 F.Supp.2d 363, 371 (S.D.N.Y.2004) (finding that the damages allegedfees paid to defendants, losses incurred in tax shelter transactions, expenses paid to defend audit, losses from forced sale of assets, and tax penalties were sufficient to satisfy ripeness requirement). Accordingly, the court finds this case to be ripe for judicial resolution.

c. Diversity Jurisdiction

A party attempting to invoke federal court jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing that jurisdiction. Langley v. Jackson State University, 14 F.3d 1070, 1073 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 811, 115 S.Ct. 61, 130 L.Ed.2d 19 (1994). A district court has subject matter jurisdiction over an action on the grounds of diversity of citizenship when no plaintiff is a citizen of the same state as a defendant and when the amount in controversy exceeds the sum of $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs. 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a). Here, citizenship is not contested; instead, Kennedy argues that Kennard has failed to allege an amount in controversy sufficient to confer diversity jurisdiction. Kennedy Motion at 8.
The sum claimed by a plaintiff controls the court's "amount in controversy" analysis, unless it appears to a legal certainty that the claim is really for less than the jurisdictional amount. See, e.g., St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co., 303 U.S. 283, 288, 58 S.Ct. 586, 82 L.Ed. 845 (1938); see also St. Paul Reinsurance Company, Ltd. v. Greenberg, 134 F.3d 1250, 1253 (5th Cir.1998); Allen v. R & H Oil & Gas Company, 63 F.3d 1326, 1335 (5th Cir.1995). In general, the court will look to the plaintiffs complaint regarding the pleaded amount in controversy, but the court is also free to look to other information before the court, including any discovery material and affidavits. See Diefenthal v. Civil Aeronautics Board, 681 F.2d 1039, 1053 (5th Cir.1982) ("the party invoking the court's jurisdiction has the burden of establishing the factual basis of his claim by pleading or affidavit") (emphasis added), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1107, 103 S.Ct. 732, 74 L.Ed.2d 956 (1983); 14B WRIGHT & MILLER § 3702 (3d ed.1998) at 57-59 ("Typically the district court will rely upon the pleadings, but there often is other information before the court, such as discovery material and any affidavits. . . ."); Cleveland Construction, Inc. v. Centex Construction Company, Inc., No. 3:03-CV-1437-N, 2004 WL 594093, at *2 (N.D.Tex. Mar. 24, 2004) ("the Court may consider `summary judgment type evidence' to determine whether the amount in controversy is sufficient for the Court to exercise diversity jurisdiction") (quoting Hartford Insurance Group v. Lou-Con Inc., 293 F.3d 908, 910 (5th Cir.2002)).
Here, Kennard has asserted damages "totaling at least $500,000," Original Complaint ¶¶ 37, 45, against all defendants, including Kennedy. Since "the sum claimed by the plaintiff controls if the claim is apparently made in good faith," St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co., 303 U.S. at 288, 58 S.Ct. 586, Kennard has satisfactorily alleged an amount in controversy sufficient to confer jurisdiction over this dispute. To further bolster this conclusion, as mentioned above, Kennard has already incurred over $40,000 solely in professional expenses to defend an IRS audit and "will incur substantial additional fees and expenses" as the audit continues. Bush Affidavit ¶ 5. This amount is independent of any damages Kennard claims as part of his suit against all defendants which, according to the complaint, could be treble the *608 amount of any actual damages suffered.[4] Original Complaint ¶¶ 20 (stating that Kennard has already spent more than $300,000 on premiums for the insurance policies from defendants), 38 & 46 (noting that, "because Defendants acted knowingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to recover treble damages"). Because diversity jurisdiction exists over this dispute, Kennedy's motion to dismiss on this ground is denied.[5]

2. Failure to Plead Fraud Claim with Requisite Particularity

As mentioned above, Kennedy also argues that Kennard's complaint should be dismissed for failure to meet the heightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b), which govern claims of fraud. Kennedy Motion at 9. For the reasons stated below, the court disagrees.

a. Standard for Dismissal Under Rule 12(b)(6)

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) authorizes dismissal of a complaint for "failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted." FED. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). There are two primary principles that guide the court's determination of whether dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) should be granted. First, a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) should be granted only if it appears beyond doubt that the nonmovants could prove no set of facts in support of their claims that would entitle them to relief, Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957); Leffall v. Dallas Independent School District, 28 F.3d 521, 524 (5th Cir.1994); see also Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Sales, Inc. v. Avondale Shipyards, Inc., 677 F.2d 1045, 1050 (5th Cir.1982) (citing WRIGHT & MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE: CIVIL § 1357 at 598 (1969), for the proposition that "the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is viewed with disfavor and is rarely granted"), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1105, 103 S.Ct. 729, 74 L.Ed.2d 953 (1983). Second, the court must accept all well-pleaded facts as true and view them in the light most favorable to the nonmovants. Capital Parks, Inc. v. Southeastern Advertising and Sales System, Inc., 30 F.3d 627, 629 (5th Cir.1994); Norman v. Apache Corporation, 19 F.3d 1017, 1021 (5th Cir. 1994); Chrissy F. by Medley v. Mississippi Department of Public Welfare, 925 F.2d 844, 846 (5th Cir.1991). However, conclusory allegations and unwarranted factual deductions will not suffice to prevent a motion to dismiss. United States ex rel. Willard v. Humana Health Plan of Texas Inc., 336 F.3d 375, 379 (5th Cir.2003).
If it appears that a more carefully drafted pleading might state a claim upon which relief could be granted, the court should give the claimant an opportunity to amend his claim rather than dismiss it. *609 Friedlander v. Nims, 755 F.2d 810, 813 (11th Cir.1985); Taylor v. Dallas County Hospital District, 976 F.Supp. 437, 438 (N.D.Tex.1996). Furthermore, leave to amend a pleading should be freely given and should be granted unless there is some justification for refusal. Willard, 336 F.3d at 386.

b. DTPA and Texas Insurance Code Claims

Kennard has alleged claims under both the DTPA and Texas Insurance Code. See Original Complaint ¶¶ 31-46. Kennedy argues that these claims must be pleaded with requisite particularity to fulfill the standards of Rule 9(b), Kennedy Motion at 9, while Kennard argues that he must only satisfy Rule 8(a) pleading requirements. Kennard's Kennedy Response at 10-11. The court agrees with Kennard on this issue. Although stated in the context of a claim for negligence misrepresentation, the Fifth Circuit has declared that "Rule 9(b)'s stringent pleading requirements should not be extended to causes of action not enumerated therein," American Realty Trust, Inc. v. Hamilton Lane Advisors, Inc., 115 Fed.Appx. 662, 668 (5th Cir.2004). When both fraud and non-fraud claims are alleged, Rule 9(b) pleading requirements sometimes apply to both, but compliance with Rule 9(b) is required only when the non-fraud claims are "so intertwined" with the fraud averments that it is not possible to describe a simple redaction to separate the two. See Afshar v. Norwood, No. 3:05-CV-1625-G, 2005 LEXIS 33113, at *10 (N.D.Tex. Dec. 14, 2005) (Fish, C.J.) (citing Nazareth International, Inc. v. J.C. Penney Corporation, Inc., No. 3:04-CV-1265-M, 2005 WL 1704793, at *3-4 (N.D. Tex. July 19, 2005) (Lynn, J.) (discussing evolution of pleading requirements for negligent misrepresentation after Benchmark Electronics, Inc. v. J.M. Huber Corporation, 343 F.3d 719 (5th Cir.2003), and American Realty, 115 Fed. Appx. 662)). Here, Kennard enumerates three causes of action, none of which is fraud eo nomine. See Original Complaint ¶¶ 27-46. With no allegations "intertwined" with those of fraud, the court finds that Rule 9(b) should not be applied to Kennard's claims under the DTPA and Texas Insurance Code. See, e.g., Infomart (India), Pvt., Ltd. v. Metrowerks Corporation, No. 3:04-CV-1299-N, 2005 WL 292433, at *7 (N.D.Tex. Feb. 7, 2005) (Godbey, J.) (holding that since the court could disentangle the inadequately pleaded fraud claims from the plaintiff's DTPA causes of action, the defendant was not entitled to dismissal of the plaintiffs DTPA claims for failure to meet Rule 9(b) pleading requirements). Accordingly, Kennedy's motion to dismiss on this ground is denied.

3. Lack of Pre-Suit DTPA Notice

Finally, Kennedy moves in the alternative to abate this action pending receipt of pre-suit DTPA notice. Kennedy Motion at 14. To discourage litigation and encourage settlement, a plaintiff claiming damages under the DTPA or the Texas Insurance Code is required to give 60 days notice of the forthcoming suit. Hines v. Hash, 843 S.W.2d 464, 468-69 (Tex.1992). If the court discovers that the plaintiff has not complied with this notice requirement, it must abate the proceedings for 60 days. Id. This requirement is waived, though, when an impending statute of limitations makes notice impracticable. TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE § 17.505(b); TEX. INS.CODE § 541.154(c)(1). Kennard admits that he did not give notice before filing suit, but argues that the statute of limitations exception applies. Kennard's Kennedy Response at 12. In addition, Kennard notes that, subsequent to his June 17, 2005 filing of the instant action, he gave the requisite notice to all defendants. Id. at 13 ("On *610 September 12, 2005, Dr. Kennard served a letter, by facsimile, upon counsel of record for all Defendants, notifying them of Dr. Kennard's specific complaint and the amount of economic damages and expenses, including attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by Dr. Kennard."). Although Kennedy did not respond to this argument, the defendant Xelan addressed an identical contention. Reply to Response to Motion to Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(6) or, in the Alternative, to Abate at 8. Noting that it received notice on September 12, Xelan requested that the court abate this case for the requisite 60 days, i.e., until November 11, 2005. Id. Inasmuch as this case was automatically abated pursuant to the DTPA, see TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE § 17.505(d), (e), and the 60-day period has already expired, there is no reason to formally abate this action. See In re Alford Chevrolet-Geo, 997 S.W.2d 173, 178 (Tex.1999). Accordingly, Kennedy's alternative motion to abate is denied.

B. Xelan's Motion to Dismiss or Abate

Xelan has also filed a motion to dismiss Kennard's claims against it, or in the alternative to abate the action due to lack of pre-suit DTPA notice. See generally Motion to Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(6) or, in the Alternative, to Abate. Citing similar caselaw and advancing analogous arguments, Xelan's motion presents issues identical to those advanced in Kennedy's motion. Rather than repeating this discussion, the court refers to the previous section regarding dismissal for failure to meet Rule 9(b) pleading requirements and abatement for lack of pre-suit DTPA notice. For the reasons stated above, Xe-Ian's motion to dismiss or abate is also denied.

C. Indianapolis Life's Partial Motion to Dismiss

Indianapolis Life seeks dismissal, on three grounds, of one of Kennard's claims against it. See Indianapolis Life Insurance Company's Brief in Support of Its Partial Motion to Dismiss ("Indianapolis Life Motion"). First, Indianapolis Life argues that Article 3.42 of the Texas Insurance Code does not provide for a private right of rescission as sought by Kennard.[6]Id. at 2-3. Indianapolis Life also argues that there is no Texas common law right of rescission with respect to an insurance policy. Id. at 3-5. Finally, Indianapolis Life asserts that since Kennard has not alleged he has suffered any damage as a result of the non-approval of the Kennard policy, the plaintiffs have not adequately pleaded a claim for rescission. Id. at 5.
Kennard does not contest Indianapolis Life's statement that Article 3.42 does not, by its terms, provide a statutory private right of rescission. Plaintiff's Response to Defendant Indianapolis Life Insurance Company's Partial Motion to Dismiss, and Brief in Support ("Kennard's Indianapolis Life Response") at 6. Instead, Kennard argues that Article 3.42 is a means to hold Indianapolis Life accountable for issuing an unapproved life insurance policy. Id. Similar to other areas of Texas law, Springfield v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Insurance Co., 620 S.W.2d 557, 558 (Tex.1981) ("insurers are required by law to use the endorsement forms prescribed by the State Board of Insurance, and a failure to do so would subject them to an action for revocation of their licenses"); *611 Commercial Assurance Co. v. Preston, 115 Tex. 351, 282 S.W. 563, 565 (1926) (quoting Bourgeois v. Northwestern National Insurance Co., 86 Wis. 606, 57 N.W. 347, 348 (1893), for the proposition that such board approval "aims to bring order out of chaos" by reining in the infinite number of possible policy forms), Article 3.42 requires that insurers only issue forms that are approved by the state. TEX. INS.CODE Article 3.42. Rather than basing his claim solely on Article 3.42, Kennard urges that his common law right of rescission is derived from Article 3.42's requirement that an insurer must provide approved forms. Kennard's Indianapolis Life Response at 6-8. Kennard seeks to enforce his common law right to rescission on the theory that Indianapolis Life issued an insurance policy not in compliance with the Texas Insurance Code. Because Kennard is not actually basing his cause of action on a statutory right of rescission under Article 3.42, but instead wishes to proceed under the Texas common law, it is not clear that Texas law would afford him no relief. Indianapolis Life's motion to dismiss on this ground must therefore be denied.
Indianapolis Life's second ground assails this common law right of rescission, arguing that there is no absolute right to rescind insurance contracts in Texas. Indianapolis Life Motion at 3. Both parties rely heavily on two Texas cases, neither of which is directly on point. See Urrutia v. Decker, 992 S.W.2d 440 (Tex.), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1021, 120 S.Ct. 530, 145 L.Ed.2d 411 (1999); see also Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York v. Daddy$ Money, Inc., 646 S.W.2d 255 (Tex. App.Dallas 1982, writ ref'd n.r.e.). The only pertinent discussion from these cases is found in dicta from the Supreme Court of Texas, which offers limited guidance in this case. Specifically, the Supreme Court of Texas noted that an "insured may, upon learning that the insurance is unapproved, elect to rescind it." Urrutia, 992 S.W.2d at 443. Indianapolis Life contends, however, that a claim for rescission does not ripen until an insurer seeks to enforce an unapproved insurance policy against the insured. Indianapolis Life Motion at 4 (citing Daddy$ Money, Inc., 646 S.W.2d at 265-57). With no case law provided by Indianapolis Life directly supporting its argument, and the Texas Supreme Court suggesting that a right of rescission potentially exists for insureds with unapproved insurance policies, the court turns to general Texas contract law for further guidance.
Under Texas law, the decision to grant rescission of a contract lies within the trial court's sound discretion. Barker v. Roelke, 105 S.W.3d 75, 84 (Tex.App. Eastland 2003, pet. denied). "Rescission is an equitable remedy that operates to extinguish a contract that is legally valid but must be set aside due to fraud, mistake, or for some other reason to avoid unjust enrichment." Martin v. Cadle Company, 133 S.W.3d 897, 903 (Tex.App.Dallas 2004, pet. denied). Because rescission "is an equitable remedy used as a substitute for monetary damages when such damages would not be adequate," a court must weigh several factors to determine whether such equitable relief should be granted. Davis v. Estridge, 85 S.W.3d 308, 310 (Tex. App.Tyler 2001, pet. denied). Specifically, the court should look to: the "probability of irreparable damage to the moving party in the absence of relief, [the] possibility of harm to the nonmoving party if the requested relief is granted, and [the] public interest." Id. (citing Wenner v. Texas Lottery Commission, 123 F.3d 321, 325 (5th Cir.1997)). It should be noted, however, that "[t]he right to rescind a contract may be lost by inaction and conduct showing an affirmation of the contract after a knowledge of the facts which are grounds for rescission." Barker, 105 S.W.3d at 84.
*612 Here, Kennard is seeking rescission because of alleged misrepresentations by Indianapolis Life in issuing unapproved life insurance policies in the state of Texas and Indianapolis Life's agents in marketing these insurance policies as legal tax shelters. Original Complaint ¶¶ 18, 19 & 29. Should the court grant the requested equitable relief, Indianapolis Life will no longer have a paying customer and Kennard will receive the amounts paid in premiums minus any benefit he has received. In other words, both parties will be returned to status quo ante and neither will be unjustly enriched as a result of the transaction. See Boyter v. MCR Construction Co., 673 S.W.2d 938, 941 (Tex.App.Dallas 1984, writ ref'd n.r.e.) ("To be entitled to the equitable remedy of rescission, . . . a party must show . . . that he and the other party are in status quo, i.e., that he is not retaining benefits received under the instrument without restoration to the other party."). By allowing rescission of the insurance policy, a court would be upholding the public interest by assuring that policies distributed in Texas conform to the Texas Insurance Code and that if they do not, the insured will not be bound to a questionable policy, unapproved by the state. When the facts here are viewed in the light most favorable to Kennard, as they must be on a motion to dismiss, there is no indication that Kennard knew that the policy was unapproved or that the tax shelter was not legal. Since Kennard's behavior does not indicate affirmance of the unapproved insurance policy and the Texas Supreme Court has already intimated that the insured may rescind an insurance policy upon learning that the policy is unapproved, the court is unable to say that Kennard can prove no set of facts in support of his claims that would entitle him to relief. The motion to dismiss on this ground is accordingly denied.
The court now turns to address Indianapolis Life's third argument for dismissal: harm. As stated above, rescission is an equitable remedy, so such relief is not granted for a mere breach of contract. Freyer v. Michels, 360 S.W.2d 559, 561 (Tex.App.Dallas 1962, writ dism'd). Instead, a plaintiff must show that he will sustain "serious and irreparable pecuniary injury" unless rescission is granted. Id. at 562. Accordingly, Kennard must show harm in order to prevail on his claim of rescission. Here, in addition to the $500,000 in damages alleged in the complaint, Original Complaint ¶¶ 37, 45, Kennard maintains that he is the subject of an IRS audit as a result of his reliance on Indianapolis Life's representations and that he has already incurred over $40,000 in attorney's fees. Moreover, Kennard has already paid more than $300,000 in premiums to Indianapolis Life for insurance policies unapproved by the Texas Department of Insurance. Id. ¶ 20. Kennard has sufficiently alleged harm resulting from Indianapolis Life's representations that the policy was both approved and would function as a legal tax shelter. Since Kennard has pleaded this element of a claim for rescission, Indianapolis Life's motion to dismiss must be denied on this ground as well.[7]

III. CONCLUSION

For the reasons stated above, the motions are DENIED.
SO ORDERED.
NOTES
[1]  In its motion this defendant refers to itself as )(elan Association. Motion to Dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) or, in the Alternative, to Abate at 1. The plaintiffs refer to this defendant as Xelan, the Economic Association of Health Professionals, Inc. Original Complaint ¶ 9. The court is unsure whether the name should be capitalized but will use the plaintiffs' convention.
[2]  For case of reference, all plaintiffs will collectively be referred to as "Kennard."
[3]  The court notes that Kennedy objects to the consideration of this affidavit in the court's determination of ripeness. Defendant Benjamin Daniel Kennedy, III's Reply to Plaintiffs' Response to Defendant Kennedy's Combined Original Motion to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, to Abate and Brief in Support at 3. The court will look to the affidavit, though, because "[r]ipeness should be decided on the basis of all the information available to the court." 13A C. WRIGHT & A. MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE & PROCEDURE ("WRIGHT & MILLER") § 3532.1 (2d ed.1984) at 136.
[4]  Kennedy argues that the damages claimed against him "differ significantly from their separate damages allegations against" co-defendant Indianapolis Life. Kennedy Motion at 8. Assuming arguendo the truth of this assertion would not defeat jurisdiction over Kennedy. Under the same rationale enunciated above, the court would have diversity jurisdiction over Kennedy's co-defendants and could then exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claims against Kennedy. See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a).
[5]  Because the court finds diversity jurisdiction present in this case, it need not decide the issue of federal question jurisdiction, even though that issue was argued by the parties. In light of existing precedent from this district, however, and the fact that the jury can decide this case without regard to the accuracy of IRS determinations, the presence of federal question jurisdiction seems unlikely. See, e.g., Cantwell v. Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc., No. 3:05-CV-1378-D, 2005 WL 2296049, at *5 (N.D.Tex. Sept. 21, 2005); Leggette v. Washington Mutual Bank, FA, No. 3:03-CV-2909-D, 2005 WL 2679699 (N.D.Tex. Oct. 19, 2005) (explaining and applying federal "arising under" jurisdiction).
[6]  Article 3.42 of the Texas Insurance Code was repealed by the Texas legislature effective April 1, 2005. Section 1701.051(a) is substantially similar to this repealed law, however. See TEX. INS.CODE § 1701.051(a) ("[e]xcept as provided by Section 1701.005, an insurer may not use a document described by Section 1701.002 in this state unless the form of the document is filed with the department in accordance with this chapter").
[7]  While Indianapolis Life may contest whether the harm alleged is sufficient to support rescission of the unapproved insurance policies, the Texas Supreme Court said in Urrutia (without discussion of harm to the insured) that "the insured may, upon learning that the insurance is unapproved, elect to rescind it." Urrutia, 992 S.W.2d at 443.

v.
MOTEL 6, INC., Appellant.
No. 3837-II.
The Court of Appeals of Washington, Division Two.
February 24, 1981.

REED, C.J.
This is an appeal from a jury verdict awarding plaintiff Flo Pearce $35,000 in damages for injuries she sustained in a slip and fall accident on defendant's premises. The dispositive issue raised on appeal is whether it *475 was error not to give defendant's proposed instruction describing the circumstances under which a motel keeper is liable to its guests for injuries sustained on the premises. We hold the instruction should have been given and reverse and remand for new trial.
Defendant Motel 6, Inc., owns and operates a national chain of motels offering modest but comfortable accommodations at economical rates. Plaintiff Flo Pearce occupied a room with her husband in defendant's Fife facility near Tacoma. The Pearces had checked into the motel on July 5, 1976, while traveling on vacation from their home in California.
The accident giving rise to this action occurred when plaintiff fell as she entered the shower stall in the bathroom of her motel room. The shower compartment was of a fiberglass stall construction with a folding accordion-type door and no tub facilities. Plaintiff's testimony was that she first took the precaution of placing a bath towel on the bathroom floor outside the shower stall; after disrobing and running the water in the shower to the proper temperature, she stepped from the towel into the compartment with her right foot. As she transferred weight onto her right foot she slipped and fell, thereby sustaining injury to her left foot and leg.
At trial plaintiff pursued three principal theories of liability: (1) that defendant was negligent in not furnishing mats or by not applying some form of nonskid surface preparation to the shower floor pan; (2) that defendant was negligent in failing to provide grab bars in the shower's interior; and (3) that defendant's employees negligently left a dangerous soap or detergent film on the shower floor after cleaning.[1]
Testimony at trial indicated defendant had not supervised construction of the Fife motel unit, but had acquired *476 it after construction had been completed. The shower stalls used were common to those found on the market at the time the Fife facility was constructed. Plaintiff's expert testified that the stalls had been cleaned and maintained in such a manner that the fiberglass and Gel-Coat finish had retained the same shine, smoothness, and luster as the product had possessed when originally installed. The expert further testified, however, that the fiberglass industry had since improved methods of constructing fiberglass shower stalls such that newer stall floors are more slip resistant. Evidence was admitted which indicated that at the time of the accident at least two surface preparations were available which could have been applied to the early model or smooth surface pans to achieve a similar degree of slip resistance. One preparation is a form of paint which contains an abrasive material that hardens to a rough-textured surface. The other preparation is an adhesive strip which is impregnated with a similarly textured material. Either preparation could have been applied to defendant's shower floor to increase the degree of slip resistance.
In addition to the two shower floor preparations, the plaintiff's expert testified to a comparison he had made between the Fife unit's shower stall and a shower stall found in a new Motel 6 unit in Tumwater. Unlike the Fife facility, defendant had supervised construction of the Tumwater Motel 6. Although not entirely clear from the record, it appears the comparison was made for the purpose of suggesting that defendant was cognizant of both the dangers of and alternatives to smooth surface shower floors. The shower stalls in the Tumwater facility were installed some years after construction of the Fife facility and had been manufactured under the more modern technique of imparting a slip resistant surface to the stall at the time of fabrication.
Defendant's evidence was that, during its nearly 5 years of ownership of the Fife facility, there had been no reports of similar accidents nor had it received any complaints regarding the safety of the shower stalls.
*477 Defendant's first assignment of error is directed to the denial of defendant's motion for directed verdict and judgment n.o.v. Defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient, as a matter of law, to establish either that the shower unit posed an unreasonable risk of harm to users, or that defendant should have realized that fact.
We have serious misgivings about the relevance of much of plaintiff's evidence. Plaintiff's expert appeared to posit his opinion primarily upon his comparison of the relative safety of the Fife and Tumwater facilities. It is of course not enough to say that shower A is more or less dangerous than shower B. No evidence was offered that the Fife unit did not meet industry standards. However, plaintiff described the shower pan surface as "slick as ice" and plaintiff's expert characterized it as constituting a "significant hazard potential for a slip and fall." Furthermore, we believe the evidence, while not strong, was enough to create a jury issue as to defendant's awareness of the condition and the relatively inexpensive means for correcting it. Cf. Bidlake v. Youell, Inc., 51 Wn.2d 59, 315 P.2d 644 (1957) and Doherty v. Arcade Hotel, 170 Or. 374, 134 P.2d 118 (1943).
[1] The same is not true, however, regarding plaintiff's theory that a chambermaid left a dangerous soap film on the shower floor; we note there is hardly a scintilla of evidence to support such a theory. Testimony revealed that after cleaning the shower floor with soap solution the shower was rinsed, dried, and checked by the head chambermaid. Plaintiff further testified that she personally ran the water in the shower for several moments before entering. Plaintiff's only basis for urging such a theory is that on the day following the accident, after the room had been cleaned, plaintiff felt the shower floor and observed it was "quite slippery-like" such that "it felt like there was grease or oil on it." Plaintiff's husband testified that when he examined the shower after it had been cleaned:
There was something that made it slick, yes. I couldn't tell if it was grease, oil, or just the nature of the material.
*478 To conclude that plaintiff slipped on soap film on the basis of this evidence would be utter speculation. To sustain a finding of negligence the evidence must be substantial and not a mere scintilla. Hojem v. Kelly, 93 Wn.2d 143, 606 P.2d 275 (1980). The trial judge should not have permitted this theory to go to the jury.
After instructing on the general definitions of negligence and contributory negligence, burden of proof, proximate cause and damages, the trial court gave, as its only instruction defining the duty or duties owed by defendant to plaintiff, the following:
The operator of a motel owes to a person who has an express or implied invitation to come upon the premises in connection with that business, a duty to exercise ordinary care for his safety. This includes the exercise of ordinary care to maintain in a reasonably safe condition those portions of the premises which such person is expressly or impliedly invited to use or which he might reasonably be expected to use.
[2] The trial court refused, however, to give defendant's proposed instruction which read as follows:
A hotel/motel operator is liable for physical harm caused to its guests by a condition of the premises if, but only if, it
(a) knows or by the exercise of reasonable care would discover the condition and should realize that it involves an unreasonable risk of harm to such guests, and
(b) should expect that they will not discover or realize the danger, or will fail to protect themselves against it, and
(c) fails to exercise reasonable care to protect them against the danger.
As applied to plaintiff's basic theory that the shower as originally constructed and maintained was a dangerous instrumentality which defendant could have rendered safe by utilizing methods currently available, the proposed instruction was a correct statement of the law governing the case. The failure to give the instruction precluded defendant from meaningfully presenting its case and from arguing *479 its theories of defense to the jury and consequently of a fair trial. In Leek v. Tacoma Baseball Club, Inc., 38 Wn.2d 362, 229 P.2d 329 (1951), the court said:
Basic in the law of negligence is the tenet that the duty to use care is predicated upon knowledge of danger, and the care which must be used in any particular situation is in proportion to the actor's knowledge, actual or imputed, of the danger to another in the act to be performed. Burr v. Clark, 30 Wn. (2d) 149, 190 P. (2d) 769; 38 Am. Jur. 678, Negligence, § 32; 65 C.J.S. 351, Negligence, § 5.
This principle is an integral part of the law relating to the liability of owners or occupants of premises. Generally speaking, the possessor of land is liable for injuries to a business visitor caused by a condition encountered on the premises only if he (a) knows or should have known of such condition and that it involved an unreasonable risk; (b) has no reason to believe that the visitor will discover the condition or realize the risk; and (c) fails to make the condition reasonably safe or to warn the visitor so that the latter may avoid the harm. Hudson v. Kansas City Baseball Club, 349 Mo. 1215, 164 S.W. (2d) 318, 142 A.L.R. 858; 2 Restatement of Torts 938, § 343; 38 Am. Jur. 754, Negligence, § 96; 65 C.J.S. 521, Negligence, § 45.
Leek v. Tacoma Baseball Club, Inc., supra at 365-66. Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343 (1965); see also Knight v. Wandermere Co., 46 Wn.2d 768, 284 P.2d 1106 (1955); Winkler v. Seven Springs Farm, Inc., 240 Pa. Super. Ct. 641, 359 A.2d 440 (1976).
[3] Plaintiff argues that defendant was entitled to no more than the general instruction which was given and was able effectively to argue its defenses to the jury. We do not agree. First, nowhere was the jury told that before it could find defendant had breached its duty of due care to plaintiff, it must find that defendant knew or should have known the shower facility presented an unreasonable risk of harm. Second, nowhere was the jury advised that defendant's duty was tempered by what it could reasonably expect its guests would perceive for themselves, e.g., that fiberglass shower floors become slippery when wet. Miller v. Shull, 48 *480 So.2d 521 (Fla. 1950); LaBart v. Hotel Vendome Corp., 213 F. Supp. 958 (D. Mass. 1963); Dempsey v. Alamo Hotels, Inc., 76 N.M. 712, 418 P.2d 58 (1966), overruled on other grounds in Williamson v. Smith, 83 N.M. 336, 491 P.2d 1147 (1972). As instructed, the jury could have considered the care and attention exercised by plaintiff for her own safety only as such evidence bore on the defense of contributory negligence and not for any bearing it may have had on defendant's primary duty of due care. As stated in Leek v. Tacoma Baseball Club, Inc., supra at 366, one of the three conditions which must be met before the possessor of land may be found liable is that the possessor "has no reason to believe that the visitor will discover the condition or realize the risk". Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343(b) (1965). In short, the failure to give defendant's proposed instruction virtually rendered defendant an insurer upon a finding only that the shower fixture was unreasonably dangerous and proximately caused plaintiff's injury. Motel owners are not guarantors or insurers of the safety of their business invitees. Cf. Hemmen v. Clark's Restaurant Enterprises, 72 Wn.2d 690, 434 P.2d 729 (1967); Engdal v. Owl Drug Co., 183 Wash. 100, 48 P.2d 232 (1935).
[4] Each party to a negligence action is entitled to have his theory of the case presented to the jury by proper instructions, there being evidence in support thereof. Egede-Nissen v. Crystal Mountain, Inc., 93 Wn.2d 127, 606 P.2d 1214 (1980). When there is a request for an appropriate instruction which relates the principles of law involved to the issues in the case, it is not enough to simply apprise the jury in general or abstract terms that a party claims the other was negligent. Kiemele v. Bryan, 3 Wn. App. 449, 476 P.2d 141 (1970). As stated in Dabroe v. Rhodes Co., 64 Wn.2d 431, 392 P.2d 317 (1964):
Nowhere in the instructions is there any reference to what the claimed negligence of the defendants might be, except the statement of plaintiffs' contention in instruction No. 1, "that the defendants negligently operated and maintained the escalator."

*481 ...
The plaintiffs were, of course, entitled to have their theories of the case presented to the jury by proper instructions, there being evidence to support them; and their right was not affected by the fact that the law was covered in a general way by the instructions given. DeKoning v. Williams (1955), 47 Wn. (2d) 139, 141, 286 P. (2d) 694; Allen v. Hart (1948), 32 Wn. (2d) 173, 176, 201 P. (2d) 145.
(Footnote omitted.) Dabroe, at 435.
The prejudice to defendant in this case was compounded by the court's refusal to give defendant's "issues" instructions.[2]Woods v. Goodson, 55 Wn.2d 687, 349 P.2d *482 731 (1960); see also WPI 20.01, 20.05, 6 Wash. Prac. 117 (1980) and the official comments to WPI, pages 119-20. This omission must have been particularly confusing to the jury because the court's burden of proof instruction contained the following:
The plaintiff has the burden of proving each of the following propositions:
First, that the defendant acted, or failed to act, in one of the ways claimed by the plaintiff and that in so acting or failing to act, the defendant was negligent;
...
The defendant has the burden of proving both of the following propositions:
First, that the plaintiff acted, or failed to act, in one of the ways claimed by defendant, and that in so acting, or failing to act, the plaintiff was negligent ...
(Italics ours.)
Because of these errors in the instruction phase of the case, the judgment on the verdict must be reversed. Accordingly, we do not reach defendant's other assignments of error, except to note that the trial court was correct in refusing an instruction based on WPI 120.06.02.[3] Such an instruction pertains only where there is evidence of a temporary condition of the premises, created by someone other than the possessor or its agents. Hampton v. Lynch Motor Co., 6 Wn. App. 644, 495 P.2d 345 (1972). Here, there was no evidence to support such an instruction.
*483 Reversed and remanded for new trial.

NOTES
[1]  This theory was not pleaded, but was interjected at trial after defendant offered evidence the showers were cleaned routinely with a "non-abrasive" detergent.
[2]  Defendant's proposed instruction No. 6 reads as follows:

"(1) The plaintiff claims that the defendant was negligent in one or more of the following respects:
"(a) Failing to provide shower mats or other safety devices to place on the floor of the shower stall;
"(b) Failing to install handrails or other safety devices to enable plaintiff to hold onto for support;
"(c) Providing plaintiff with a shower stall which was defective in design for the safety of persons using the same, that is, the floor of the shower stall was smooth and slippery and said stall had no handrails;
"(d) Failing to exercise due care and caution for the safety of the plaintiff.
"The plaintiff claims that one or more of these acts was a proximate cause of the injuries sustained. The defendant denies these claims.
"(2) In addition the defendant claims as an affirmative defense that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent in the following respects:
"(a) Failing to exercise due care and caution in the use of defendant's shower facilities.
"The defendant claims that such failure was a proximate cause of plaintiff's own injuries. The plaintiff denies this claim.
"(3) The defendant further claims and plaintiff denies the following affirmative defense:
"(a) Plaintiff knew and appreciated the specific dangers and hazards associated with the activity in which she was engaged and voluntarily assumed the risks incidental thereto.
"(4) Lastly, the defendant denies the nature and extent of the injuries claimed by plaintiff to have proximately resulted from defendant's alleged acts or omissions."
Proposed instruction No. 7 reads as follows:
"The foregoing is merely a summary of the claims of the parties. You are not to take the same as proof of the matters claimed; and you are to consider only those matters which are established by the evidence. These claims have been outlined solely to aid you in understanding the issues."
[3]  Defendant's proposed instruction No. 16 reads as follows:

"In order to support a finding of negligence, a temporary unsafe condition of the premises which was not created by defendant or defendant's employees, and which was not caused by negligence on defendant's part, must either have been brought to the actual attention of defendant or defendant's employees or it must have existed for a sufficient length of time and under such circumstances that defendant or defendant's employees should have discovered it in the exercise of ordinary care."

OPINION
WEISBERG, Judge.
This is a special action review of an Arizona Industrial Commission ("Commission") Decision Upon Hearing And Finding And Award, and Decision Upon Review modifying the Award. For the following reasons, we affirm.
PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL HISTORY
Thomas Faraghar ("Faraghar"), petitioner employer, worked as a stockbroker for Chelsea *530 Street Securities, Inc. ("Chelsea"). Kathleen Lord ("claimant") worked for Faraghar as a "cold-caller," an individual hired by a broker to make unsolicited calls to find potential customers for that broker. On February 5, 1992, claimant slipped and fell in the common hallway of Chelsea's offices. In November 1992, she filed a workers' compensation claim naming Faraghar as her employer. Chelsea was not named as an employer and has never been a party to this action. Faraghar was uninsured and, accordingly, the No Insurance Division of the Commission processed the claim. After the No Insurance Division denied condensability, claimant requested a hearing.
Claimant, Faraghar, and the former manager of Chelsea testified at the ensuing hearing.[1] Faraghar contended that claimant was Chelsea's employee and, therefore, Chelsea was exclusively liable for claimant's workers' compensation claim. In addition to the testimony of these witnesses, the record included a representative copy of Chelsea's standard stockbroker employment agreement, pursuant to which Faraghar worked for Chelsea. Under this form of agreement, a stockbroker is labelled an employee of Chelsea, is compensated by commission only, and is made financially responsible for specified losses and operating expenses. Among other duties, the stockbroker must attempt "to expand the number of customers who invest in securities through the Employee with the Company." The agreement is silent, though, as to the status of a cold-caller. The practice of Chelsea, however, was that the hiring broker would personally pay the hired cold-caller, and would not be reimbursed by Chelsea.
While the decision to hire a cold-caller was left to the individual stockbroker, Chelsea's manager had to approve each hiring. Therefore, when Faraghar decided to hire claimant, he sought and obtained his manager's approval. Claimant then completed a uniform application and underwent security screening, as required of all Chelsea employees.
Faraghar initially assigned claimant clerical tasks, but subsequently had her cold-call for him. Faraghar personally trained claimant to cold-call, set her work hours and production quotas, and paid her a lump sum of $1000.00 per month from his own account funds. Although she cold-called only for Faraghar, she worked at Chelsea's office and used its equipment. Also, when cold-calling, claimant used a script provided by Chelsea and identified herself as being associated with both Chelsea and Faraghar.
Claimant testified that Faraghar told her that she worked only for him. She considered Faraghar to be her employer and did not receive the fringe benefits received by other employees of Chelsea. Faraghar, on the other hand, testified that he told claimant that she worked for both him and Chelsea.
While Chelsea maintained the right to control the details of stockbrokers' work and that of any of the stockbrokers' cold-callers, claimant's work never presented a situation that required its attention. Although Chelsea monitored the productivity of its stockbrokers, it did not monitor the productivity of cold-callers.
Several months after claimant's industrial injury, and for unrelated reasons, a Chelsea executive directed Faraghar to fire claimant. Faraghar complied. Nevertheless, claimant continued to occasionally cold-call for Faraghar out of her home until he left Chelsea, at which time she resumed full-time cold-calling for him at his new brokerage.
Following the hearing, the Administrative Law Judge ("ALJ") issued an award for a compensable claim. She concluded that Chelsea employed Faraghar and that Chelsea and Faraghar jointly employed claimant. Therefore, both were responsible for providing workers' compensation insurance for claimant. The ALJ also concluded that Chelsea's liability was primary and Faraghar's secondary.
On administrative review, the ALJ modified the award to delete the finding as to primary and secondary liability. She substituted a finding that both Chelsea and Faraghar are liable for claimant's workers' compensation *531 benefits.[2] Faraghar then brought this special action.
STANDARD OF REVIEW
We consider the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the award. Special Fund Div. v. Industrial Comm'n, 172 Ariz. 319, 321, 836 P.2d 1029, 1031 (App. 1992). We will sustain the award if it is reasonably supported by the evidence. Id. Notwithstanding, we apply a de novo standard of review to the ALJ's determination of an employer-employee relationship. Central Management Co. v. Industrial Comm'n, 162 Ariz. 187, 189, 781 P.2d 1374, 1376 (App. 1989); Anton v. Industrial Comm'n, 141 Ariz. 566, 569, 688 P.2d 192, 195 (App. 1984).
DISCUSSION
Faraghar does not dispute the ALJ's finding that both he and claimant were employees of Chelsea. Rather, Faraghar argues that, as claimant's co-employee, Faraghar cannot also be her employer, and therefore cannot be responsible for providing workers' compensation coverage. He contends that, for worker's compensation purposes, only Chelsea was claimant's employer and was therefore exclusively responsible for providing her workers' compensation coverage. To support his argument, Faraghar cites several cases in which either subservants or statutory employees have brought successful claims against their masters or statutory employers, or in which the latter have successfully asserted immunity from civil actions. See Mahan v. Litton, 321 S.W.2d 243 (Ky. 1959) (master immunized from civil suit by subservant); Mill Street Church of Christ v. Hogan, 785 S.W.2d 263 (Ky.App. 1990) (subservant successfully claimed compensation against master); Carlson v. Cain, 204 Mont. 311, 664 P.2d 913 (1983) (statutory employee successfully claimed compensation against statutory employer when contractor/employer uninsured); cf. State Compensation Ins. Fund v. Castle Mountain Corp., 227 Mont. 236, 739 P.2d 461 (1987) (imposing primary liability on insured contractor/employer and secondary liability on insured statutory employer).
We, however, reject Faraghar's position. Initially, we disagree that co-employee status as to a common employer is legally inconsistent with one of the employees employing the other for workers' compensation purposes. At least two Arizona cases have considered such a relationship legally possible, although the court in each case concluded that its facts did not support that result because there was insufficient evidence that one co-employee had the right to control the details of the other's work. See Special Fund Div., 172 Ariz. at 321-24, 836 P.2d at 1031-34 (setting aside award imposing joint liability for lack of evidence that shingler exercised control over helper); Central Management Co., 162 Ariz. at 192, 781 P.2d at 1379 (affirming award imposing single rather than dual liability because only cab company controlled details of the claimant's work as cab driver).
In the instant case, though, Faraghar had the right to control the details of claimant's work as a cold-caller. See, e.g., Home Ins. Co. v. Industrial Comm'n, 123 Ariz. 348, 350, 599 P.2d 801, 803 (1979) (applying right of control test to determine employer-employee relationship). Faraghar set claimant's hours, established her quotas, and judged her efficiency as a cold-caller. Faraghar was personally responsible for paying claimant and was not reimbursed by Chelsea. Also, although subject to Chelsea's approval, Faraghar alone determined whether to hire claimant as his cold-caller. Moreover, while it was Chelsea who ordered claimant's termination, Faraghar also had the right to fire her. We therefore hold that, even if both Faraghar and claimant were employees of Chelsea, the ALJ correctly concluded that claimant was an employee of Faraghar as well.
Having held that Faraghar was an employer of claimant, we further conclude that he is liable for her workers' compensation coverage regardless whether claimant's *532 relationship to Chelsea was that of a joint employee, sub-employee, or statutory employee. First, if Faraghar and Chelsea were joint employers of claimant, liability would be joint and several. See 1B A. Larson, Workmen's Compensation Law § 48.45 at 8-5777 to 8-5778 (1986).
Next, if claimant were Chelsea's sub-employee, Faraghar would still be liable to claimant. "An agent who employs a subservant or other subagent has the duties and liabilities of a principal to him." Restatement (Second) of Agency § 459 at 378 (1958). The agent/employer consequently may be "required to pay workmen's compensation to an employee who was his servant." See Warren A. Seavey, Subagents and Subservants, 68 Harv.L.Rev. 658, 664 (1955) (citing Lee v. Oreon E. & R.G. Scott Realty Co., 96 S.W.2d 652 (Mo. App. 1936)).
Finally, the result does not change if claimant were Chelsea's statutory employee. A.R.S. section 23-902(B) provides:
When an employer procures work to be done for him by a contractor over whose work he retains supervision or control, and such work is a part or process in the trade or business of the employer, then such contractors and the persons employed by him, and his sub-contractor ... are, within the meaning of this section, employees of the original employer.
The statutory employer statute thus imposes on the original employer the responsibility to provide workers' compensation coverage for the independent contractor's employees. Nothing in the statute, however, suggests that the original employer's responsibility is exclusive, or that the independent contractor is thereby relieved of liability for benefits. See, e.g., Young v. Environmental Air Products, Inc., 136 Ariz. 158, 160, 665 P.2d 40, 42 (1983) (noting that plaintiffs recovered workers' compensation benefits from insured contractor/employer, but subjecting original employer to civil suit only because it did not meet the requirements of a statutory employer); Greenway Baptist Church v. Industrial Comm'n, 130 Ariz. 482, 487, 636 P.2d 1264, 1269 (App. 1981) (stating that, under section 23-902(B), claimant is employee of both the statutory employer and the independent contractor); Hamrick v. Industrial Comm'n, 15 Ariz. App. 277, 279, 488 P.2d 482, 484 (1971) (holding that "a determination by an award that a workman is an employee of a subcontractor does not preclude a subsequent determination that this same workman is an employee of the original contractor"). We also note that, when imposing liability for compensation benefits, a liberal interpretation of section 23-902(B) furthers the purposes of the Workmen's Compensation Act. Young, 136 Ariz. at 163, 665 P.2d at 45.
The cases cited by Faraghar are not to the contrary. See Hogan, 785 S.W.2d 263; Mahan, 321 S.W.2d 243; Carlson, 664 P.2d 913; Castle Mountain Corp., 739 P.2d 461. None of them involves a claimant who sought benefits exclusively from the intermediate employer. Instead, they involve claims or suits either against only the master/statutory employer or against both employers. Moreover, not one of the cases holds that the master/statutory employer is exclusively liable. These cases merely establish the liability for compensation benefits, or the concomitant immunity from civil suit, of the master or statutory employer. They do not establish the immunity of the intermediate employer in the case of an exclusive claim.
The injured workers in the cases cited by Faraghar simply were seeking recovery from an insured or otherwise financially responsible party. An injured worker in Arizona formerly had the same pragmatic incentive for filing a claim against a master or statutory employer with insurance or deep pockets rather than against an employee/employer or contractor/employer without insurance or resources. See Code 1939, § 56-1231 (Supp. 1952) (treating award for compensable claim as judgment enforceable in superior court). Then, in 1968, the legislature first gave the Commission discretion to pay compensation to claimants of uninsured employers from the special fund. See 1968 Ariz. Sess. Laws Ch. 6, 1014-1015. Finally, in 1973, the legislature mandated compensation from the special fund in such cases. See 1973 Ariz. Sess. Laws Ch. 136, 963, 964. In addition, although a claimant used to have an interest in filing multiple claims if more than one employer paid wages to her, see Butler v. Industrial Comm'n, 50 Ariz. 516, 525, 73 *533 P.2d 703, 706 (1937), a claimant may now receive credit for wages paid by every employer in a claim against any single employer. See Wiley v. Industrial Comm'n, 174 Ariz. 94, 104, 847 P.2d 595, 605 (1993) (amended opinion). Consequently, even if the ALJ is correct that claimant was employed by both Faraghar and Chelsea, claimant had no financial interest in filing a claim against Chelsea. Faraghar is therefore solely responsible for claimant's worker's compensation coverage because of the unique history of her claim: he was the only employer against whom she filed a claim.[3]
CONCLUSION
We conclude that, regardless of the nature of Chelsea's relationship to either claimant or Faraghar, Faraghar was responsible for providing claimant's workers' compensation coverage because he was her employer, and was the only employer named in the claim. Accordingly, we affirm the award.
EHRLICH, P.J., and VOSS, J., concur.
NOTES
[*]  Corcoran, J., of the Supreme Court, did not participate in the determination of this matter.
[1]  A former stockbroker with Chelsea also appeared and provided corroborative testimony.
[2]  In stating that both Chelsea and Faraghar were liable, the ALJ evidently meant that Chelsea was liable in the abstract only, since it was not named in the claim and never made a party to the action.
[3]  The parties with a financial interest, the No Insurance Division and Faraghar, did not attempt to join Chelsea. We accordingly need not address whether the No Insurance Division or Faraghar had the right to request joinder of Chelsea. See Ariz.Admin.Code R4-13-150 (1987) (allowing any interested party to request joinder of other interested party).

Ex parte Darin Anthony JONES.
(Re Darin Anthony Jones v. State).
1901702.
Supreme Court of Alabama.
December 20, 1991.
Thomas M. Goggans, Montgomery, for appellant.
*211 James H. Evans, Atty. Gen., and Margaret S. Childers, Asst. Atty. Gen., for appellee.
SHORES, Justice.
The petitioner, Darin Anthony "Rollo" Jones, was convicted of murder in the Circuit Court of Etowah County and was sentenced to life imprisonment. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed. The trial court had admitted as evidence the gun allegedly used by Jones. Jones claims that there was a break in the chain of custody of that gun and, therefore, that the trial court erred in allowing it into evidence.
On December 27, 1989, Ishmeal Ransaw, Kevin Traylor, Vada Samuels, and Willie Brown were riding around Gadsden, Alabama, in Traylor's automobile. They were looking for Glenn Williams for the purpose of inflicting some type of harm upon him. They stopped at Shaw's convenience store, where they saw Bobby Rudolph and Jones. Samuels told Jones that they were looking for Williams, and Jones responded by saying that he wanted "a piece of the action." Jones and Rudolph then got into Traylor's car.
Traylor drove to Jones's house, where Jones retrieved a shotgun from the trunk of another car. Jones got back into Traylor's car and they drove to a location near Carver Community Center; Samuels also had a shotgun with him. Brown got out of the car and subsequently began fighting with Williams. Ransaw testified that thereafter Jones got out of the car, placed his gun over the top of the car and fired at least two shots; Samuels also began firing shots.
Traylor then drove, with Rudolph, Jones, and Samuels, to Atlanta; on the way there, Jones stated "I got him. I got him," and also said that he had shot Williams first. Samuels stated that, as he and Brown were running off, Williams was calling his name, and that he went back and loaded one more shell and shot him again. Samuels also stated that he had hidden his gun by a Marvin's hardware store; on January 15, 1990, Samuels's gun was found beside a Marvin's hardware store.
During the trial, Ransaw identified State's exhibit number one as Samuels's gun and identified State's exhibit number 38 as the gun used by Jones. Faye Gary, a lieutenant with the Gadsden Police Department, testified that she received a telephone call on February 26, 1990, at her home, from a confidential informant; she said she met with the informant and at the meeting was given State's exhibit number 38. She testified that she took the gun home with her and kept it until 8:00 a.m. the next morning, when she carried it to city hall and gave it to Lieutenant Jeffrey E. Wright.
Lieutenant Gary testified that her informant told her that he was given this gun by an unidentified person and that this unidentified person told Gary that he had bought it for $5 from a small child who had seen it being put in a ditch behind the Carver Community Center. Gary also testified that when she turned the gun over to Lieutenant Wright, it was in the same, or substantially the same, condition as it was in when she received it from the informant.
Jones does not dispute the chain of custody of the gun after it was placed into officer Gary's custody. Jones contends only that there was insufficient testimony as to the whereabouts of the gun between the time of the offense and its initial delivery to Lieutenant Gary; therefore, he argues, there was a break in the chain of custody and the gun should have been excluded from evidence. The trial court admitted into evidence exhibit number 38 over Jones's chain-of-custody objection. Jones was found guilty of murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, stating in an unpublished memorandum opinion, 586 So.2d 304, that Jones's chain-of-custody argument was "without merit, because the chain of custody began when the shotgun was seized." We agree.
"`To warrant the reception of an object in evidence against an objection that an unbroken chain of custody has not been shown, it is not necessary that it be proved to an absolute certainty, but only *212 to a reasonable probability, that the object is the same as, and not substantially different from, the object as it existed at the commencement of the chain.'"
Laws v. State, 562 So.2d 305, 306 (Ala.Cr. App.1990).
"`The purpose for requiring that the chain of custody be shown is to establish to a reasonable probability that there has been no tampering with the evidence. Williams v. State, 375 So.2d 1257 (Ala. Cr.App.), cert. denied, 375 So.2d 1271 (Ala.1979); Tate v. State, 435 So.2d 190 (Ala.Cr.App.1983); Smith v. State, 446 So.2d 68 (Ala.Cr.App.1984). "The evidence need not negate the most remote possibility of substitution, alteration, or tampering with the evidence, but rather must prove to a reasonable probability that the item is the same as, and not substantially different from, the object as it existed at the beginning of the chain." Slaughter v. State, 411 So.2d 819, 822 (Ala.Cr.App.1981) (emphasis supplied).'"
Williams v. State, 505 So.2d 1252, 1253 (Ala.Cr.App.1986), aff'd, 505 So.2d 1254, 1255 (Ala.1987). A gun is properly admitted into evidence when it is identified at trial as being the weapon used in the commission of the offense. Sumpter v. State, 480 So.2d 608, 613-14 (Ala.Cr.App.1985).
Because there was no link missing from the chain of custody of exhibit number 38 and there was a positive identification of the shotgun by Ransaw, a witness to the murder who had personal knowledge of the gun that Jones took to the scene of the crime and which he saw Jones fire, the trial court correctly admitted the gun into evidence.
For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals is due to be affirmed.
AFFIRMED.

                                MEMORANDUM OPINION[1]
 
                                              ------------
On April 1, 2009, the trial court entered
judgment on the jury=s verdict after the jury found
Appellant Michael Blake Bourne guilty of aggravated assault with a deadly
weapon and assessed twenty-eight years=
confinement as punishment.  Bourne did
not file a motion for new trial; therefore, his notice of appeal was due May 1,
2009.  See Tex. R. App. P.
25.2(b), 26.2(a)(1).




On June 4, 2009, we notified Bourne=s
appellate counsel of our concern that we lacked jurisdiction over this appeal
because Bourne=s notice of appeal was not filed
in the trial court until May 4, 2009.[2]  We informed him that the appeal was subject
to dismissal for want of jurisdiction unless he filed a response on or before
June 15, 2009, advising us whether the mailbox rule would apply in this case.  See Tex. R. App. P. 9.2(b).  Bourne=s
appellate counsel=s reply, dated June 8, 2009, and
received by the court on June 9, 2009, fails to provide this court with a basis
to exercise jurisdiction.




A notice of appeal that complies with the
requirements of rule 26 of the rules of appellate procedure is essential to
vest this court with jurisdiction over an appeal.  See Tex. R. App. P. 26.2(a)(1); Slaton
v. State, 981 S.W.2d 208, 210 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998).  The court of criminal appeals has expressly
held that without a timely filed notice of appeal or motion for extension of
time, we cannot exercise jurisdiction over an appeal.  See Olivo v. State, 918 S.W.2d 519, 522
(Tex. Crim. App. 1996) (AWhen a notice of appeal is filed
within the fifteen‑day period [in rule 26.3] but no timely motion for
extension of time is filed, the appellate court lacks jurisdiction.@).  Here, we lack jurisdiction to dispose of the
purported appeal in any manner other than by dismissing it for lack of
jurisdiction.  See id. at
523.  Therefore, we must dismiss the
appeal for lack of jurisdiction.[3]  See Tex. R. App. P. 26.2(a)(1),
43.2(f).

MEMORANDUM OPINION

(Denying Dismissal, Transfer, or Stay)
LAMBERTH, District Judge.
This matter comes before the court on Defendants' Motion to Dismiss or Transfer or, in the Alternative, for a Stay ("Defendants' Motion"); Plaintiffs' Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss or Transfer or, in the Alternative, for a Stay of this Action ("Plaintiffs' Opposition"); Defendants' Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss, Transfer, or Stay ("Defendants' Reply"); Plaintiffs' Surreply in Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss or Transfer or, in the Alternative, for a Stay of this Action ("Plaintiffs' Surreply"); and Defendants' Supplemental Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, Transfer, or Stay ("Defendants' Supplement"). Upon consideration of the representations of counsel, and for the reasons presented below, it is hereby ORDERED that Defendants' Motion to Dismiss or Transfer or, in the Alternative, for a Stay is DENIED.

I. FACTS.
This case, as amended, was filed in October 1991 by three professional football players against the National Football League and its twenty-eight member teams. The plaintiffs claim damages under the anti-trust laws arising out of the NFL's "Plan B" right of first refusal/compensation system during the 1989 NFL season.[1]*2 The plaintiffs have since filed a motion for class certification on behalf of all players[2] who were subject to Plan B during the 1989 season.
This case is one of several cases between football players and the NFL that either have recently been litigated or are currently pending. The first case of recent vintage was filed in the District Court for Minnesota in October 1987. Powell v. National Football League, Civ. No. 4-87-917 (D.Minn.). In that case, nine football players filed a class action lawsuit challenging the first refusal/compensation system then in effect. The NFL claimed that a nonstatutory labor exemption to the anti-trust laws applied. U.S. District Judge David Doty agreed in part, holding that the exemption applied to the player/NFL relationship, but only until negotiations between the NFL and the players reached an impasse as to the particular issue in question.
The nonstatutory labor exemption issue was certified to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. That court held that the exemption applied as long as the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) served as the players' collective bargaining representative. Powell v. NFL, 930 F.2d 1293 (8th Cir.1989), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1040, 111 S.Ct. 711, 112 L.Ed.2d 700 (1991). In light of this decision, the NFLPA relinquished its role as the players' collective bargaining representative on November 6, 1991, thus terminating the parties' labor relationship.
Thereafter, eight players filed suit against the NFL, in the District Court of New Jersey, seeking damages under Plan B for the 1990 NFL season. McNeil v. NFL, Civ. Action No. 90-1402 (D.N.J.).[3] On motion by the NFL, the case was transferred to Judge Doty in Minnesota. A trial jury recently found against the defendants, and damages were awarded to four of the eight plaintiffs.
Meanwhile, Judge Doty decertified the class in Powell, on remand from the Eighth Circuit, and dismissed without prejudice the claims of the class members based upon the 1989 season.[4]
Finally, on October 15, 1991, the NFL filed a declaratory judgment action in the District Court for Minnesota against three Minnesota-resident football players and the NFLPA. NFL v. NFLPA and Hilton, Civ. No. 3-91-635 (D.Minn.). The suit seeks a declaratory judgment that the NFL bears no anti-trust liability for the first refusal/compensation restriction as applied during the 1989 season. On October 17, 1991, the three named plaintiffs in this suit brought this action against the NFL and its twenty-eight member teams, their claim being that the NFL's application of the first refusal/compensation system in 1989 violated the anti-trust laws.
Defendants have now filed this motion to dismiss, transfer, or stay plaintiffs' action.

II. DEFENDANTS' ARGUMENTS.
In defendants' view, the basis for this motion is "relatively simple": pending litigation in the District Court for Minnesota and the Eighth Circuit render plaintiffs' suit in this forum duplicative, thus justifying a dismissal, transfer, or stay of the present action. Defendants' Reply at 1.
Duplicative litigation, defendants argue, is to be avoided whenever the equities allow. By allowing only one suit  the firstfiled *3 suit  to go forward, the court saves resources (both of the court and of the parties) and avoids piecemeal litigation and inconsistent adjudication. On this basis, defendants claim that since Hilton, their Minnesota declaratory judgment action, is the first-filed suit, it should be allowed to proceed. Defendants' Motion at 6-7. The defendants do acknowledge that equitable concerns are relevant to the decision as to which litigation will proceed, yet claim that the equities weigh in their favor.
Defendants' first argument is that the present action, as an "exact duplicate" of the first-filed Hilton case, should be dismissed. Defendants' Motion at 8. Defendants claim that the central legal issues raised in this case are "virtually identical" to those in Hilton (at least if the court accepts defendants' claim that the current plaintiffs' claims for damages would be compulsory counterclaims in the Minnesota declaratory judgement action), and thus that "dismissal of this action will not preclude plaintiffs from fully litigating their damage claims." Defendants' Motion at 9.
In the alternative, defendants claim that this case should be transferred under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) to the District Court for Minnesota, "a court that has related cases pending before it and has developed substantial expertise on the subject." Defendants' Motion at 9. Such a transfer would, it is claimed, further the "interest of justice," 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), since 1) there is an identical case, Hilton, already filed in Minnesota; 2) pending litigation in Minnesota and the Eighth Circuit might moot this case; and 3) Judge Doty has already handled "an entire family of related cases," Defendants' Motion at 11, and in so doing has acquired "considerable expertise." Defendants claim that these justifications support transfer and consolidation of this case with Hilton, and that transfer would satisfy the "fundamental statutory goals" of 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a)  the conservation of time and resources and consistent adjudications  without causing plaintiffs any significant inconvenience. As evidence of the reasonableness of this determination, the defendants rely heavily on U.S. District Judge Bissell's decision to transfer McNeil v. NFL from New Jersey to Minnesota.
Finally, defendants' third alternative is to have this court stay this case pending the decisions of the District Court for Minnesota in Hilton and McNeil and the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in Powell.

III. ANALYSIS.
The defendants' arguments raise several issues of federal civil procedure and federal jurisdiction. However, the simple conclusion defendants would have this court reach is not justified by the facts. Rather, the equitable factors which must support defendants' motion under both the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201, and 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) instead weigh in favor of allowing this litigation to continue in this court. Each of defendants' three alternative motions will be addressed in turn.

A. Defendants' Motion to Dismiss: The Hilton Declaratory Judgment Action.

One of defendants' main contentions is that this suit should be dismissed because of the pendency of the earlier-filed declaratory judgement action, NFL v. NFLPA and Hilton, in Minnesota. Defendants claim that the two cases involve similar, if not identical, issues of law and fact and therefore should be consolidated in Minnesota. Although this court believes that the two cases may well be consolidated, it should be done in this court.
Case law involving a declaratory judgment and an inverse action filed in another jurisdiction typically addresses the role of the district court in which the declaratory judgment action is filed. However, from those cases, it is possible to determine an appropriate role for the second court, as well. In this action, the court finds itself in this "second court" role.

1. First to File Rule.
Defendants, having filed the Powell litigation two days prior to the plaintiffs' filing of this case, place heavy emphasis on the first to file rule. This rule typically requires the court of the second-filed case to dismiss or transfer the action before it in *4 favor of comparable litigation previously filed in another jurisdiction. However, that standard is not applied as universally as defendants would have this court believe. In fact, as defendants acknowledge in a footnote, even Columbia Plaza Corp. v. Security Nat'l Bank, 525 F.2d 620 (D.C.Cir.1975), the D.C. Circuit case on which defendants rely for the proposition that duplicative litigation should be avoided, explicitly rejects defendants' contention that the "first to file" rule necessarily determines the proper forum.
In Columbia Plaza, the District of Columbia District Court refused to enjoin the prosecution of a second suit in the Southern District of New York; the second suit was based on matters which, the D.C. plaintiffs alleged, would have been a mandatory counterclaim in the D.C. cause of action. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the solution to the problem of enjoining duplicative litigation "requires a balancing not of empty priorities but of equitable considerations genuinely relevant to the ends of justice." Id. at 628 (citation omitted). Taking its cue from the Supreme Court, the D.C. Circuit noted that "[t]he factors relevant to the wise administration here are equitable in nature." Kerotest Mfg. Co. v. C-O-Two Fire Equip. Co., 342 U.S. 180, 183, 72 S.Ct. 219, 221, 96 L.Ed. 200 (1952).
The court must follow the D.C. Circuit's view that "choice of forum cannot be suitably made by the mechanical application of [the first to file] principle." Columbia Plaza, 525 F.2d at 627. Although the fact that defendants filed their Minnesota case two days prior to the plaintiffs' filing here is relevant, it cannot obscure the fact that equitable concerns and the interest of justice dictate that the action proceed in this court.

2. Equitable considerations.
One consideration in determining which action should proceed is whether it appears that the declaratory judgment action was filed in anticipation of litigation by the other party. Ven-Fuel, Inc. v. Department of the Treasury, 673 F.2d 1194 (11th Cir.1982). Courts have held that such a preemptive strike should be disregarded in selecting the proper forum if equitable concerns so merit. See, e.g., Ven-Fuel; State Farm Fire and Cas. Co. v. Taylor, 118 F.R.D. 426 (M.D.N.C.1988); Yoder v. Heinold Commodities, Inc., 630 F.Supp. 756 (E.D.Va.1986); Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Grand Trunk Western R. Co., 592 F.Supp. 562 (C.D.Pa.1984). Anti-trust cases are no exception. See, e.g., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. v. Union Pacific Resources Co., 750 F.Supp. 311 (N.D.Ill.1990) (court dismissed earlier-filed declaratory judgment action in light of later-filed anti-trust lawsuit).
In this case, it is clear that the NFL filed Hilton to preempt suits brought by players in other fora. At the time it filed Hilton, the NFL had notice of the McNeil and Allen cases (which are based on claims post-dating 1989). In addition, the NFL clearly expected more suits, including suits based on the 1989 season: as paragraph 50 of the NFL's Class Action Complaint for a Declaratory Judgement in Hilton states, "It appears likely that individual players and the NFLPA will take advantage of the District Court's September 30 Order by filing individual anti-trust lawsuits." Complaint at 19. Moreover, even though the defendants disclaim such a motive here, it was certainly in defendants' best interests to adjudicate this matter in a friendly jurisdiction, the Eighth Circuit, rather than to wait for players to file suits in less comfortable fora, such as New Jersey (McNeil), California (Allen), and Washington, D.C. These elements indicate that the NFL's declaratory judgment complaint was a preemptive strike that does not deserve the protection of the first to file rule.
A second equitable concern relevant to the decision to dismiss one of two duplicative lawsuits is that the time of the hearing of the motion to dismiss or transfer, not the time of filing, determines the relevant procedural posture. As of the present time, the existence of this coercive litigation renders moot the declaratory judgment action in Minnesota and argues against the dismissal of this case.
As a third concern, a district court is within its discretion to refuse to entertain a *5 declaratory judgment action when another proceeding in another jurisdiction will resolve the issue in its entirety. Sturge v. Diversified Transport Corp., 772 F.Supp. 183 (S.D.N.Y.1991). See also Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co., 316 U.S. 491, 495, 62 S.Ct. 1173, 1175, 86 L.Ed. 1620 (1942). Defendants readily admit that this case will indeed resolve all issues of law and fact raised by the Hilton action. And, there is no indication that adjudication will be had more quickly in Minnesota than here. Thus, even though this line of cases addresses the role of the "first court," it offers guidance to this court in its "second court" role. There is no reason to transfer this case to Minnesota when full, fair, and complete adjudication of all issues may be had before this court.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the plaintiffs have made the District of Columbia their choice of forum for this action in which they litigate harms allegedly done to them by the NFL defendants. That choice must be afforded proper weight and cannot be dismissed merely because defendants opt for a different forum.
These considerations render the first to file rule inapplicable to the present situation. The equitable concerns weigh in favor of granting the plaintiffs their choice of forum. Thus, defendants' motion to dismiss will be DENIED.

B. Defendants' Motion to Transfer: Forum Shopping, and Equitable Concerns.

Defendants have asserted that the "interest of justice" requires a transfer of this case. 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a). Their first arguments, as in their motion to dismiss, concern forum shopping. In addition, they also claim that the equitable considerations demonstrate that this case should be transferred. Finally, as an example, they rely heavily on Judge Bissell's decision to transfer McNeil v. NFL from New Jersey to Minnesota. Each of these contentions are addressed below.

1. Forum Shopping.
While each party has accused the other of engaging in impermissible forum shopping in choosing the situs of this lawsuit, it is plainly evident that both sides have filed their respective cases in a jurisdiction favorable to their respective positions. Notwithstanding both parties' protestations of innocence, there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the District of Columbia is the proper forum for this suit.
Defendants first claim that Minnesota is the proper forum since it was chosen by the Powell plaintiffs several years ago; defendants claim that the current plaintiffs now should have to abide by that decision. However, although these plaintiffs may have been class members in the Powell case, they were not named plaintiffs and there is no indication that they had any say in where that lawsuit was brought. Thus, there is no reason to bind them to somebody else's strategic decisions.
Defendants next assert that the District of Columbia is an improper forum because no plaintiffs reside here, only one resides close to this district (Mr. Paige resides in Silver Spring, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C.), and even he does not wish to serve as a class representative. Defendants' Supplement at 2. These arguments are unavailing. Under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 and 15 U.S.C. § 22, venue is proper here due to the contacts the defendants have with this district.
Thus, venue is proper in this district; further confirmation of this determination is supplied by equitable factors.

2. Equitable Concerns.
As in the discussion of the motion to dismiss, above, the court finds that, on the whole, the equities run in favor of maintaining this litigation here.
Defendants first note that an identical case, Hilton, is pending before Judge Doty. As demonstrated above, however, there is no magic in the fact that a declaratory judgment action has been filed in Minnesota. In fact, as this opinion demonstrates, the interest of justice indicates that Hilton, *6 not this case, should be transferred or dismissed.
Defendants next claim that litigation in Minnesota and before the Eighth Circuit might moot this case. Since briefs were filed, however, the McNeil[5] case has been decided against the NFL, thus destroying one of their arguments. In the Defendants' Reply, the NFL places great emphasis on the fact that collateral estoppel might bar the claims in this case if the Eighth Circuit were to decide Powell against the players. Of course, collateral estoppel applies to an individual regardless of the forum, and transfer is thus not justified on that basis.
Finally, defendants note the expertise Judge Doty has acquired in NFL anti-trust cases. Of course, this court has already completed a 235-member anti-trust class action against the NFL[6] and has another NFL player anti-trust class action pending.[7] Notwithstanding Judge Doty's expertise, and recognizing that the specific issues in the various cases are not identical, the court feels quite competent in being able to handle the class certification, discovery, and trial matters arising from this particular type of professional football anti-trust case.
When these considerations are combined with the plaintiffs' election of forum and defendants' preemptive declaratory judgment action, discussed above, the equitable concerns again weigh against defendants' motion to transfer.

3. Contrast: The decision to transfer McNeil.

Finally, the defendants claim that the "fundamental statutory goals" of 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) (as cited by defendants), the conservation of time and resources and consistent adjudication, require transfer (even though it appears that these would be satisfied by a unified proceeding in either court). To substantiate their claim that Minnesota is the superior forum, the defendants rely on Judge Bissell's decision to transfer McNeil.
Defendants fail to acknowledge, however, that the situation facing Judge Bissell was radically different from that facing this court. First, Judge Bissell concluded that "[t]he claims in the two cases presently under review in Minnesota encompass the underlying claims presented in the litigation here." McNeil v. NFL, Civ.Act. 90-1402, slip op. at 12 (D.N.J. June 12, 1990). Judge Bissell then noted that the eight McNeil plaintiffs were also members of the Powell class; thus, the relief sought in McNeil was encompassed by that already sought on behalf of the McNeil plaintiffs by virtue of their membership in the Powell class.
On the other hand, this suit, claiming damages for the implementation of the first refusal/compensation system for the 1989 season, is not before Judge Doty; in fact, these claims were omitted from the Powell litigation by Judge Doty's decision. Moreover, these issues have expressly been excluded from consideration by the Eighth Circuit's decision in Powell Thus, the unity of parties and issues evident in McNeil is not present here.
Judge Bissell then sought to avoid creating inconsistent adjudications between New Jersey and Minnesota regarding the players' rights. As this court's decision in Brown v. Pro Football, Inc., No. 99-1071, June 4, 1991, has already determined that the NFL faces anti-trust liability for the 1989 season, consistent adjudication regarding the 1989 season may only be had if this case is tried in this court. Moreover, as that decision is in conflict with the decision of the Eighth Circuit, the creation of a split is no longer an issue.

4. Conclusion.
Therefore, despite defendants' best efforts to demonstrate that Minnesota is the proper forum for this action, defendants' *7 arguments are unavailing. Rather, there appears to be a race to the courthouse, and the interest of justice, the touchstone of 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), demands that defendants' victory in that race not prejudice the valid claims of the plaintiffs. The equities, properly considered, justify trial in this jurisdiction. Defendants' motion to transfer is therefore DENIED.

C. Defendants' Motion to Stay this Case.

Finally, defendants argue that a final alternative would be to stay this lawsuit until the issues are resolved in Hilton, Powell, and McNeil. As discussed above, there is no reason to hold this lawsuit for the declaratory judgment action in Hilton; rather, of the two lawsuits, this one is the superior. Moreover, there is no indication that the Eighth Circuit will reverse Judge Doty's decision in Powell, which closely tracked the Eighth Circuit's first Powell decision. Thus, a stay would only serve to postpone, potentially to plaintiffs' detriment, an inevitable resolution of this case. And finally, the McNeil case has already been decided, and its outcome was not favorable to the NFL. Therefore, a stay of the present lawsuit would serve no purpose and defendants' motion to stay this case is DENIED.

IV. CONCLUSION.
In short, the defendants won the race to the courthouse and beat the plaintiffs in the filing of their anticipated litigation by two days. However, but for the earlier filing date, the equitable concerns do not weigh in favor of a Minnesota trial. Rather, a proper lawsuit lies in this court, and the motion to dismiss, transfer, or stay the present lawsuit will therefore be DENIED.
NOTES
[1]  Plan B was adopted by the National Football League in February 1989. Under the first refusal/compensation system, a player whose contract has expired with one NFL team may negotiate with other NFL clubs. However, before signing with the second club, the first team is given an opportunity to match the contract the player has negotiated with the second team. If the first team chooses not to match the offer, the second club must compensate the first team with draft choices.
[2]  Excluded from the class would be the named plaintiffs in Powell v. National Football League, No. 4-87-917 (D.Minn.). See fn. 4.

BEFORE: GIBBONS, KETHLEDGE, and STRANCH, Circuit Judges.

       JULIA SMITH GIBBONS, Circuit Judge. This § 1983 case arises out of the shooting

death of Reginald Wallace by Nashville police officer Joe Shelton. Plaintiff-appellee Karissa

Sweat alleges that Shelton violated Wallace’s Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive

force. Shelton appeals the district court’s denial of his motion for summary judgment on the

basis of qualified immunity. We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to hear this appeal and

therefore dismiss it.

                                               I.

       On the morning of March 12, 2010, someone broke into Kyle Marion’s home. Marion

was in his bedroom at the time and called 911. When the police arrived, the intruder had left and

several items were missing, including an iPod touch. Shelton, a K-9 officer, was on duty that

day with his dog “Memphis.” Shelton heard about the burglary over the radio dispatch and

drove to the scene of the crime. An officer at the scene took Shelton to the last place where he
No. 12-5869, Karissa Sweat v. Joe Shelton


had seen the suspect. Shelton deployed Memphis using a tracking harness and fifteen-foot

tracking lead and gave Memphis the command to search for the suspect. Eventually, Memphis

ran underneath the deck of a house and Shelton heard someone, later identified as Reginald

Wallace, make a noise “like he had had the wind knocked out of him.” Shelton gave Memphis

the command to apprehend Wallace, which means that Memphis was supposed to bite Wallace.

Shelton looked down to see Memphis and Wallace underneath the deck, but they quickly moved

behind the house, still underneath the deck and out of Shelton’s view. Shelton was surprised by

Wallace’s lack of reaction to Memphis, explaining that:

       Typically . . . when [Memphis] came into contact with somebody, there was a lot
       of screaming, a lot of yelling, people were in fear of the dog. They usually tried
       to fight off the dog. . . . And it was—95 percent of the time they complied
       immediately. . . . They were extremely fearful of the dog. And it was as though
       the dog was not there at all.

Shelton ran to the back of the house, laid down on the ground, and saw Wallace put his hand into

the right pocket of his pants while attempting to crawl out from underneath the deck. Wallace

ignored Shelton’s commands to show his hands and quit resisting. All the while, it appeared that

Memphis was biting Wallace or his clothing. Shelton testified that when Wallace put his hand in

his pocket, Shelton became fearful that Wallace was trying to access a weapon. In response,

Shelton drew his firearm and aimed it at Wallace. Shelton continued giving verbal commands to

Wallace, which were ignored. Shelton described the situation as it progressed:

       He’s struggling to get his hand out of his pocket the whole time he’s crawling.
       He [came] to the end of the deck, at which point I had actually gotten up. I was
       laying on the ground with my firearm pointed at him. I had gotten up and started
       towards the end of the deck in an effort to try to get closer to him when he [came]
       out from under the deck to try to help control him. His hand [came] out of his
       pocket. I could see there was nothing in his hand at that time. . . . He reached up
       and grabbed the deck and pulled himself out from under the deck. . . . Once I saw
       his hand come out, I immediately holstered my firearm and continued to give him
       verbal commands to quit resisting.

No. 12-5869, Karissa Sweat v. Joe Shelton


At that point, Wallace “began kicking [Memphis] wildly.” Shelton advanced toward Wallace

and Memphis as Wallace attempted to escape over a fence in the backyard. Shelton pulled

Wallace off of the fence and Wallace swung his arm back at Shelton, striking “a glancing blow”

on the side of Shelton’s face. Shelton staggered back from the hit. As he approached Wallace

again, Wallace put his hand back into the right pocket of his pants. At this point, Shelton was

behind Wallace and to his right.      Shelton then utilized a technique whereby he “trapped”

Wallace’s hand inside his pocket by placing both of his hands on top of Wallace’s hand. Shelton

said that he “felt a gun.” More specifically, Shelton said he could feel “what felt like the squared

edges of a pistol.” As Wallace’s hand started to come out of his pocket, Shelton “could see what

appeared to be a metal, silverish object.” Wallace did not follow Shelton’s continued commands

to quit resisting. Shelton explained: “I began to think I was too close to the suspect. I could tell

I was losing my hold on him. I went to spin him around to get some distance from him and push

off. And I drew my weapon and fired.” Shelton shot Wallace three times without pausing

between shots. Wallace fell to the ground after he fired the third shot. Shelton said that he fired

the shots because he “was in fear of being shot by Mr. Wallace.” The object in Wallace’s pocket

was the iPod touch owned by Marion. Wallace died that day.

       On June 15, 2010, Quiana Johnson, Karissa Sweat, and Waynnesia Brooks1 filed suit

against the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County, Joe Shelton, and John

Doe police officers. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated Johnson’s constitutional

rights, including his right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure under the Fourth

Amendment. Plaintiffs also brought several state law claims. The district court issued an order

  Quiana Johnson is the mother of Wallace’s son; Karissa Sweat was married to Wallace at the
time of his death; Waynnesia Brooks is Wallace’s daughter. (DE 1, Compl., 1–2.) An
amendment to the complaint, filed on July 19, 2010, added William Wallace, Wallace’s brother,
as a plaintiff. (DE 22, Amend. to Compl., 89.) Only Sweat is a party to this appeal.

on September 13, 2010, dismissing all of the claims except Sweat’s § 1983 claims against

Shelton and the John Doe police officers in their individual capacities based on             alleged

violations of the Fourth Amendment.         After completion of discovery, Shelton moved for

summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity. The district court denied this motion,

reasoning that it could not conclude, as a matter of law, that Shelton’s use of force was

reasonable. Shelton timely appealed.

                                                 II.

       We first consider our jurisdiction over this appeal. Under the collateral order doctrine,

this court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291 to review the district court’s interlocutory

denial of qualified immunity to the extent that it turns on an issue of law. Austin v. Redford Twp.

Police Dep’t, 690 F.3d 490, 495 (6th Cir. 2012). “A defendant raising a qualified immunity

defense ‘may not appeal a district court’s summary judgment order insofar as that order

determines whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a genuine issue of fact for trial.’” Id.

(quoting Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 319–20 (1995)). However, “a defendant denied

qualified immunity may appeal . . . if the issue on appeal is whether the plaintiff’s facts, taken at

their best, show that the defendant violated clearly established law.” Quigley v. Tuong Vinh

Thai, 707 F.3d 675, 680 (6th Cir. 2013). “The district court’s characterization of the basis for its

ruling is not dispositive.” Stoudemire v. Michigan Dep’t of Corr., 705 F.3d 560, 564 (6th Cir.

2013). Even if the district court stated that it denied a defendant’s motion for summary judgment

because of the existence of a genuine issue of material fact, we may exercise appellate

jurisdiction over purely legal issues related to qualified immunity. Id. Although the parties have

not briefed the jurisdictional issue, we have “‘a duty to consider sua sponte whether appellate




                                                -4-
No. 12-5869, Karissa Sweat v. Joe Shelton


jurisdiction is properly invoked.’” Martin v. City of Taylor, 509 F.3d 234, 251 (6th Cir. 2007)

(quoting Mattingly v. Farmers State Bank, 153 F.3d 336, 336 (6th Cir. 1998)).

                                                 III.

       While challenges to the district court’s factual findings are the thrust of Shelton’s appeal,

he also makes two arguments that he seeks to characterize as legal. Stated simply, they are that

(1) the district court applied the wrong legal standard by examining the actual threat to Shelton

instead of Shelton’s reasonable perception of a threat, and (2) the district court inappropriately

applied the standard of Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1 (1985), to this case. Both arguments

rely on inaccurate characterizations of the district court order.

       Shelton is correct that the district court’s denial of summary judgment is partly based on

the threat actually imposed by Wallace. Shelton is also correct that this question is not the

ultimate question for the jury. The ultimate question is whether Officer Shelton’s actions were

objectively reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances. Thus, the reasonableness of

Shelton’s perception that Wallace was a threat and the reasonableness of his response to that

perception would be at issue. But Shelton does not fairly and completely read the district court’s

order. The district court refers to the correct standard. It also cites case law noting that whether

a threat actually exists is relevant to the reasonableness of the officer’s actions. See Ciminillo v.

Streicher, 434 F.3d 461, 467 (6th Cir. 2006). As is clear from Shelton’s brief, this argument

quickly changes from a legal argument to an attack on the district court’s factual findings.

       The other so-called legal argument is merely a criticism of the district court’s choice to

cite Garner in passing. While this case is, as Shelton suggests, more properly categorized as a

self-defense case, as opposed to a fleeing felon case, the district court’s opinion makes clear that

it understood the applicable law.

                                                 IV.

       We now turn to the heart of the matter. The basis for the appeal is the district court’s

finding that genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether Wallace actually posed an

immediate threat to Shelton and whether it was reasonable for Shelton to believe that the object

Wallace had in his pocket was a weapon. Precedent precludes our review of these findings in the

context of an interlocutory appeal challenging denial of qualified immunity. Johnson, 515 U.S.

at 319–20 (“[A] defendant, entitled to invoke a qualified immunity defense, may not appeal a

district court’s summary judgment order insofar as that order determines whether or not the

pretrial record sets forth a ‘genuine’ issue of fact for trial.”); see also Plumhoff v. Rickard, 134 S.

Ct. 2012, 2019 (2014) (“[A]n order denying summary judgment based on a determination of

‘evidence sufficiency’ does not present [an immediately appealable] legal question”); Romo v.

Largen, 723 F.3d 670, 674 (6th Cir. 2013).2

       Any skepticism we may have concerning the correctness of the district court’s findings

that fact issues exist concerning Shelton’s conduct provides no basis for an exception to this rule.

We may reverse a finding of a genuine issue of fact only “where the trial court’s determination



2
  In Romo, the district court denied officer Jeff Largen’s qualified-immunity summary judgment
motion, holding that there were genuine issues of fact regarding whether Largen truly pulled
over the same driver he saw commit a traffic violation and whether he truly felt heat radiating
from the hood of the truck, allegations inconsistent with plaintiff Candido Romo’s contention
that he had been sleeping in his truck on a cold night when Largen approached. 723 F.3d at 673.
This court declined jurisdiction: we noted that “the limitations on interlocutory appeals of
qualified immunity denials [require us] to accept the district court’s finding that a genuine
dispute of material fact existed as to whether Largen fabricated the whole or a part of his story,”
and we “refuse[d] to consider Largen’s factual disputations to the contrary.” Id. at 674 (citing
Johnson, 515 U.S. at 319–20). The Romo court also noted a narrow exception to Johnson for
certain district court orders determining whether the pretrial record sets forth a genuine issue of
fact for trial in the qualified-immunity summary judgment posture: a district court’s
determination that an issue of fact is “genuine” is reviewable only if the district court’s finding is
blatantly and demonstrably false, such that no reasonable jury could believe the plaintiff. Id. at
675 n.3 (internal citations omitted).

that a fact is subject to reasonable dispute is blatantly and demonstrably false.” Romo, 723 F.3d

at 675 n.3 (internal quotation marks omitted).

       The infirmity of the district court’s findings arises from two sources. First, there is a real

question about whether, on this record, the jury could disbelieve Shelton’s account of the events

leading up to the shooting. Typically, “summary judgment is not appropriate where the opposing

party offers specific facts that call into question the credibility of the movant[’]s witnesses.”

TypeRight Keyboard Corp. v. Microsoft Corp., 374 F.3d 1151, 1158 (Fed Cir. 2004). But “when

challenges to witness’ credibility are all that a plaintiff relies on, and he has shown no

independent facts—no proof—to support his claims, summary judgment in favor of the

defendant is proper.” Springer v. Durflinger, 518 F.3d 479, 484 (7th Cir. 2008); TypeRight,

374 F.3d at 1158.     Sweat offers no evidence calling into doubt the veracity of Shelton’s

testimony, and Shelton’s deposition, read in context, is not inconsistent and does not conflict

with other evidence. Sweat argues that Shelton lacks credibility because, had he truly believed

his life was in danger, he would have employed lethal force when he first thought Wallace (then

under the house) had a weapon. This argument may overlook the evidence that Shelton fired

only after he felt a silver, hard, and square-edged object in Wallace’s pocket and after observing

Wallace’s continued refusal to follow Shelton’s demands, but that is not for this court to decide.

       Second, there is a question about the weight given by the district court to expert Phillip

Davidson’s testimony. “Although juries are generally free to believe expert witnesses, a plaintiff

cannot survive summary judgment with an expert’s bare opinion on the ultimate issue.” Hirsch

v. CSX Transp., Inc., 656 F.3d 359, 363 (6th Cir. 2011) (internal citation omitted). “‘[A]n expert

who supplies nothing but a bottom line supplies nothing of value to the judicial process.’”

Brainard v. Am. Skandia Life Assurance Corp., 432 F.3d 655, 664 (6th Cir. 2005) (quoting Mid-

State Fertilizer Co. v. Exch. Nat’l Bank, 877 F.2d 1333, 1339 (7th Cir. 1989)). In Fourth

Amendment excessive force cases, once the court has drawn all reasonable inferences in favor of

the nonmoving party, the determination of whether the defendant’s actions were reasonable

under the Fourth Amendment is a question of law. Scott, 550 U.S. at 381 n.8. It is unclear

whether Davidson offers more than his conclusion on this question of law or whether his opinion

helps the trier of fact to understand the evidence or determine a fact in issue.

        The difficulties posed by the district court’s determinations of the existence of genuine

issues of fact do not, however, rise to the level of blatant and demonstrable falsity. See Romo,

723 F.3d at 675 n.3 (internal citations omitted). Thus, we may not review them in this context.

                                                 V.

        Johnson and our court’s interpretation of it require that we dismiss the appeal for lack of

jurisdiction.

TEXAS COURT OF APPEALS, THIRD DISTRICT, AT AUSTIN





NO. 03-00-00243-CR





Edward Bell, Appellant



v.



The State of Texas, Appellee






FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF TOM GREEN COUNTY, 119TH JUDICIAL DISTRICT

NO. B-98-0433-S, HONORABLE DICK ALCALA, JUDGE PRESIDING






	Appellant Edward Bell appeals his conviction for capital murder.  Tex. Pen. Code
Ann. § 19.03(a)(3) (West 1994).  After the jury found appellant guilty, the trial court assessed
punishment at life imprisonment, the State having waived the death penalty.

Points of Error
	Appellant advances three points of error.  First, appellant challenges the legal
sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction for capital murder.  Second, appellant urges that
the trial court erred in overruling his objection to an application paragraph of the jury charge relating
to parties in this capital murder case for remuneration.  Appellant contends that he could not be
guilty as a party when the primary actor, Luis Ramirez, was not guilty of this aggravated element
(remuneration) of the offense charged.  Third, appellant contends that under Rule 403 of the Texas
Rules of Evidence, the trial court erred in admitting into evidence a handwritten note of Luis
Ramirez found in appellant's wallet because its probative value was outweighed by the danger of
unfair prejudice and the needless presentation of cumulative evidence.  We will affirm the
conviction.

Indictment
 The indictment in pertinent part charged that appellant on or about April 8, 1998 "did
then and there intentionally cause the death of an individual, namely, Nemecio Nandin, by shooting
the said Nemecio Nandin with a deadly weapon, to wit: a firearm, for remuneration and the promise
of remuneration from Luis Ramirez."

Background
	The facts of the case are important in view of appellant's claim that the evidence is
legally insufficient to sustain the capital murder conviction, and to place the other points of error in
proper perspective.
	On April 16, 1998, the decomposing body of twenty-nine year-old Nemecio Nandin
was found buried in a shallow grave near the home of Richard and Lana Riordon on a fifty-acre tract
between Orient and Tennyson in far northeast Tom Green County.  The medical examiner
determined that the cause of death was two shotgun blasts to the head, at least one of which was
caused by a twenty-gauge shotgun.  
	Nandin was a firefighter for the San Angelo Fire Department.  His off-duty business
was repairing washing machines and dryers.  Nandin was last heard from around noon on April 8,
1998, when he called his girlfriend, Carla (1) Bewick, to tell her he was headed to a business call to
repair a washer and a dryer, and that he would call her when he got back into San Angelo that
evening.  Bewick, who testified that her relationship with Nandin was an on-again, off-again one,
related that when Nandin did not call as promised and did not respond to her calls to his cell phone
or pager, she became concerned.  Later in the day, when she went to the Wal-Mart store on North
Bryant Street in San Angelo, she saw Nandin's pick-up truck with a washer and dryer parked near
the rear of the store.  The truck was unlocked.  Nandin was not to be found in the store.  When
Bewick returned to the store later in the evening, the truck was still there.  She was unable to contact
Nandin the next morning at the fire department.  He had not reported for work.  His co-workers
organized a search.  As noted, his body was found on April 16, 1998.
	Dawn Ramirez Holquin had remarried after the offense but prior to the time of the
trial.  She testified that she married Luis Ramirez in 1985.  They had two children and lived in Las
Vegas, Nevada, before moving to San Angelo in 1992.  She related that Luis was an angry, jealous,
and domineering man who had to be in control of everything; that their marriage was very turbulent,
very violent and "not happy"; and that she got a divorce in November 1995.  Dawn testified that she
did not date for a long period after the divorce because of Luis's jealousy.  He told her that "it drove
him crazy to think that you are with other men."
	Dawn related that she first met Nemecio Nandin in June 1995 when he repaired her
dryer.  She encountered him again in October 1997 when he came to the Town and Country store, 
where she was employed, to purchase hot chocolate.  He called her at work that evening to thank her
for the hot chocolate.  Luis was in the store at the time.  She and Nandin began dating.  Dawn
decided to move to Austin to get away from Luis.  On Saturday, December 20, 1997, Nandin came
by her San Angelo home at 7:30 a.m. to tell her goodbye.  While Nandin was there, Luis began
telephoning, telling Dawn to get rid of whomever was there.  She learned that Luis was calling from
a grocery store two blocks away.  After Luis had called seven or eight times, Nandin took the phone
and told Luis to leave Dawn alone and that her life was none of Luis's business.  Later, Dawn heard
a noise and opened the front door to find her children there.  She saw Luis driving away.  It was
Luis's weekend with the children and he had only picked them up the night before.
	Dawn revealed that she saw Nandin again on December 26, 1997, when she brought
the children to San Angelo for their visitation with their father; that on the last week-end in March
1998 Nandin came to Austin to see her; that the following week-end in early April 1998, her children
returned from their visitation with their father; that her daughter reported that her father (Luis) had
become upset when told the children liked Nandin; and that Luis had stated he would take care of
the problem.  Dawn related that Luis had once told her that "if he found out that I was with another
man, he would kill him and then come after me."
	From around Thanksgiving Day of 1997 until the early part of April 1998, appellant
Bell, his girlfriend, Lisa McDowell, and a young child lived with the Riordons on their property near
the Tennyson Road where Nandin's body was later found.  Due to the objections of the Riordons'
landlord, appellant, McDowell, and the child moved in with Timothy and Nicole Hoogstra in their
house in San Angelo.  Hoogstra and appellant had been co-workers on several different construction
sites.  Neither appellant nor McDowell had jobs at the time they moved.  Shortly after the move
when Hoogstra was working on his truck, appellant told him that a man named "Luis" was going to
hire him (appellant) to kill a fireman for $1,000.00.  Later, appellant told Hoogstra that he "had done
it" and to watch for it on the news.  When Hoogstra learned that Nandin, a fireman, was missing, he
questioned appellant about the matter.  Appellant told Hoosgstra that "they" (appellant Bell and Luis
Ramirez) had lured Nandin to a location on Tennyson Road to service a washer and dryer; that
"they" put a gun to Nandin's head and placed handcuffs on Nandin; and that "they" blew Nandin's
brains out with a shotgun and buried Nandin's body behind a chicken house.  Appellant explained
that the ground was "real hard," Nandin was a big man, and they had a difficult time in burying the
body.  Hoogstra recalled that appellant "giggled" when relating that "they" blew the fireman's brains
out.  While appellant did not specifically say who fired the shots, he later told Hoogstra that Luis
Ramirez had pulled the trigger.  Appellant explained that he and Luis had done this to Nandin
because the fireman was seeing Luis's wife, or Luis was seeing the fireman's wife, "one way or the
other."
	Appellant also told Hoogstra that after the burial, he put on gloves and drove
Nandin's pick-up truck back to San Angelo and parked it at the rear of the old Wal-Mart store on
North Bryant.  Appellant left the washer and dryer in the truck, but threw away Nandin's cell phone
and pager.  Later, appellant gave Hoogstra a pair of handcuffs which he said had been used on
Nandin.  After appellant left for Tyler, Hoogstra gave the handcuffs to the police.  These handcuffs
were shown to be the same brand of handcuffs purchased by Luis Ramirez in 1991 in Las Vegas,
Nevada, where Ramirez worked briefly as a security guard.
	On April 14 or 15, 1998, Hoogstra went with Lee Westerman to do construction work
on a lake house in Brownwood.  Hoogstra told Westerman of his conversation with appellant. 
Westerman had Hoogstra call Crime Stoppers from Brownwood.  Either that day or another in April
when Westerman brought Hoogstra home, Westerman met appellant.  Appellant told Westerman that
the police had been at Hoogstra's home that day, and he did not know whether it was because of a
fight with his girlfriend, or whether it was for the "other thing" that would "get him either life or
death in prison."
	Lisa McDowell, appellant's girlfriend, related that early on the morning of April 8,
1998, she and appellant had gone to the Riordons' home on Tennyson Road to pick up some clothes
they had left behind when they moved.  After the Riordons went to work, she got into an argument
with appellant.  She left him behind and took her infant son and drove to her aunt's house in San
Angelo.  That afternoon, Luis Ramirez dropped appellant off at the aunt's house.  Appellant and
McDowell then drove to the Miles High School to pick up the Riordon children from school as
McDowell had promised.  On the way, McDowell observed appellant throw a latex glove or gloves
out of the car window.  Sometime later, McDowell returned to this particular stretch of highway with
police officers.  A latex glove was found as well as the keys to Nandin's pick-up truck.
	On April 16, 1998, appellant and McDowell left San Angelo for Tyler.  He
supposedly had a construction job in the area.  Appellant had $200 which he told McDowell had
been given to him by Luis Ramirez.  Appellant was arrested in a trailer park near Whitehouse, south
of Tyler.  Appellant and McDowell both signed consent forms giving the officers permission to
search the Mercury Cougar automobile in which they had traveled.  In the search, the officers found
appellant's wallet near the front seat.  In it were two business cards of Luis Ramirez, and a
handwritten note containing directions to two residences in Austin and descriptions of three motor
vehicles.  According to Dawn Ramirez Holquin, Ramirez's ex-wife, the note was in Luis Ramirez's
handwriting and the residences and vehicles described belonged to her and her uncle.
	In the trunk of the searched automobile, a pair of Bugle Boy jeans were found.  After
testing, it was determined that the DNA from the blood stains on the jeans matched the DNA of the
deceased, Nemecio Nandin.  Ginger Herring, Luis Ramirez's girlfriend, testified that Ramirez owned
a pair of Bugle Boy jeans.  McDowell testified that when she and appellant were throwing things into
a trash dumpster before leaving San Angelo, she found the jeans in the trunk of the car, that they
were not appellant's, but he would not let her throw them away.
	A search of the Riordon house uncovered three shotguns--two twenty-gauge
shotguns and one sixteen-gauge shotgun.  Lana Riordan testified that the two twenty-gauge shotguns
were in working order, but not the sixteen-gauge shotgun.  She related that appellant and McDowell
had arrived at her house early on the morning of April 8, 1998, and when she returned that evening
one of the twenty-gauge shotguns had been moved from its regular place and left in another room.
	After his arrest, appellant wrote a letter to McDowell from the Tom Green County
jail.  McDowell kept the letter two months before revealing it to a friend.  The letter was introduced
into evidence describing, inter alia, how Nandin was killed by Ramirez in appellant's presence, how
the body was buried, how he was given money by Ramirez which had been taken out of Nandin's
wallet, and how he drove Nandin's truck to the Wal-Mart store.  Appellant relied upon some of the
self-serving statements in the letter introduced by the State to support his defense of duress. 
Appellant offered no defensive testimony.

Jury Charge--Parties
	In submitting the case to the jury, the trial court inter alia, instructed the jury
abstractly on the law of parties.  In paragraph 4, an application paragraph, the trial court charged the
jury on capital murder in accordance with the allegations of the indictment.  Then separating the
paragraph with an "OR," the trial court applied the law of parties to the capital murder.  In paragraph
5, the trial court likewise submitted the lesser included offense of murder in the same fashion.  The
trial court also charged the jury on the affirmative defense of duress.

Legal Sufficiency
	In his first point of error, appellant contends that the evidence is legally insufficient
to support the capital murder conviction because (1) the evidence is legally insufficient to show that
"he was the triggerman," and (2) insufficient to show his guilt as a party "because there was no
evidence that the principal, Luis Ramirez, committed the murder for remuneration."  By his
expressed contention, appellant challenges only the legal sufficiency of the evidence.

The Standard of Review
	The standard for reviewing the legal sufficiency of evidence is whether, viewing the
evidence in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, any rational trier of fact could have found
beyond a reasonable doubt all the essential elements of the offense charged.  Jackson v. Virginia, 443
U.S. 307, 319 (1979); Skillern v. State, 890 S.W.2d 849, 879 (Tex. App.--Austin 1994, pet. ref'd). 
The standard of review is the same in both direct and circumstantial evidence cases.  King v. State,
895 S.W.2d 701, 703 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995); Green v. State, 840 S.W.2d 394, 401 (Tex. Crim.
App. 1992).  The State may prove its case by circumstantial evidence if it proves all of the elements
of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt.  Easley v. State, 986 S.W.2d 264, 271 (Tex.
App.--San Antonio 1998, no pet.) (citing Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319).  The sufficiency of the evidence
is determined from the cumulative effect of all the evidence; each fact in isolation need not establish
the guilt of the accused.  Alexander v. State, 740 S.W.2d 749, 758 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987).  It is
important to remember that all the evidence the jury was permitted, properly or improperly, to
consider must be taken into account in determining the legal sufficiency of the evidence.  Garcia v.
State, 919 S.W.2d 370, 378 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994); Johnson v. State, 871 S.W.2d 183, 186 (Tex.
Crim. App. 1993); Rodriguez v. State, 939 S.W.2d 211, 218 (Tex. App.--Austin 1997, no pet.).
	The jury is the exclusive judge of the facts proved, the weight to be given the
testimony, and the credibility of the witnesses.  See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.04 (West
1979); Alvarado v. State, 912 S.W.2d 199, 207 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995); Adelman v. State, 828
S.W.2d 418, 421 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992).  The jury is free to accept or reject any or all of the
evidence presented by either party.  Saxton v. State, 804 S.W.2d 910, 914 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991). 
The jury maintains the power to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.  Welch
v. State, 993 S.W.2d 690, 693 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1999, no pet.); Hernandez v. State, 939
S.W.2d 692, 693 (Tex. App.--Fort Worth 1997, pet. ref'd).  Moreover, the reconciliation of
evidentiary conflicts is solely within the province of the jury.  Heiselbetz v. State, 906 S.W.2d 500,
504 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995).
	Under the Jackson standard, the reviewing court is not to position itself as a thirteenth
juror in assessing the evidence.  Rather, it is to position itself as a final due process safeguard
insuring only the rationality of the fact finder.  Moreno v. State, 755 S.W.2d 866, 867 (Tex. Crim.
App. 1988).  It is not the reviewing court's duty to disregard, realign, or weigh the evidence.  Id.  The
jury's verdict must stand unless it is found to be irrational or unsupported by more than a "mere
modicum" of evidence, with such evidence being viewed in the Jackson light.  Id.  The legal
sufficiency of the evidence is a question of law.  McCoy v. State, 932 S.W.2d 720, 724 (Tex.
App.--Fort Worth 1996, pet. ref'd).

Law of Parties
	"A person is criminally responsible as a party to an offense if the offense is committed
by his own conduct, by the conduct of another for which he is criminally responsible, or by both." 
Tex. Pen. Code Ann. § 7.01(a) (West 1994); Goff v. State, 931 S.W.2d 537, 544 (Tex. Crim. App.
1996).  Thus, under the law of parties, the State is able to enlarge a defendant's criminal
responsibility to acts in which he may not be the primary actor.  Tex. Pen. Code Ann. § 7.01(b)
(West 1994); Rome v. State, 568 S.W.2d 298, 300 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997) (op. on reh'g); Rosillo
v. State, 953 S.W.2d 808, 812 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi 1997, pet. ref'd).  The law of parties may
be applied even though no such allegation is contained in the indictment.  Jackson v. State, 898
S.W.2d 896, 898 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995); Montoya v. State, 810 S.W.2d 160, 165 (Tex. Crim. App.
1989);  Pitts v. State, 569 S.W.2d 898, 900 (Tex. Crim. App. 1978); Howard v. State, 966 S.W.2d
821, 824 (Tex. App.--Austin 1998, pet. ref'd).
	Section 7.02 of the Texas Penal Code provides in pertinent part:


	a person is criminally responsible for an offense committed by the conduct of
another if

 
	* * * 


		acting with intent to promote or assist the commission of the offense, he
solicits encourages, directs, aids, or attempts to aid the other person to
commit the offense.


Tex. Pen. Code Ann. § 7.02(a)(3) (West 1994).
	The test for determining when an instruction should be submitted to the jury on the
law of parties was set forth in McCuin v. State, 505 S.W.2d 827, 830 (Tex. Crim. App. 1974), and
quoted in Goff, 931 S.W.2d at 544-45.  It need not be restated here.  When the evidence is sufficient
to support both the primary actor and party theories of liability, as in the instant case, the trial court
does not err in submitting an instruction on the law of parties.  Ransom v. State, 920 S.W.2d 288,
302 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994); Webb v. State, 760 S.W.2d 263, 267, 275 (Tex. Crim. App. 1988);
Rosillo, 953 S.W.2d at 814.  Evidence is sufficient to convict under the law of parties if the
defendant is physically present at the commission of the offense and encourages its commission by
words or other agreement.  Ransom, 920 S.W.2d at 302; Rosillo, 953 S.W.2d at 814.  Clearly, there
was more evidence here than encouragement by appellant Bell so as to constitute him a party, if in
fact Luis Ramirez was the primary actor.
	The trial court submitted the theory to the jury that appellant was the primary actor
in killing Nandin for remuneration as alleged in the indictment.  In the alternative, the trial court
submitted the theory of parties if the jury found that Luis Ramirez was the primary actor and that
appellant for remuneration aided Ramirez in the killing.
	The jury returned a general verdict--"We, the jury find the defendant EDWARD
BELL, guilty of CAPITAL MURDER as charged in the indictment."
	Appellant argues, however, that the evidence is insufficient to show that he was the
primary actor as alleged.  Appellant told Hoogstra that he had been hired to kill a fireman for $1,000. 
He later told Hoogstra that "he (appellant) had done it" and to watch the news.  Still later, appellant
told Hoogstra that "they" had lured Nandin to the location of the killing, "they" had handcuffed
Nandin, and "they" had blown Nandin's brains out with a shotgun.  Nandin died from two shotgun
blasts, one of which was a twenty-gauge shotgun.  The medical examiner, because of the body's
condition, could not determine what type of shotgun inflicted the other wound.  Two twenty-gauge
shotguns in working condition were found at the location of the murder.  The medical examiner was
unable to determine if the same shotgun was used to inflict both wounds.  The deadly blasts could
have been fired from separate shotguns, one by appellant and one by Ramirez, or could have been
fired by the same shotgun.  The jury as the trier of fact could have found that appellant was a primary
actor.  In fact, the jury could have found from the evidence that appellant and Ramirez were both
primary actors.  It was only later that appellant told Hoogstra that Ramirez pulled the trigger.  This
fact was reiterated in appellant's jail letter to McDowell.  The jury was not required to accept this
evidence that Ramirez was the lone gunman.  Given all the circumstances, we reject appellant's
claim that the evidence was insufficient for a rational jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that
appellant was a primary actor in this capital murder.
	Appellant also urges that if the evidence was sufficient to show that he was a party
to the offense for remuneration, the evidence is insufficient to show that he was guilty of capital
murder.  Appellant argues that this is so because the indictment's allegation of an aggravating
element making murder a capital offense was remuneration or the promise of remuneration.
	Appellant contends that the primary actor was Ramirez and that the court's charge
did not require the jury to find that Ramirez murdered Nandin for remuneration or the promise of
remuneration, and that without that requirement and a finding by the jury, the offense was not a
capital offense.  Therefore, appellant asserts that if he is guilty as a party to the offense, it is not a
capital offense of which he is guilty and that the conviction imposed cannot stand.  Appellant
overlooks the law of parties and the fact that section 19.03(a)(3) provides that a person who commits
murder and "commits the murder for remuneration or the promise of remuneration or employs
another to commit the murder for remuneration or the promise of remuneration" is guilty of capital
murder.  Tex. Pen. Code Ann. § 19.03(a)(3) (West 1994). (Emphasis added.)  We do not understand
appellant to challenge the remuneration issue.  In this regard, appellant cites no authorities and there
is no argument except that inherent in his assertion.  This briefing fails to comply with Rule 38.1(h)
of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure.
	When different theories are submitted to the jury in the disjunctive as in the instant
case, a general verdict is sufficient if the evidence supports one of the theories.  Fuller v. State, 827
S.W.2d 919, 931 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992); Kitchens v. State, 823 S.W.2d 256, 257-58 (Tex. Crim.
App. 1991); see also Ladd v. State, 3 S.W.3d 547, 557 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999); Rabbani v. State,
847 S.W.2d 555, 558-59 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995).  We conclude that a rational jury could have found
beyond a reasonable doubt all the essential elements of the offense charged under either of the two
theories submitted to the jury.  The first point of error is overruled.

Jury Charge Error Claimed
	In his second point of error, appellant contends that the "trial court committed
reversible error by overruling appellant's objection to the application paragraph of the charge."  In
his brief, appellant directs us to the application of the law of parties to the facts in the second part
of paragraph 4 of the jury charge.  Appellant, in his trial objection, contended that the State was not
entitled to a charge on the law of parties, that appellant was entitled to a "straight up" charge--"he
either did capital murder or he did not, under this indictment."  Appellant's argument was that he
was charged with capital murder for remuneration or promise of remuneration and that Luis
Ramirez, the primary actor in any parties charge, was not shown to have committed murder for
remuneration or promise of remuneration.  Therefore, appellant contends that he could not be a party
to the offense committed by Ramirez.  This is the same contention that appellant advanced in his
challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.  Murder is defined in section 19.02(b)(1).  Tex. Pen.
Code Ann. § 19.02(b)(1) (West 1994).  Murder becomes capital murder if it is committed under
certain circumstances, limited and set forth in section 19.03.  Id. § 19.03.  Appellant was charged
under section 19.03(a)(3) which provides that murder becomes a capital offense if "the person
commits the murder for remuneration or promise of remuneration or employs another to commit the
murder for remuneration of promise of remuneration."  (Emphasis added.)  As noted earlier, the law
of parties may be applied even without any parties allegation in the indictment.  Pitts, 569 S.W.2d
at 900.  There was evidence that Ramirez employed appellant to murder Nandin for remuneration
or promise of remuneration, thus indicating his guilt under the very same subsection of section 19.03
under which appellant was charged.  In addition, the evidence shows Ramirez was a primary actor
in the murder of Nandin along with his hired help--appellant.	Appellant cites no authorities
supporting his contention (2) and his argument is of little persuasion.  We find no error in the trial
court's action in overruling the objection to the jury charge.  The second point of error is overruled.

The Note
	In the third point of error, appellant contends that the "trial court erred in admitting
into evidence an extraneous offense or bad act, in violation of Rule 403 of the Rules of Evidence." 
Despite the language, appellant presents an issue under Rule 403, not Rule 404(b). (3)  Appellant has
reference to the introduction of a handwritten note found in appellant's wallet during the search of
the Mercury Cougar automobile in east Texas when appellant was arrested.
	Before the jury, Jack Allen, Special Investigator of the Texas Department of Public
Safety, identified the note on a yellow piece of paper and two business cards of Luis Ramirez as
being found in the wallet.  When the State sought to introduce the note into evidence during the re-direct examination of Dawn Ramirez Holquin, a hearing in the absence of the jury was conducted. 
The trial court overruled appellant's Rule 403 objection and his subsequently urged Rule 404(b)
objection.
	Appellant complains that the introduction of the note "permitted the jury to speculate
about an unaccomplished extraneous offense, the murder of Luis Ramirez's ex-wife."  Appellant
relies upon the note and a threat made by Ramirez to his ex-wife, Dawn.  Appellant concedes,
however, that the note is relevant evidence. (4)
  He argues that in light of Rule 403 the note's probative
value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and the needless presentation of cumulative
evidence.
	The note in question, which was in the handwriting of Ramirez according to Dawn,
gave highway directions from Brady to Austin and further directions to two different street addresses
in Austin and a general description of three motor vehicles.  Dawn testified that the street addresses
were those of her home and her uncle's home.  Two of the vehicles described belonged to Dawn's
uncle and the other was hers.
	Dawn had earlier testified that Ramirez had told her it drove him crazy to think of her
with another man, and that if he found her with another man that he would kill him "and come after
her."
	Rule 403 provides:

	Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially
outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading
the jury, or by consideration of undue delay, or needless presentation of cumulative
evidence.


Tex. R. Evid. 403

The factors listed in Rule 403 are the only ones to be balanced against probative
value.  The absence of "such as" or a similar introductory phrase indicates that the
listed factors are not merely examples.  The first three factors--unfair prejudice,
confusion and misleading--are termed "dangers," whereas delay and cumulativeness
are referred to as "considerations."  The former are weightier because they threaten
the integrity of the fact-finding process, whereas the latter are concerned with
efficiency.


2A Steven Goode, et al., Texas Practice: Courtroom Handbook on Texas Evidence 283 (2001 ed.).
	Rule 401 defines "relevant evidence."  Tex. R. Evid 401. (5)  Rule 402 pronounces all
relevant evidence admissible unless barred by certain constitutional and statutory provisions.  Tex.
R. Evid. 402.  Rule 403 places discretion in the trial court to temper somewhat the breadth of Rule
402.  The trial court is authorized to weigh the probative value of relevant evidence against the
countervailing dangers and considerations set forth in Rule 403.  Rule 403 favors the admissibility
of evidence in close cases in keeping with the presumptions of admissibility of relevant evidence. 
Moreno v. State, 22 S.W.3d 482, 487 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999) (quoting Montgomery, 810 S.W.2d
at 389); Mozon v. State, 991 S.W.2d 841, 847 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999).  The standard of review of
a trial court's decision under Rule 403 is an abuse of discretion.  The trial court's ruling will be
upheld so long as it is within "the zone of reasonable disagreement."  Lane v. State, 933 S.W.2d 504,
520 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996); see also Moreno, 22 S.W.3d at 487; Poole v. State, 974 S.W.2d 892,
897 (Tex. App.--Austin 1998, pet. ref'd).

Unfair Prejudice
	We turn now to appellant's claim that the probative value of the note was
substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.  Any evidence presented by the
prosecution will generally be prejudicial to the defendant in a criminal case.  Wyatt v. State, 25
S.W.3d 18, 26 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000); Ford v. State, 26 S.W.3d 669, 675 (Tex. App.--Corpus
Christi 2000, no pet.). "In one sense, almost every piece of evidence introduced at trial can be said
to be prejudicial to one side or the other."  Blakeney v. State, 911 S.W.2d 508, 516 (Tex.
App.--Austin 1995, no pet.).  Consequently, only evidence that is unfairly prejudicial is excluded. 
Cabellero v. State, 919 S.W.2d 919, 922 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1996, pet. ref'd);
Blakeney, 911 S.W.2d at 516.  Unfair evidence is that evidence which has an undue tendency to
suggest a decision be made on an improper basis, commonly an emotional one.  Montgomery, 810
S.W.2d at 389; Ford, 919 S.W.2d at 922.
	Appellant contends that the note in Ramirez's handwriting and found in appellant's
possession, when taken with Ramirez's threat to Dawn, could have caused the jury to speculate a
second conspiracy was afoot.  Thus, the introduction of the note resulted in unfair prejudice.  The
note was not signed and not dated.  It was not addressed to anyone.  Dawn moved to Austin in
December 1997.  She testified that Ramirez had visitation rights with their children and he had
returned them to Austin one weekend.  Dawn related that Nandin visited her in Austin the last
weekend in March 1998 before his death on April 8, 1998.  The time of the threat against all of
Dawn's boyfriends was not established, but it was apparently after the Ramirez divorce in 1995.
	Appellant urges that we apply the four-pronged relevance criteria set forth in
Montgomery, 810 S.W.2d at 389-91, for determining whether the probative value of an extraneous
offense is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.  Appellant overlooks the fact
that the introduction of the note, even taken together with the earlier threat by Ramirez, does not
constitute an extraneous offense by appellant Bell (6) to which the relevance criteria would apply. (7)
	The probative value of the note found in appellant's wallet with Ramirez's business
cards was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.

Cumulative Evidence
	Unlike the "danger" of unfair prejudice, the "consideration" of the needless
presentation of cumulative evidence found in Rule 403 is concerned with the efficiency of judicial
proceedings rather than the threat of inaccurate decisions.  See Alvarado v. State, 912 S.W.2d 199,
212-13 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998).  "Cumulativeness" alone is not a basis for the exclusion of evidence
under Rule 403.  The rule speaks to the "needless presentation" of such evidence.  In this regard, trial
courts should be sensitive to a party's "right" to make its case in the most persuasive manner
possible.  Etheridge v. State, 903 S.W.2d 1, 20-21 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994); see also generally 1
Steven Goode, et al., Texas Practice: Texas' Rules of Evidence: Civil and Criminal § 403.2 (1993).
	Cumulative evidence suggests that other evidence on the same point has already been
received.  But this alone is not a basis for exclusion.  The cumulative effect of the evidence may
heighten rather than reduce its probative value.  Further, evidence that may be cumulative as to one
point may not have that characteristic as to another material point.  Goode, § 403.2.
	In this "murder for hire scenario", the State bore the burden of proof beyond a
reasonable doubt and the link between appellant and Ramirez was of vital importance.  The strongest
evidence of a link came from Hoogstra and appellant's jail letter introduced by the State.  Appellant
impeached and discredited Hoogstra by showing, inter alia, that Hoogstra had received hundreds of
dollars from several law enforcement agencies early on in the investigation.  Appellant also used
statements in his jail letter to support his defense of duress.  If it can be argued that appellant's
possession of the note written by Ramirez was cumulative evidence of the link between the two, it
was not inadmissible on the basis of needless presentation of cumulative basis.  Moreover, the State
urges that the note was admissible to rebut the defense of duress.
	We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling appellant's
Rule 403 objection.  The third point of error is overruled.
	The judgment is affirmed.

refused to admit the testimony of Ginger Herring, Ramirez's girlfriend to the effect that she
overheard Ramirez and appellant talking about going to Austin and killing Ramirez's ex-wife, her

                                   I. Standard of Review

        When reviewing Commerce's antidumping determinations under 19 U.S.C.

§ 1516a(a)(2)(B)(iii) and 28 U.S.C. § 1581(c), the U.S. Court of International Trade

sustains Commerce's “determinations, findings, or conclusions” unless they are

“unsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with

law.”   19 U.S.C. § 1516a(b)(1)(B)(i).     More specifically, when reviewing agency

determinations, findings, or conclusions for substantial evidence, the court assesses

whether the agency action is reasonable given the record as a whole. Nippon Steel

Corp. v. United States, 458 F.3d 1345, 1350-51 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Substantial evidence

has been described as "such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as

adequate to support a conclusion." Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 229

(1938). Substantial evidence has also been described as "something less than the

weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from

the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency's finding from being supported

by substantial evidence." Consolo v. Fed. Mar. Comm'n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).

Fundamentally, though, "substantial evidence" is best understood as a word formula

connoting reasonableness review.     3 Charles H. Koch, Jr., Administrative Law and

Practice § 9.24[1] (3d. ed. 2013). Therefore, when addressing a substantial evidence

issue raised by a party, the court analyzes whether the challenged agency action "was

reasonable given the circumstances presented by the whole record." Edward D. Re,

Bernard J. Babb, and Susan M. Koplin, 8 West's Fed. Forms, National Courts § 13342

(2d ed. 2013).

      Separately, the two-step framework provided in Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural

Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-45 (1984), governs judicial review of

Commerce's interpretation of the antidumping statute. See United States v. Eurodif

S.A., 555 U.S. 305, 316 (2009) (Commerce's "interpretation governs in the absence of

unambiguous statutory language to the contrary or unreasonable resolution of language

that is ambiguous.").

                                       II. Discussion

                           A. Financial Statement Selection

      Commerce’s selection of financial statements to calculate the financial ratios for

respondents’ margins is an oft-litigated issue in non-market economy antidumping

cases. Commerce is guided by a general regulatory preference for publicly available,

non-proprietary information.   19 C.F.R. § 351.408(c)(1), (4) (2009).     Beyond that,

Commerce generally considers the quality, specificity, and contemporaneity of the

available financial statements. See Fresh Garlic from the People's Republic of China,
Consol. Court No. 11-00106                                                            Page 5

67 Fed. Reg. 72,139 (Dep't of Commerce Dec. 4, 2002) (final results new shipper

review).

        During the administrative review, Commerce had a choice from among four

Indian financial statements: ‘06-‘07 Infiniti Modules Private Ltd. (“Infiniti Modules”); ‘08-

‘09 Omax Autos Ltd. (“Omax”); and ‘07-‘08 and ‘08-‘09 Maximaa Systems Ltd.

(“Maximaa”). In the Final Results Commerce chose the ‘06-‘07 Infiniti Modules’ financial

statements alone as the best available information from which to calculate the financial

ratios. Foshan Shunde and Since Hardware challenged this decision, arguing that the

statements were not publicly available and that Omax’s and Maximaa’s financial

statements represented the best available information to calculate the financial ratios.

Since Hardware Mot. for J. upon the Agency R., ECF No. 43 (SH 56.2 Br.”); Foshan

Shunde Mot. for J. upon the Agency R., ECF No. 44 (FS 56.2 Br.”).                In its initial

consideration of the issue, the court agreed that Commerce’s choice may not have been

reasonable and remanded for Commerce to “reconsider[] the issue of the public

availability of the Infiniti Modules financial statement, . . . [and to] review and reconsider

whether the more contemporaneous statements of Omax or Maximaa might be useful

additional data points, either in place of, or in addition to, Infiniti Modules.”       Since

Hardware at 6. On remand Commerce again solely selected the ‘06-‘07 Infiniti Modules’

financial statements and found them to be publicly available. See Remand Results at

7,15.
Consol. Court No. 11-00106                                                      Page 6

                                 1. Public Availability

      When first reviewing the issue of the public availability of the ‘06-‘07 Infiniti

Modules’ financial statements, the court could not sustain Commerce’s determination as

reasonable. Since Hardware at 6. Although Commerce found that the statements were

available through the Indian Ministry of Corporate Affairs’ (“MCA”) website, Decision

Memorandum at 10, there was more than a “fair amount of record information

demonstrating that the Infiniti Modules financial statements may not have been publicly

available[,]” as evidenced by Since Hardware and Foshan Shunde’s unsuccessful

attempts to obtain the financial statements or other Infiniti Modules’ financial

information. Since Hardware at 4.

      On remand Commerce acknowledges that it erred in the Final Results when it

concluded that the Infiniti Modules’ financial statements were available through the MCA

website; they are not. Remand Results at 7. Commerce nevertheless clarifies that it

still believes they are publicly available. Id. at 29. In the Remand Results Commerce

reasons that the Infiniti Modules’ financial statements are publicly available because

they were used in a prior administrative review and available on the public

administrative record of that review are publicly available.    Id. at 29.   Commerce

explains that Commerce and all interested parties have significant experience with

Infiniti Modules as a surrogate company.       Id. at 5-6.   In each of the four prior

administrative reviews, Commerce calculated financial ratios using a single year of

Infiniti Modules’ financial statements. See Floor-Standing, Metal-Top Ironing Tables

Republic of China, 75 Fed. Reg. 55,759 (Sept. 14, 2010) (prelim. results 4th admin.

review) (selected Infiniti Modules’ ‘05-‘06 statement). In prior administrative reviews

both Since Hardware and Foshan Shunde accepted Infiniti Modules’ financial

statements as publicly available and argued about the specific substantive application of

the financial statements:

               Specifically, Infiniti Modules’ 2006-2007 financial statements were
      obtained by Petitioner and placed on the record of the third administrative
      review along with the 2005-2006 financial statements of Infiniti Modules.
      [Commerce] used the 2006-2007 financial statements of Infiniti Modules in
      the calculations set forth in the final results of the third administrative
      review. More importantly, Since Hardware acknowledged the existence of
      and was given the opportunity to comment on both Infiniti Modules’ 2005-
      2006 and Infiniti Modules’ 2006-2007 financial statements in that review.
      Specifically, during that review, Since Hardware asserted that regardless
      of whether [Commerce] selected the 2005-2006 financial statements of
      Infiniti Modules or the 2006-2007 financial statements of Infiniti Modules,
      [Commerce] should make certain adjustments to the financial ratios
      derived from those financial statements. Similarly, Foshan Shunde
      engaged in argument over certain aspects of using Infiniti’s financial
      statements in the fourth administrative review, though it did not dispute
      that the information was publicly available.
Consol. Court No. 11-00106                                                          Page 8

Remand Results at 5-6 (citations omitted). Noting that its regulatory preference for

publicly available information addresses “the concern that a lack of transparency about

the source of the data could lead to proposed data sources that lack integrity or

reliability,” Commerce found that nothing had “transpired to undermine the integrity or

reliability” of the ‘06-‘07 Infiniti Modules’ financial statements. Id. at 6.

       This though is not really a determination of “public availability” made against

measurable objective criteria. It is instead a determination that the Infiniti Modules’ data

remains among the best available information because of its reliability (notwithstanding

that it may not be publicly available). The court understands Commerce’s desire to use

information with which it is familiar from a surrogate company that it knows well. It

makes good, practical, efficient sense. The ‘06-‘07 Infiniti Modules’ financial statements

were apparently obtained directly from the company by petitioner, Home Products

International, Inc. (“HPI”), in the third administrative review. The public availability of

that document was not challenged. Financial statements from Infiniti Modules were also

used in the fourth administrative review, and again the public availability of that data

was not challenged.       In both instances respondents accepted the data and made

substantive arguments about its proper use. Commerce and the interested parties have

invested significant time and energy over the course of the prior reviews vetting and

refining the Infiniti Modules’ financial statements for use in the financial ratio

calculations. The court fully understands Commerce’s reluctance to abandon otherwise

reliable data on a technicality that it has become publicly unavailable (or perhaps never

was when measured against objective criteria).
Consol. Court No. 11-00106                                                          Page 9

       The court, though, cannot sustain Commerce’s determination that these financial

statements are publicly available. In the Remand Results Commerce cites to Catfish

Farmers of Am. v. United States, 33 CIT ___, ___, 641 F. Supp. 2d 1362, 1377 (2009),

as an example of “the standard for public availability established in our practice.”

Remand Results at 29. One searches Catfish Farmers in vain for an explanation of the

“standard for public availability established in [Commerce’s] practice.” Remand Results

at 29. That explanation does not appear in Catfish Farmers because it did not involve

Commerce’s administrative practice for determining public availability. Instead, Catfish

Farmers involved a challenge to Commerce’s use of a proprietary auditors’ report to

supplement a publicly available financial statement. Catfish Farmers, 33 CIT at ___,

641 F. Supp. 2d at 1377. Unlike here, Commerce did not determine that the proprietary

auditors’ report was publicly available.    Commerce, instead reasoned that because

everyone had fair and open access to it during the proceeding, it was appropriate to

supplement an otherwise publicly available financial statement as among the best

available information. Id. The court, in turn, sustained as reasonable Commerce’s use

of the non-public, confidential, auditors’ report to supplement a publicly available

financial statement. Id.

       Further, Catfish Farmers does not identify or explain Commerce’s standards or

criteria for public availability. Instead, it more modestly demonstrates that Commerce’s

regulatory preference for public availability is not absolute, offering an instance in which

Commerce’s use of proprietary surrogate information was reasonable. Catfish Farmers

does not provide support for Commerce’s conclusion that the Infiniti Modules’ financial
Consol. Court No. 11-00106                                                       Page 10

statements are publicly available.    Catfish Farmers would instead appear to lend

support for the conclusion that although the ‘06-‘07 financial statements are no longer

publicly available, they may still merit consideration as among the best available

information to calculate surrogate financial ratios because all parties had full and fair

access to otherwise reliable data.

      As for the missing public availability criteria necessary to evaluate Commerce’s

decision here, Foshan Shunde directs the court to another administrative proceeding,

contemporaneous with the Remand Results, where Commerce applied what appears to

be fairly rigorous standards for public availability. See Yantai Xinke Steel Structure Co.

v. United States, Court No. 10-00240, Final Results of Redetermination Pursuant to

Court Remand, ECF No. 83 at 18-23 (“Steel Grating Remand Results”); see also

Certain Steel Grating from the People’s Republic of China, 75 Fed. Reg. 32,366 (Dep’t

of Commerce June 8, 2010) (final LTFV determ.). In that proceeding Commerce

      sought clarification by issuing a supplemental questionnaire. . . . In this
      supplemental questionnaire, the Department requested that Petitioners
      provide a detailed step-by-step explanation of how they obtained
      Greatweld’s 2008-09 financial statements, and that the steps provided
      should be of sufficient detail so that any party would be able to replicate
      these steps to acquire Greatweld’s 2008-09 financial statements. If such
      a step-by-step explanation could not be provided, the Department
      requested that Petitioners provide a detailed explanation of why they could
      not provide such information. In addition, the Department also asked
      Petitioners to provide a detailed explanation as to the reason they
      believed Greatweld’s 2008-09 financial statements were properly
      described as publicly available and, in providing their response, to indicate
      if Greatweld was required under Indian law to publicly file its 2008-09
      financial statements with any governmental authority.
Consol. Court No. 11-00106                                                       Page 11

Steel Grating Remand Results at 19-20. Petitioners there provided the step-by-step

process of obtaining the “1) annual return; 2) balance sheet; 3) schedules; 4) auditor’s

report; 5) director’s report; and 6) notice,” but did not provide the step-by-step process

of receiving the income statements.       Commerce determined Greatweld’s financial

statements were not publicly available “[b]ecause the other interested parties to the

proceeding, as well as the Department itself, do not know the steps necessary to

acquire Greatweld’s 2008-09 income statement, and, therefore, could not acquire that

data themselves . . . .” Id. at 22.

       In contrast, Commerce here was satisfied that Infiniti Modules’ statements were

publicly available because “Petitioner was able to get them directly from the company

simply by requesting them,” Remand Results at 7, even though respondents were

apparently unsuccessful with similar requests.        Under the standards Commerce

enunciated in the Steel Grating Remand Results, respondents’ inability to obtain the

data from the same source and in the same manner does seem to establish that Infiniti

Modules’ statements are now publicly unavailable. In the Remand Results Commerce

casts a skeptical eye on respondents’ efforts to obtain the data from Infiniti Modules,

noting that respondents never specifically requested the ‘06-‘07 data. Id. at 6-7. The

court was somewhat surprised by this interpretation of the record. Although it may be

technically correct, the court was under the impression that the record made clear that

respondents had made a good faith effort to obtain general financial information from

Infiniti Modules (including more contemporaneous financial statements), but were

completely rebuffed, which then instigated their arguments about public availability.
Consol. Court No. 11-00106                                                           Page 12

       The court will remand the issue of public availability for Commerce to reconcile

its approach here with the Steel Grating Remand Results, as well as to reconsider its

determination in light of the court’s explanation of Catfish Farmers.           Commerce’s

determination that Infiniti Modules financial statements are publicly available remains

unreasonable (unsupported by substantial evidence), and therefore cannot be

sustained.

                              2. Other Financial Statements

       In Since Hardware the court also remanded for Commerce to “review and

reconsider whether the more contemporaneous statements of Omax or Maximaa might

be useful additional points, either in place of, or in addition to, Infinit[i] Modules” and to

“explain its choices in this administrative review against the choices made in Folding

Metal Tables and Chairs . . . .” Since Hardware at 6. On remand Commerce again

selected the ’06-’07 Infiniti Modules’ financial statements. Since Hardware and Foshan

Shunde argue that Commerce’s selection was unreasonable and that it should have

selected Omax or Maximaa. As previously discussed, Infiniti Modules’ data has certain

advantages. It has been used in every review under the order, and Commerce and the

parties know it well. The ‘06-‘07 Infiniti Modules’ financial statements, however, are less

contemporaneous than the other choices, and have this nagging problem with public

availability. The court, for its part, remains unconvinced that Commerce’s sole selection

of the ’06-’07 Infiniti Modules’ financial statements alone is a reasonable choice on this

administrative record.
Consol. Court No. 11-00106                                                      Page 13

                                         a. Maximaa

      Compared to the ‘06-‘07 Infiniti Modules financial statements, the ‘07-‘08

Maximaa financial statements are more contemporaneous, and the ‘08-‘09 Maximaa

financial statements cover the exact period of review. Unlike Infiniti Modules’ financial

statements, Maximaa’s public availability is not in dispute. Commerce, nevertheless,

continues to reject Maximaa’s financial statements for the following reasons:

      We . . . dispute Foshan Shunde’s assertion that Maximaa’s financial
      statements represent the best available information. Foshan Shunde
      argues that the Department’s selection of Maximaa’s financial statements
      in Folding Metal Tables and Chairs undercuts the rejection of Maximaa’s
      2007-2008 financial statements in the instant proceeding. However, in the
      proceeding at issue in this remand, the Department declined to use the
      2008 and 2009 financial statements of Maximaa based on record
      evidence that was submitted by interested parties on the record of
      this case, not the record of the case Foshan cites. The record
      evidence in this proceeding is separate and distinct from the information
      that comprised the record in Folding Metal Tables and Chairs and relates
      to a different product. Necessarily, our comments about the nature of
      financial statements in that case were made in the context of comparing
      them to folding metal tables and chairs, not ironing tables. In Folding
      Metal Tables and Chairs, we based our selection of Maximaa on the fact
      that, based on the evidence in that proceeding, “a greater proportion
      of Maximaa’s production appears to consist of comparable
      merchandise (i.e., metal furniture),” and “because it has a similar
      production process to that of the respondent.” The record in this
      case does not support the same conclusions. Rather, Maximaa’s
      business activities and production processes do not resemble that
      of respondent in this case and with respect to this product. . . .[T]he
      Department’s review of the information submitted by Petitioner concerning
      Maximaa’s financial statements indicated that Maximaa had increasingly
      become an assembler rather than a manufacturer of the
      merchandise. Thus, notwithstanding the conclusion reached in
      Folding Tables and Chairs that Maximaa was an integrated producer
      of steel furniture, we continue to maintain that facts on the record in this
      case demonstrate that the use of Maximaa’s financial statements
      inappropriate in this proceeding.
Consol. Court No. 11-00106                                                     Page 14

Remand Results at 12-13 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).

      Commerce fails to reasonably distinguish its financial statement selection here

from its financial statement selection in Folding Metal Tables and Chairs from the

People’s Republic of China, 74 Fed. Reg. 68,568 (Dep’t of Commerce Dec. 28, 2009)

(final results admin. review) (“Folding Metal Tables and Chairs”); see also Issues and

Decision Memorandum for Folding Metal Tables and Chairs from China, A-570-868

(Dec. 18, 2009), available at http://ia.ita.doc.gov/frn/summary/prc/E9-30695-1.pdf (last

visited this date) (“FMTC Decision Memorandum”). Folding Metal Tables and Chairs

involved merchandise similar to metal ironing boards and a choice among similar

financial statements, Maximaa’s ‘07-‘08 and Infiniti Modules’ ‘06-‘07. In that review,

Commerce selected the Maximaa financial statement because it found that Maximaa

produced a greater proportion of comparable merchandise--metal furniture--than Infiniti

Modules, and because Maximaa was an integrated producer while Infiniti was an

assembler. FMTC Decision Memorandum at 4-5.

      Commerce distinguished Folding Metal Tables and Chairs by explaining that, in

this review, Maximaa had “increasingly become an assembler.” Remand Results at 13.

Commerce rejected Maximaa’s financial statement because of this critical finding. Id.

However, Infiniti Modules was “evermore a 100% assembler.” FS Remand Br. at 10.

Therefore, the court does not understand the basis for rejecting Maximaa’s financial

statements because it was becoming an assembler, while accepting the financial

statements of Infiniti Modules, who was an assembler. The simple fact is that both were
Consol. Court No. 11-00106                                                          Page 15

assemblers. Commerce’s distinction appears to be one without a difference, and is

accordingly unreasonable.

       Turning to Commerce’s remaining criteria for selecting the best available

information, Maximaa remains more contemporaneous, has more comparable metal

merchandise, and its public availability is not in dispute. On this administrative record, it

is difficult to imagine a reasonable mind concluding that Maximaa’s financial statement

is not at least as useful, if not better, than the Infiniti Modules data. Further, Commerce

has a "preference . . . to use more than one financial statement where more than one

representative financial statement is available.” Remand Results at 14. The court,

therefore, remands this issue to Commerce to reconsider its financial statement

selection.

                                         b. Omax

       Since Hardware and Foshan Shunde argue that Commerce also unreasonably

excluded the ‘08-‘09 Omax financial statements.         In selecting financial statements,

Commerce is driven by a statutory preference for selecting financial statements from

producers of comparable merchandise. 19 U.S.C. § 1677b(c)(4)(B); see also 19 C.F.R.

§ 351.408(c)(4) (“For manufacturing overhead, general expenses, and profit, the

Secretary normally will use non-proprietary information gathered from producers of

identical or comparable merchandise in the surrogate country.”). In the final results

Commerce declined to use Omax’s financial statements because it determined that

Omax was primarily an auto producer and therefore not an appropriate surrogate. Final

Results; see Decision Memorandum at 10-11. Respondents challenged Commerce’s
Consol. Court No. 11-00106                                                       Page 16

findings and argued that they had supplied evidence of Omax’s production of home

furnishings. The court, therefore, directed Commerce to address the evidence of Omax

as a manufacturer and supplier of ironing tables. Since Hardware at 6.

          On remand, Commerce determined that Omax was not a producer of ironing

tables:

          [T]here is no record evidence that suggests Omax sold ironing tables to
          either Ikea or Polder during either the POR or the period covered by
          Omax’s 2008-2009 annual report. We thus conclude that while Omax
          may have been in a position to supply ironing tables to Polder subsequent
          to the end of the POR, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that
          Omax was a producer of ironing tables during the POR.

Remand Results at 12. This finding is unreasonable on an administrative record in

which the Omax ‘08-‘09 financial statements actually contain a picture of an ironing

table. Id. at 31. Although Commerce tries to explain the picture away, id. at 31, the

court is not persuaded that a company not producing ironing tables would include a

picture of an ironing table in its financial statements as a representative product.

Additionally, Polder, Inc., a company that imported ironing tables from Omax, stated in a

letter that Omax “has supplied global behemoth Ikea with ironing tables and other steel

housewares for the last two years.” Since Hardware SV Submission, PD 98, App. 1 at

1-2 (emphasis added).3 Because Polder’s letter was dated, October 15, 2010, the “last

two years” references October 2008 through October 2010. Id. This period overlaps

this 2008-2009 administrative review. Therefore, Commerce unreasonably concluded

that “there is no record evidence that suggests Omax sold ironing tables to either Ikea

    “PD” refers to a document in the public administrative record.
Consol. Court No. 11-00106                                                      Page 17

or Polder during the POR or the period covered by Omax’s 2008-2009 annual report.”

Remand Results at 12.

      This error though is ultimately harmless because Commerce’s overall decision to

exclude the Omax financial statements remains reasonable. The administrative record

supports Commerce’s determination that Omax is not a suitable surrogate because it is

primarily an auto producer:

      . . . [T]he record in this case establishes that during the period of review
      (POR), Omax’s principle business comprised automotive products.
      Ironing tables constituted, at most, a very small portion of Omax’s
      business during Omax’s 2008-2009 financial reporting period.

               As a fundamental matter, Omax’s 2008-2009 annual report
      establishes that during the 2008-2009 fiscal reporting period, Omax was
      principally a manufacturer of automobile parts. First, we note that Omax’s
      official name is “Omax Autos Limited.” More importantly, we note that at
      page 13 of its financial statements, Omax lists 29 of its customers. Of
      those 29 customers, only one customer (Ikea) seems to be involved in
      the business that Omax describes as “home furnishings.” The rest of the
      customers listed by Omax in that section of the report appear to be
      involved in the automotive business based upon a simple examination of
      the company names. The importance of the automotive business to
      Omax is further highlighted in the account from Jatender Mehta, the
      Managing Director of Omax, which can be found in Omax’s 2008-2009
      annual report . . . . In that account, Mr. Mehta discusses Omax’s financial
      performance during the fiscal year. In discussing the challenges that
      Omax faced during the 2008-2009 fiscal reporting period, Mr. Mehta cites
      to a decline from “World Giants like GM, Chrysler and Ford.” Mr.
      Mahta[sic] also notes a downturn that was experienced by Toyota.
      While Mr. Mehta indicates elsewhere in this account that Omax intends to
      expand the company’s “product profile to Home Furnishings, Commercial
      Vehicles and the Indian Railway,” Mr. Mehta merely indicates that
      “[I]nvestments for creating manufacturing facilities have been earmarked.”
      However, Omax’s “foray” into the home furnishings business, is primarily
      described as a business segment from which Omax expects to derive
      future, rather than current, business. Mr. Mehta discusses no specific
      sales volume for “home furnishings” during the POR. Additionally, Mr.
      Mehta indicates that;
Consol. Court No. 11-00106                                                     Page 18


             . . . the company has made a foray into the Home
             Furnishings segment. The strategy has been to tie up with
             the biggest international brand—Ikea. This would include
             the desired level of quality, delivery and cost awareness
             within the Company. The company has started exports of
             various items under the division. We are putting up a new
             10 Acre plant facility at Bawai Haryana. This plant will be
             operational in the 3rd quarter of FY 09-10.

               From our review of the customers identified by Omax, in its 2008-
       2009 Annual Report, and the account of Omax’s business that is set forth
       by Mr. Mehta, we continue to conclude that Omax’s primary business
       during the period captured by its 2008-2009 financial statements was
       the production of automotive products.
                                               ***
       Because automotive products are less similar to ironing tables than is
       furniture, we conclude that data from Infiniti Modules represents a higher
       quality of data within the meaning of section 773(c)(l) of the Act.

Id. at 10-12 (emphasis added). Commerce, therefore, determined Omax was primarily

an auto producer based on its name, customers, and the statements of its Managing

Director.

       The name of the company, Omax Autos Limited, pretty much says it all.          It

communicates that the company is primarily involved in the automotive business.

Similarly, all but one of Omax’s 29 customers is in the automotive business. Admittedly,

that one customer in the home furnishings business is the “global behemoth” Ikea.

Since Hardware SV Submission, PD 98 at App. 1. And although that does count for

something, a reasonable mind could conclude on this administrative record that Omax

concentrates the bulk of its operations on the automotive sector and is therefore not a

suitable surrogate for the general financial ratio calculations of a metal ironing board
Consol. Court No. 11-00106                                                 Page 19

manufacturer. Accordingly, the court must sustain Commerce’s decision to exclude the

Omax financial statements.

                                 B. Brokerage and Handling

       In the final results Commerce determined the World Bank’s Doing Business

2010: India is “the best available source for valuing Foshan Shunde's brokerage and

handling expenses.” Final Results; see Decision Memorandum at cmt. 3. Commerce

used the World Bank data to calculate Foshan Shunde and Since Hardware’s

brokerage and handling (“B&H”) expenses based on their respective container sizes.

Id. Foshan Shunde challenged Commerce’s reliance on the World Bank data and the

specific B&H calculations. Commerce requested a voluntary remand to correct Foshan

Shunde’s container weight and to address Foshan Shunde’s requested letter of credit

deduction. The court granted Commerce’s voluntary request for remand and further

remanded the issue for Commerce to (1) prepare a clear and complete public summary

of its calculations of Foshan Shunde’s B&H expense; (2) explain why its chosen

surrogate data source and calculation is reasonably the best choice by comparing the

advantages and disadvantages of each; and (3) respond to Foshan Shunde’s

arguments with respect to Commerce adjusting Foshan Shunde’s actual shipped weight

and actual shipping mode. Since Hardware at 8-9.

       On remand Commerce affirmed its selection of the World Bank data and its B&H

calculation.   Remand Results at 15-22, Attach. 1.    Commerce also detailed the

mechanics of its calculation for public summary:
Consol. Court No. 11-00106                                                    Page 20

      This details [Commerce’s] calculation of brokerage and handling expense.
      In Doing Business India, total brokerage and handling expenses are listed
      as follows: [See Doing Business in India - Doing Business - The World
      Bank Group (Doing Business India—2010) at 37 and 84; see also HPI
      November 15, 2010 Case Brief at 17-18.]

            1) Document Preparation:                        $350
            2) Customs Clearance and technical control      $120
            3) Ports and Terminal Handling                  $175

            Total charges                                   $645

      Moreover, as noted in the Doing Business India—2010 study, the
      container size assumed in the study is for a 20 foot full container load.
      However, both Since Hardware and Foshan Shunde shipped in 40 foot
      containers. Therefore, using the formulae set forth, we estimated the
      shipment weight that would be incurred in a 20 foot container as follows:
      [This calculation is also explained at HPI November 15, 2010 Case Brief
      at 17-18.]

      D= (A*B)/C

      E= $645/D

      A represents the cubic capacity of a 20 foot container which is 33 cubic
      meters

      B represents the weight of product shipped in 40 foot containers which is
      { } kg of product

      C represents the cubic capacity of a 40 foot container (the size in which
      both respondents shipped merchandise) which is 67.3.

      D represents the estimated weight of product shipped in 20 foot containers

      E represents the calculated, per kilogram amount for brokerage and
      handling.

      In this case D yields an estimated weight of {     } kilograms for product
      shipped in a 20 foot container

      D= 33*{ }/67.3= { }.
Consol. Court No. 11-00106                                                       Page 21

      Therefore, to derive the { } per unit brokerage and handling amount
      utilized in the Final Results, we divided the total brokerage and handling
      amount of $645 by the { } estimated weight of product shipped in 20 foot
      containers.

      E=$645/{ }={ }

      Public Summary of Calculation

      This calculation can also be illustrated publicly through the use of
      hypothetical numbers. In this hypothetical example, we continue to
      allocate the total pool of brokerage and handling expenses ($645) from
      the Doing Business India—2010 study. We assume that this respondent
      shipped in a 40 foot container. We, thus adjust the calculated shipment
      weight for this hypothetical respondent to adjust for shipments in a 20 foot
      container instead of in a 40 foot container. We also continue to assume
      the same cubic capacity for both the 20 foot and 40 foot containers that
      we utilized in the Final Results of this review.

      In our hypothetical example, we assume that the respondent shipped
      5000 kg of product in a 40 foot container. In such an instance

      A (the cubic capacity of a 20 foot container) would continue to equal 33
      cubic meters.

      B (the weight of product shipped in 40 foot container) would equal 5000
      kilograms.

      C (the cubic capacity of a 40 foot container) would continue to equal 67.3
      cubic meters.

      D represents the estimated weight of product shipped in 20 foot container
      which would be

      D= 33*5000/67.3= 2,451.71

      E represents the calculated, per kilogram amount for brokerage and
      handling which would equal $0.2631 or

      E= $645/2451.71=.2631

Consol. Court No. 11-00106                                                      Page 22

      [W]e have determined that brokerage and handling expenses were
      properly calculated in the Final Results for the following reasons. The
      Department’s practice when selecting the best available information for
      valuing FOPs, in accordance with section 773(c)(1) of the Act, is to select
      surrogate values which are product-specific, representative of a broad-
      market average, publicly available, contemporaneous with the POR, and
      free of taxes and duties. The Doing Business 2010: India data from the
      World Bank reflect the experience of a broad number of companies, are
      publicly available, specific to the costs in question, represent a broad
      market average, and are contemporaneous to the POR.
                                          ***
             [T]he Department has utilized such World Bank data in a number of
      cases including Wooden Bedroom Furniture from the People’s Republic of
      China, Stainless Steel Sinks from China, and Wooden Bedroom Furniture
      from the People‘s Republic of China, consistently finding the World Bank
      data to be a reliable and accurate source of surrogate value information.
      World Bank data represent a reputable source of information for valuing
      brokerage and handling because those data are prepared by an
      independent organization and are based upon a survey derived from a
      broad number of producers. In contrast, the import data offered by
      Foshan Shunde were limited to two freight forwarders (Samsora[sic] and
      Hapang[sic] Lloyd). While Foshan Shunde has argued that the import
      data of Samsora and Hapang[sic] Lloyd also relate somehow to exports,
      the facts on the record of this proceeding do not substantiate the
      quantification of any such export experience. As previously noted, the
      business of exporting is fundamentally different than the business of
      importing and the data from these activities cannot be considered
      interchangeable.

             Further, the data provided by Foshan Shunde to link brokerage and
      handling expenses to Foshan Shunde’s specific business situation fail to
      substantiate its claims with regard to the expenses associated with the
      preparation of letters of credit. As Petitioner has demonstrated, the World
      Bank data upon which the Department relied constituted $350 and are
      comprised of eight items: 1) bill of lading, 2) certificate of origin, 3)
      commercial invoice, 4) custom’s export declaration, 5) inspection report, 6)
      packing list, 7) technical standard/health certificate, and 8) terminal
      handling receipts. Nowhere in this schedule of eight items are letter of
      credit expenses mentioned. More to the point, . . .Foshan Shunde has
      claimed a constructed letter of credit cost of $390 which exceeds the
      total amount of brokerage and handling expenses calculated by the
      World Bank. Applying the $390 letter of credit expense, to the $350
      of charges set forth in the Doing Business report would thus result
Consol. Court No. 11-00106                                                      Page 23

      in the nonsensical calculation of a negative expense amount for
      Foshan Shunde’s brokerage and handling expenses. . . . .

             Foshan Shunde’s fails to substantiate its assertions that as a
      “rational producer” it would never incur expenses as high as those
      enumerated in the Doing Business report or that distance from seaport is
      a determining factor in brokerage and handling expenses. As Petitioner
      has noted, because “inland transportation and handling” are
      calculated elsewhere in NV calculations, distance from a seaport is
      an irrelevant factor for purposes of calculating brokerage and
      handling expenses. These expenses are by definition incurred at the
      port of export.
                                            ***
      . . . While Foshan Shunde asserts that exporters close to a seaport
      incur lower brokerage and handling costs than do inland
      manufacturers, there is no evidence on the record that permits the
      Department to quantify that suggested difference. Similarly, there is
      no information on the record of this proceeding that would permit the
      Department to tailor any publicly-available surrogate value data to the
      specific business situation experienced by Foshan Shunde or to remove
      elements of brokerage and handling expense which Foshan Shunde
      claims not to have incurred. . . . Foshan Shunde’s claim that it does not
      incur letter of credit expenses invites an inquiry that is beyond the scope
      of the issue here. The relevant question is whether the World Bank data
      are a reliable source for general brokerage and handling expenses, not
      whether the World Bank report reflects Foshan Shunde’s line-by-line
      experience. . . . Without knowing the exact breakdown of the data
      included in the World Bank report, the Department can no more
      deduct a letter of credit expense than add extra expenses which
      Foshan Shunde incurred but are not reflected by the World Bank
      data. In other words, the averaged data in the World Bank report is a
      reasonable surrogate value because a line-by-line analysis is simply not
      possible. . . . .

             Foshan Shunde has also challenged the Department’s adjustment
      from the 40 foot container size in which it shipped to the 20 foot container
      sizes that are reflected in the Doing Business 2010: India data. This issue
      was also reviewed by the Court in Dongguan Sunrise. . . . In sustaining
      the Department’s conversion from a 40 foot to a 20 foot container size, the
      Court rejected Fairmont’s argument indicating:

            This argument fails because Fairmont has not presented
            evidence that brokerage costs are based on value, not
Consol. Court No. 11-00106                                                       Page 24

             volume, and do not increase proportionately with the number
             of cubic feet.

              The methodology employed in this review is consistent with that
      employed in Dongguan Sunrise.            Foshan Shunde has failed to
      demonstrate which, if any, of the costs included within the Doing Business
      2010: India data do not increase proportionately with volume.
      Accordingly, . . . we continue to maintain that our adjustment for container
      size is supported by record evidence in this proceeding.

Remand Results at 17-21, 38-40 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).

      Foshan       Shunde   first   argues   that   Commerce’s   B&H    calculations   are

unreasonable because Commerce should not have relied on the World Bank data but

should have instead used the data from Indian freight forwarders: Samsara and Hapag-

Lloyd. FS Remand Br. at 11-20. Foshan Shunde challenges the World Bank data as

not reflecting the experience of any Indian producers at all, but being based on a survey

completed by “[l]ocal freight forwarders, shipping lines, customs brokers, port officials,

and banks.” Id. at 13 (citing Foshan Shunde SV Submission for Final Results, PD 96 at

Ex. 6). Foshan Shunde adds that Commerce is generally reluctant to use the results of

a survey as source documentation when “none of the actual responses or data collected

from these questionnaires were provided in the report” and that therefore, Commerce

“had no way to evaluate whether the information collected in the questionnaire

responses was complete or properly analyzed, much less whether the responses can

be considered representative . . . .” Id. at 13 (quoting Fresh Garlic from China, 77 Fed.

Reg. 34,346 (Dep’t of Commerce June 11, 2012) (final results admin. review)). The

court disagrees.
Consol. Court No. 11-00106                                                      Page 25

      Commerce explained that its practice when selecting the best available

information for valuing factors of production, in accordance with 19 U.S.C.

§ 1677b(c)(1), is to “select surrogate values which are product-specific, representative

of a broad-market average, publicly available, contemporaneous . . . and free of taxes

and duties.” Remand Results at 17-18 (citing Certain Polyester Staple Fiber from the

People’s Republic of China, 75 Fed. Reg. 1336 (Dep’t of Commerce Jan. 11, 2010)

(final results admin. review). Accordingly, Commerce calculated Foshan Shunde’s B&H

costs using the World Bank’s Doing Business 2010: India which “reflect[s] the

experience of a broad number of companies, [is] publicly available, specific to the costs

in question, represent a broad market average, and are contemporaneous.” Remand

Results at 17-18.    In contrast, Foshan Shunde's data are limited to two sources,

Samsara and Hapag-Lloyd.       Commerce explained that while the World Bank data

largely satisfy Commerce's surrogate value criteria, Foshan Shunde's two sources are

deficient in several respects. See id. at 18-19. First, they fail to represent a broad

market average because they are from only two companies. Id. at 18. Second, the

experience of two freight forwarders is not specific to the expenses in question because

the expenses reported in these data sources represent import expenses—not export

expenses. Id. at 19 ("[T]here is no documentation on the record of this proceeding to

suggest that the costs for importing merchandise parallel the costs that are related to

exporting merchandise."). Commerce further explained that “the business of exporting

is fundamentally different than the business of importing and the data from these

activities cannot be considered interchangeable.”     Id. at 39.   In response, Foshan
Consol. Court No. 11-00106                                                      Page 26

Shunde contends that Commerce’s finding “is simply incorrect” and that it submitted

“prices for all port activities – for both importers and exporters.” FS Remand Br. at 16.

However, the Samsara and Hapag-Lloyd data that Foshan Shunde submitted are both

labeled as import data. See Foshan Shunde SV Submission for Prelim. Results, PD 77

at Ex. 2. Further, when arguing that it submitted export data, Foshan Shunde cites to its

submission of the Indian port schedules, Foshan Shunde SV Submission for Prelim.

Results, PD 77 Ex. 1, and not the Samsara and Hapag-Lloyd data, Foshan Shunde SV

Submission for Prelim. Results, PD 77 Ex. 2.         Therefore, Commerce reasonably

concluded that the Samsara and Hapag-Lloyd data reflect only import data.           See

Foshan Shunde SV Submission for Prelim. Results, PD 77 at Ex. 2.

      Additionally, although Foshan Shunde claims that consistent with Commerce

practice, Commerce “must reject the World Bank Doing Business Report as

unrepresentative, unreliable, and unverifiable,” FS Remand Br. at 13, Commerce

reasonably found the World Bank data to be a “reliable and accurate source.” Remand

Results at 38. Commerce explained that the “World Bank data represent a reputable

source of information for valuing brokerage and handling because those data are

prepared by an independent organization and are based upon a survey derived from a

broad number of producers.” Id. at 38-39. Commerce has also previously relied on the

World Bank data to calculate surrogate B&H values.         See e.g., Wooden Bedroom

Furniture from the People’s Republic of China, 76 Fed. Reg. 9,747 (Dep’t of Commerce

Feb. 22, 2011) (new shipper review final results); Drawn Stainless Steel Sinks from the

People’s Republic of China, 78 Fed. Reg. 13,019 (Dep’t of Commerce Feb. 26, 2013)
Consol. Court No. 11-00106                                                       Page 27

(final results admin. review); Wooden Bedroom Furniture from the People’s Republic of

China, 75 Fed. Reg. 50,992 (Dep’t of Commerce Aug. 18, 2010) (final results admin.

review); see also Dongguan Sunrise Furniture Co. v. United States, 36 CIT ___, ___,

865 F. Supp. 2d 1216, 1246 (2012) (affirming Commerce’s reliance on the World Bank

data and noting that “Commerce has consistently found the World Bank to be a reliable

source for data”). Therefore, Commerce reasonably relied on the World Bank data.

      Foshan Shunde next argues that Commerce should have altered the World Bank

data to reflect Foshan Shunde’s actual expenses. FS Remand Br. at 12. First, Foshan

Shunde argues that Commerce should remove a specific expense from the aggregate

data, specifically, the expense for preparing a letter of credit. Id. at 17. Foshan Shunde

contends that because it did not incur a letter of credit expense, Commerce should

adjust the B&H by deducting amounts for letter of credit expenses. Id. at 17. Foshan

Shunde explains that “the World Bank data includes costs for procuring an export letter

of credit,” id. at 17, and that “the L/C costs are embedded in the “documents required to

export and import” and greatly inflate the document preparation costs.” FS 56.2 Br. at

Ex. 1, 31. Foshan Shunde lists the price of an export letter of credit as $390. FS

Remand Br. at 17 (citing FS’ Br. 56.2 at 26). Commerce, however, responds that it will

not adjust the B&H because the listed items composing the B&H do not include a letter

of credit expense. Remand Results at 39 (“Nowhere in this schedule of eight items are

letter of credit expenses mentioned.”).     Moreover, Defendant argues that Foshan

Shunde’s $390 letter of credit cost “exceeds [$350,] the total amount of [the document

preparation costs of the] brokerage and handling expenses calculated by the World
Consol. Court No. 11-00106                                                        Page 28

Bank. Applying the $390 letter of credit expense, to the $350 . . . charges . . . would

result in the nonsensical calculation of a negative expense.” Id. at 39 (citations omitted)

(original emphasis).

       The B&H costs from the Word Bank data are composed of three categories of

expenses: (1) document preparation; (2) customs clearance and technical control; and

(3) ports and terminal handling. Id. at Attach. 1. The document preparation fee is

composed of eight items: (1) bill of lading; (2) certificate of origin; (3) commercial

invoice; (4) custom's export declaration; (5) inspection report; (6) packing list;

(7) technical standard/health certificate; and (8) terminal handling receipts. Id. at 39.

Letters of credit are not included in the eight listed expenses for document preparation.

Even if the letter of credit expenses are embedded, as Foshan Shunde argues, the

court agrees that, "without knowing the exact breakdown of the data included in the

World Bank Report, [Commerce] can no more deduct a letter of credit expense than add

extra expenses which Foshan Shunde incurred but are not reflected by the World Bank

data." Id. at 19-20. Therefore, Commerce's refusal to adjust the B&H costs for possible

letter of credit expenses was reasonable.

       Next, Foshan Shunde argues that Commerce should have adjusted its B&H

calculations to reflect Foshan Shunde’s proximity to China’s seaports. Foshan Shunde

argues that “proximity to a major seaport is a key factor in the World Bank’s

determination of the cost of trading across borders in India” and that companies near

ports bear lower B&H expenses. FS 56.2 Br. at Ex. 1, 28; FS Remand Br. at 16.

Commerce responds that “because ‘inland transportation and handling’ are calculated
Consol. Court No. 11-00106                                                       Page 29

elsewhere in NV calculations, distance from a seaport is an irrelevant factor for

purposes of calculating brokerage and handling expenses. These expenses are by

definition incurred at the port of export." Remand Results at 40. Commerce further

adds that “[w]hile Foshan Shunde asserts that exporters close to a seaport incur lower

brokerage and handling costs than do inland manufacturers, there is no evidence on the

record that permits [Commerce] to quantify that suggested difference.” Id. at 19. The

court does not believe this conclusion is reasonable on this administrative record.

      Foshan Shunde placed on the administrative record the World Bank’s Doing

Business Subnational Report that includes the specific B&H costs for Indian seaports:

Chennai, Kochi, Kolkata, and Mumbai.        Foshan Shunde SV Submission for Final

Results, PD 96 at Ex. 4. The data that Commerce relied on, the World Bank’s Doing

Business in India: 2010, is composed of the B&H costs of 17 Indian cities/regions

including the four above mentioned port cities. Id. at Ex. 3-4. Four of the 17 cities are

seaports, and the remaining 13 are inland.        Id. at Ex. 4.    The Doing Business

Subnational Report contains the following categories of expenses for each seaport:

(1) document preparation; (2) customs clearance and technical control; (3) ports and

terminal handling; and (4) inland transportation and handling. Id. Commerce explained

that it did not include inland transportation and handling in its B&H calculations.

Remand Results at 40.       Commerce instead calculated B&H from the other three

categories of costs: (1) document preparation; (2) customs clearance and technical

control; and (3) ports and terminal handling. Id. at Attach. 1. Therefore, in arguing the

proper B&H calculation for each seaport, Foshan Shunde also omitted inland
Consol. Court No. 11-00106                                                      Page 30

transportation and handling costs from the Business Subnational Report data. FS 56.2

Br. at 28.    The Business Subnational Report, excluding inland transportation and

handling fees, provides the following B&H costs for the four seaports: Chennai: $439;

Kochi: $375; Kolkata: $462; and Mumbai $645. Foshan Shunde SV Submission for

Final Results, PD 96 at Ex. 4.; see also id.     The average B&H costs for the four

seaports are $480. In contrast, based on the aggregate data of all 17 cities, Commerce

calculated $645 in B&H costs. Remand Results at Attach. 1. Therefore, even excluding

inland transportation costs, there is a $165 difference between the combined data for all

17 Indian cities and the data from the seaports.     This evidence directly contradicts

Commerce’s conclusion that “distance from a seaport is an irrelevant factor” and that

there is no evidence to “quantify that suggested difference.” Id. at 19, 40. Further, the

court agrees with Foshan Shunde that Commerce “offered no explanation why the

World Bank report including export costs from 17 Indian cities, most of which lie far

inland, was a more appropriate data set than the regional reports of four Indian cities

geographically located near major ports, when Foshan Shunde itself is located near

major Chinese ports.”      FS 56.2 Br. at 26.      Commerce’s determination appears

unreasonable. The court must therefore remand this issue to Commerce to consider

the World Bank data from the seaports or to provide a reasonable explanation as to why

that is not appropriate.

       Finally, Foshan Shunde argues that Commerce’s adjustment of the World Bank

data from 20-foot to 40-foot containers is unreasonable because B&H costs do not

increase proportionally from 20-foot to 40-foot containers. FS Remand Br. at 19-20.
Consol. Court No. 11-00106                                                      Page 31

Foshan Shunde contends that the per-kilogram B&H costs of a 40-foot container is

lower than that of a 20-foot container. Id. Commerce calculated the B&H costs by first

determining the per-kilogram B&H costs of a 20-foot container, and then applied that

value to the weight of a 40-foot container. This type of calculation assumes that B&H

costs increase proportionally from 20-foot to 40-foot containers. From this calculation,

Commerce determined B&H costs to be $645.              Remand Results at Attach. 1.

Defendant and HPI respond to Foshan Shunde’s argument, explaining that Commerce

“merely converted the data, such that the World Bank data would reflect the ways in

which Foshan Shunde actually ships its goods” and that, “Commerce made a

straightforward mathematical adjustment from the 40-foot container size in which it

shipped to the 20-foot container size that are reflected in the World Bank data.”

Defendant’s Resp. to Plaintiffs’ Comm. Concerning Remand Results, ECF No. 100 at

19-20 (“Def. Remand Br.”); see also Reply of HPI to Comm. Concerning Remand

Results, ECF No. 101 at 19 (“HPI Remand Br.”). Defendant also argues that this same

issue was addressed in Dongguan Sunrise v. United States, 36 CIT ___, ___, 865 F.

Supp. 2d 1216, 1247 (2012), in which the court held Commerce’s conversion from a 20-

foot to a 40-foot container reasonable. Def. Remand Br. at 20. HPI also relies on Utility

Scale Wind Towers from the People's Republic of China, 77 Fed. Reg. 75,992 (Dep’t of

Commerce Dec. 26, 2012) (final determ.), in arguing that total B&H costs increase

proportionally with container capacity. HPI Remand Br. at 19. On remand, Commerce

explained that “Foshan Shunde has failed to demonstrate which, if any, of the costs

included within the Doing Business 2010: India data do not increase proportionately with
Consol. Court No. 11-00106                                                    Page 32

[container size].” Remand Results at 21. Defendant and HPI, therefore, argue that

Commerce’s conversion of the data was reasonable (supported by substantial

evidence).

      In Dongguan Sunrise the court sustained Commerce’s adjustment of the World

Bank data from a 20-foot to a 40-foot container “because [Respondent] ha[d] not

presented evidence that brokerage costs are based on value, not volume, and do not

increase proportionally with the number of cubic feet.” Dongguan Sunrise, 36 CIT at

___, 865 F. Supp. 2d at 1247. Similarly, in Utility Scale Wind Towers from the People's

Republic of China, Commerce stated, “absent record evidence to the contrary, total

brokerage and handling costs increase proportionally with a container’s capacity and,

therefore, per-unit brokerage and handling rates do not change as a container’s

capacity increases.” Utility Scale Wind Towers from the People's Republic of China, 77

Fed. Reg. 75,992, 75,997 (Dep’t of Commerce Dec. 26, 2012) (final determ.) (emphasis

added). If B&H costs increased proportionally from 20-foot to 40-foot containers, as

Commerce calculated, then there would be a 100% increase in B&H costs from a 20-

foot to a 40-foot container. Foshan Shunde, however, points to evidence in the record

that shows only a 30-50% increase in costs from 20-foot to 40-foot containers. Foshan

Shunde SV Submission for Prelim., PD 77, Ex. 1 at 3-6, 14-16, 37, 64-65, Ex. 2; see

also FS 56.2 Br. at 33. Therefore, Foshan Shunde has demonstrated that B&H costs

do not increase proportionally from 20-foot to 40-foot containers.        Accordingly,

Commerce unreasonably concluded that, “Foshan Shunde has failed to demonstrate,

which if any, of the costs . . . do not increase proportionately with volume.” Remand
Consol. Court No. 11-00106                                                        Page 33

Results at 21.    The court remands this issue to Commerce to consider Foshan

Shunde’s evidence regarding B&H costs in 20-foot versus 40-foot containers.

                        C. Cotton Fabric Surrogate Valuation

      In Since Hardware the court granted Commerce’s voluntary remand request to

reconsider Since Hardware’s cotton fabric weight and recalculate the conversion factor.

Since Hardware at 2. On remand, Commerce changed the conversion factor from 5.0

to 7.5 and explained:

      Since Hardware has demonstrated that the weight of its cotton fabric was
      between 100 grams and 200 grams per square meter. The precise
      conversion factor for Since Hardware’s cotton inputs would therefore
      range between 5 and 10. Therefore, based upon the information on
      record, the Department has based its determination on a reasonable
      inference that the conversion factor is 7.5.
Remand Redetermination at 23.       In challenging the cotton fabric conversion factor,

Since Hardware presents a hollow argument.          Since Hardware’s entire argument

consists of the following: “[t]his Court should find that Commerce should use the record

information verified for Since Hardware and apply the 5.49 conversion factor instead of

the 7.5 as it is more specific to Since Hardware Draft Remand Comments at 2-6[sic].”

SH Br. at 20.    Missing is any effort to develop an argument as to how the 5.49

conversion factor is “more specific to Since Hardware” and to identify standards against

which the court can evaluate the reasonableness of Commerce’s cotton fabric valuation.

Id. Since Hardware’s “argument” is all the more difficult to countenance because the

Scheduling Order specifically cautioned against just such a submission:

      Please be advised that the court will not permit the plaintiff to shift to the
      court and the other parties the burden of establishing the ossature of
      plaintiff’s arguments against the standard of review the court applies to
Consol. Court No. 11-00106                                                        Page 34

       resolve them.    Instead, the court will summarily sustain Commerce’s
       action.

Scheduling Order at 5, ECF No. 36. Rule 56.2(c)(2) requires that briefs "must include

the authorities relied on and the conclusions of law deemed warranted by the

authorities." USCIT R. 56.2(c)(2). As Since Hardware has failed to satisfy this basic

requirement, and abide by the express instructions of the Scheduling Order, the court

deems this issue waived and sustains Commerce's cotton fabric surrogate valuation.

See MTZ Polyfilms, Ltd. v. United States, 33 CIT ___, ___, 659 F. Supp. 2d 1303, 1308-

09 (2009); Fujian Lianfu Forestry Co. v. United States, 33 CIT ___, ___, 638 F. Supp.

2d 1325, 1350 (2009); United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990)

("[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at

developed argumentation, are deemed waived. It is not enough merely to mention a

possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to do counsel's work,

create the ossature for the argument, and put flesh on its bones.") (citations omitted).

                       D. Labor Wage Rate Surrogate Valuation

       In the final results Commerce calculated the surrogate labor wage rate using

data from the International Standard Classification of all Economic Activities (“ISIC”)

Revision 3 rather than ISIC Revision 2. Final Results; see Decision Memorandum at

16. The court in Since Hardware remanded the issue to have Commerce conform its

results with the prior review, Home Prods., 36 CIT ___, ___, 837 F. Supp. 2d 1294,

1296-97, and to include Indian data under ISIC Revision 2, as well as any other

appropriate country in that data set. Since Hardware at 9-11. The court rejected Since
Consol. Court No. 11-00106                                                      Page 35

Hardware and Foshan Shunde’s argument that Commerce must use data from India

because “the statute does not mandate Commerce must, as a matter of law, use Indian

data alone.” Since Hardware at 10. The court also deemed waived any argument by

Since Hardware and Foshan Shunde that, as a factual matter, India alone was both

economically comparable to China and a significant producer of comparable

merchandise, because neither party identified even one country included in

Commerce’s analysis that failed either standard, leaving that work to the court or the

other interested parties. Id. Consequently, the court did not “require Defendant or HPI

to expend any more energy on this issue” other than for Commerce to conform its

decision to its Remand Redetermination from the prior administrative review. Id. at 11.

      On remand Commerce followed the court’s instructions and recalculated the

labor wage rate “rely[ing] on labor data reported by countries either under the

International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) Revision 3, or, as discussed

below, ISIC Revision 2,” including “data from India and Nicaragua.” Remand Results at

22-22. Since Hardware again argues that Commerce should have selected India alone

to calculate the surrogate wage rate. SH Br. at 19-20. The court previously rejected

this argument in Since Hardware, and Commerce’s labor wage rate surrogate valuation

is therefore sustained. See Since Hardware at 10-11; see also Home Prods. Int’l, Inc. v.

United States, 36 CIT ___, ___, 810 F. Supp. 2d 1373, 1380 (2012); opinion after

remand, Home Prods. Int’l, Inc. v. United States, 36 CIT ___, ___, 837 F. Supp. 2d

          Accordingly, it is hereby

          ORDERED that Commerce’s financial statement selection is remanded to

reconsider the exclusion of the Maximaa financial statements; it is further

with page limits for comments on the remand results no later than seven days after

Commerce files its remand results with the court.

        UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of these petitions for review of

several Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) decisions, it is

hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED, that the petitions for

review are DENIED.

        Each of these petitions challenges a decision of the BIA

affirming an immigration judge’s (“IJ”) decision denying a

motion to reopen or denying a motion to reopen in the first

instance based on either the movant’s failure to demonstrate

changed country conditions sufficient to avoid the applicable

time       and   numerical    limits      or   the   movant’s   failure    to

demonstrate prima facie eligibility for the underlying relief

sought.          See   8   C.F.R.   §§    1003.2(c),    1003.23(b).       The

applicable standards of review are well-established. See Jian

Hui Shao v. Mukasey, 546 F.3d 138, 168-69 (2d Cir. 2008).


12132010-1-34                            -5-
        Petitioners, all natives and citizens of China, filed

motions         to    reopen     based   on    their    claim    that    they    fear

persecution           because     they    have    one   or   more    children     in

violation of China’s coercive population control program. For

largely the same reasons as this Court set forth in Jian Hui

Shao, 546 F.3d at 158-73, we find no error in the BIA’s

decisions.           While the petitioners in Jian Hui Shao were from

Fujian Province, as are most of the petitioners here, five of

the petitioners2 are from Zhejiang Province.                         As with the

evidence discussed in Jian Hui Shao, which concerned Fujian

Province,            the   evidence      proffered      by   these      petitioners

concerning Zhejiang Province either does not discuss forced

sterilizations or involves isolated incidents of persecution

of     individuals         who    are    not     similarly      situated    to    the

petitioners.           See Jian Hui Shao, 546 F.3d at 160-61, 170-71.

        Some of the petitioners3 argue that the agency applied an

incorrect burden of proof by requiring them to establish more

than their prima facie eligibility for relief.           However, in

those cases, the agency either reasonably relied on their

failure to demonstrate changed country conditions excusing the

untimely filing of their motions, or concluded that they

failed to establish their prima facie eligibility for relief.

See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c), 1003.23(b); see also INS v. Abudu,

485 U.S. 94, 104 (1988).

        Some of the petitioners4 argue that the agency failed to

give sufficient consideration to the statement of Jin Fu Chen,

who alleged that he suffered forcible sterilization after his

return to China based on the births of his two children in

Japan. A prior panel of this Court remanded a petition making

a similar claim so that Jin Fu Chen’s statement (which was

submitted to the BIA after a remand) could be considered by

the IJ.         See Zheng v. Holder, No. 07-3970-ag (2d Cir. Jan. 15,

2010).          Since that remand, the BIA has repeatedly concluded

that Jin Fu Chen’s statement does not support a claim of

changed country conditions or a reasonable possibility of

persecution.         Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in

ag.

12132010-1-34                       -7-
the BIA’s summary consideration of that statement in these

cases.          See Jian Hui Shao, 546 F.3d at 169 (recognizing that

the     Court      has   rejected   the   notion   that   the   agency   must

“expressly parse or refute on the record each individual

argument or piece of evidence offered by the petitioner”); see

also Wei Guang Wang v. BIA, 437 F.3d 270, 275 (2d Cir. 2006)

(providing that the agency may summarily consider evidence

that is “oft-cited” and that it “is asked to consider time and

again”).           We cannot say, furthermore, that the agency’s

conclusions concerning the probative force of the statement

involved any error of law.

        Eight of the petitioners5 argue that the BIA erred by

relying on the U.S. Department of State’s 2007 Profile of

Asylum Claims and Country Conditions in China (“2007 Profile”)

because statements in that document are based on mistranslated

and contradictory evidence.               However, we have repeatedly

concluded, as the BIA did here, that the purportedly corrected

translations do not materially alter the meaning of the 2007

Profile by demonstrating a risk of forced sterilization.                   To

the extent that the BIA declined to credit some of the

petitioners’6         unauthenticated,      individualized   evidence   in

light of an underlying adverse credibility determination, the

BIA did not abuse its discretion.                 See Qin Wen Zheng v.

Gonzales, 500 F.3d 143, 146-47 (2d Cir. 2007).

        Finally, one of the petitioners7 argues that the BIA

violated her right to due process and equal protection of the

law by refusing to reopen her proceedings to file a successive

application for withholding of removal and CAT relief.                  The

petitioner’s equal protection argument is foreclosed by Yuen

Jin v. Mukasey, 538 F.3d 143, 158-59 (2d Cir. 2008).              We find

no merit to petitioner’s due process argument.                 Assuming,

arguendo,         that   petitioner   has    a   protected   interest   in

withholding of removal and CAT relief, we conclude that she

received constitutionally sufficient process when the agency

adjudicated her initial application for relief and provided

her the opportunity to submit evidence in support of two

ROBERT E. FRANCIS, J.S.C.
These are consolidated motions to suppress under the equal protection and due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.[1] Seventeen defendants of African ancestry claim that their arrests on the New Jersey Turnpike south of exit 3 between 1988 and 1991 result from discriminatory enforcement of the traffic laws by the New Jersey State Police.[2] After a lengthy hearing, I find defendants have established a prima facie case of selective enforcement which the State has failed to rebut requiring suppression of all contraband and evidence seized.
Defendants base their claim of institutional racism primarily on statistics. During discovery, each side created a database of all stops and arrests by State Police members patrolling the Turnpike between exits 1 and 7A out of the Moorestown Station for thirty-five randomly selected days between April 1988 and May 1991 from arrest reports, patrol charts, radio logs and traffic tickets. The databases are essentially the same. Both sides counted 3060 stops which the State found to include 1212 race identified stops (39.6%), the defense 1146 (37.4%).
To establish a standard against which to compare the stop data, the defense conducted a traffic survey and a violator survey. Dr. John Lamberth, Chairman of the Psychology Department at Temple University who I found is qualified as an expert in statistics and social psychology, designed both surveys.
The traffic survey was conducted over twenty-one randomly selected two and one-half hour sessions between June 11 and June 24, 1993 and between 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. at four sites, two northbound and two southbound, between exits 1 and 3 of the Turnpike. Teams supervised by Fred Last, Esq., of the Office of the Public Defender observed and recorded the number of vehicles that passed them except for large trucks, tractortrailers, buses and government vehicles, how many contained a "black" occupant and the state of origin of each vehicle. Of the 42,706 vehicles counted, 13.5% had a black occupant. Dr. Lamberth testified that this percentage is consistent with the 1990 Census figures for the eleven states from where almost 90% of the observed vehicles were registered. He said it is also consistent with a study done by the Triangle Group for the U.S. Department of Transportation with which he was familiar.
The violator survey was conducted over ten sessions in four days in July 1993 by Mr. Last traveling between exits 1 and 3 in his vehicle at sixty miles per hour on cruise control after the speedometer had been calibrated and observing and recording the number of vehicles that passed him, the number of vehicles he passed and how many had a black occupant. Mr. Last counted a total of 2096 vehicles other than large trucks, tractortrailers, buses and government vehicles of which 2062 or 98.1% passed him going in excess of sixty miles per hour including 306 with a black occupant equaling about 15% of those vehicles clearly speeding. Multiple violators, that is those violating the speed limit and *353 committing some other moving violation like tailgating, also equaled about 15% black. Dr. Lamberth testified that the difference between the percentage of black violators and the percentage of black travelers from the surveys is statistically insignificant and that there is no evidence traffic patterns changed between the period April 1988 to May 1991 in the databases and JuneJuly 1993 when the surveys were done.
Using 13.5% as the standard or benchmark against which to compare the stop data, Dr. Lamberth found that 127 or 46.2% of the race identified stops between exits 1 and 3 were of blacks constituting an absolute disparity of 32.7%, a comparative disparity of 242% (32.7% divided by 13.5%) and 16.35 standard deviations. By convention, something is considered statistically significant if it would occur by chance fewer than five times in a hundred (over two standard deviations). In case I were to determine that the appropriate stop data for comparison with the standard is the stop data for the entire portion of the Turnpike patrolled by the Moorestown Station in recognition of the fact that the same troopers patrol between exits 3 and 7A as patrol between exits 1 and 3, Dr. Lamberth found that 408 or 35.6% of the race identified stops between exits 1 and 7A were of blacks constituting an absolute disparity of 22.1%, a comparative disparity of 164% and 22.1 standard deviations.[3] He opined it is highly unlikely such statistics could have occurred randomly or by chance.[4]
Defendants also presented the testimony of Dr. Joseph B. Kadane, an eminently qualified statistician. Among his many credentials, Dr. Kadane is a full professor of statistics and social sciences at Carnegie Mellon University, headed the Department of Statistics there between 1972 and 1981 and is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, having served on its board of directors and a number of its committees and held various editorships on its Journal. Dr. Kadane testified that in his opinion both the traffic and violator surveys were well designed, carefully performed and statistically reliable for analysis. From the surveys and the defense database, he calculated that a black was 4.85 times as likely as a white to be stopped between exits 1 and 3. This calculation led him to "suspect" a racially non-neutral stopping policy. While he noted that the surveys were done in 1993 and compared to data from 1988 to 1991, he was nevertheless satisfied that the comparisons were useable and accurate within a few percent. He was not concerned that the violator survey failed to count cars going less than sixty miles per hour and travelling behind Mr. Last when he started a session. He was concerned, however, with the fact that only 37.4% of the stops in the defense database were race identified.[5] In order to determine if the comparisons were sensitive to the missing racial data, he did *354 calculations performed on the log odds of being stopped. Whether he assumed the probability of having one's race recorded if black and stopped is the same as if white and stopped or two or three times as likely, the log odds were still greater than.99 that blacks were stopped at higher rates than whites on the Turnpike between exits 1 and 3 during the period April 1988 to May 1991. He therefore concluded that the comparisons were not sensitive to the missing racial data.
Supposing that the disproportionate stopping of blacks was related to police discretion, the defense studied the traffic tickets issued by State Police members between exits 1 and 7A on the thirty-five randomly selected days broken down by State Police unit.[6] There are 533 racially identified tickets in the databases issued by either the now disbanded Radar Unit, the Tactical Patrol Unit or general road troopers ("Patrol Unit"). The testimony indicates that the Radar Unit focused mainly on speeders using a radar van and chase cars and exercised limited discretion regarding which vehicles to stop. The Tac-Pac concentrates on traffic problems at specific locations and exercises somewhat more discretion as regards which vehicles to stop. Responsible to provide general law enforcement, the Patrol Unit exercises by far the most discretion among the three units. From Mr. Last's count, Dr. Lamberth computed that 18% of the tickets issued by the Radar Unit were to blacks, 23.8% of the tickets issued by the Tac-Pac were to blacks while 34.2% of the tickets issued by the Patrol Unit were to blacks. South of exit 3, Dr. Lamberth computed that 19.4% of the tickets issued by the Radar Unit were to blacks, 0.0% of the tickets issued by the Tac-Pac were to blacks while 43.8% of the tickets issued by the Patrol Unit were to blacks. In his opinion, the Radar Unit percentages are statistically consistent with the standard established by the violator survey, but the differences between the Radar Unit and the Patrol Unit between both exits 1 and 3 and 1 and 7A are statistically significant or well in excess of two standard deviations.
The State presented the testimony of Dr. Leonard Cupingood to challenge or refute the statistical evidence offered by the defense. I found Dr. Cupingood is qualified to give expert testimony in the field of statistics based on his Ph.D in statistics from Temple and his work experience with the Center for Forensic Economic Studies, a for profit corporation headquartered in Philadelphia. Dr. Cupingood collaborated with Dr. Bernard Siskin, his superior at the Center for Forensic Economic Studies and a former chairman of the Department of Statistics at Temple.
Dr. Cupingood had no genuine criticism of the defense traffic survey. Rather, he centered his criticism of the defense statistical evidence on the violator survey. Throughout his testimony he maintained that the violator survey failed to capture the relevant data which he opined was the racial mix of those speeders most likely to be stopped or the "tail of the distribution." He even recommended the State authorize him to design a study to collect this data, but the State declined. He was unclear, though, how he would design a study to ascertain in a safe way the vehicle going the fastest above the speed limit at a given time at a given location and the race of its occupants without involving the credibility of State Police members. In any event, his supposition that maybe blacks drive faster than whites above the speed limit was repudiated by all State Police members called by the State who were questioned about it. Colonel Clinton Pagano, Trooper Donald Nemeth, Trooper Stephen Baumann and Detective Timothy Grant each testified that blacks drive indistinguishably from whites. Moreover, *355 Dr. Cupingood acknowledged that he knew of no study indicating that blacks drive worse than whites. Nor could he reconcile the notion with the evidence that 37% of the unticketed stops between exits 1 and 7A in his database were black and 63% of those between exits 1 and 3. Dr. James Fyfe, a criminal justice professor at Temple who the defense called in its rebuttal case and who I found is qualified as an expert in police science and police procedures, also testified that there is nothing in the literature or in his personal experience to support the theory that blacks drive differently from whites.[7]
Convinced in his belief that the defense 15% standard or benchmark was open to question, Dr. Cupingood attempted to find the appropriate benchmark to compare with the databases. He did three studies of presumedly race-blind stops: night stops versus day stops; radar stops versus non-radar stops and drinking driving arrests triggered by calls for service.
In his study of night stops versus day stops, he compared the percentage of stops of blacks at night between exits 1 and 7A in the databases with the percentage of stops of blacks during daytime and found that night stops were 37.3% black versus 30.2% for daytime stops. Since he presumed the State Police generally cannot tell race at night, he concluded the higher percentage for night stops of blacks supported a standard well above 15%. His premise that the State Police generally cannot recognize race at night, however, is belied by the evidence. On July 16, 1994 between 9:40 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. Ahmad S. Corbitt, now an assistant deputy public defender, together with Investigator Minor of the Office of the Public Defender drove on the Turnpike at 55 miles per hour for a while and parked perpendicular to the Turnpike at a rest stop for a while to see if they could make out the races of the occupants of the vehicles they observed. Mr. Corbitt testified that the two could identify blacks versus whites about 80% of the time in the moving mode and close to 100% in the stationary mode. Over and above this proof is the fact the databases establish that the State Police only stopped an average of eight black occupied vehicles per night between exits 1 and 7A. Dr. Cupingood conceded a trooper could probably identify one or two black motorists per night.
Next, in his study of radar stops versus non-radar stops, Dr. Cupingood focused on the race identified tickets where radar was used in the databases and found that 28.5% of them were issued to blacks. Since he assumed that radar is race neutral, he suggested 28 .5% might be the correct standard. As Dr. Kadane said in rebuttal, this study is fundamentally flawed because it assumes what is in question or that the people stopped are the best measure of who is eligible to be stopped. If racial prejudice were afoot, the standard would be tainted. In addition, although a radar device is race-blind, the operator may not be. Of far more significance is the defense study comparing the traffic tickets issued by the Radar, Tac-Pac and Patrol Units which shows again that where radar is used by a unit concerned primarily with speeders and acting with little or no discretion like the Radar Unit, the percentage of tickets issued to blacks is consistent with their percentage on the highway.
*356 And lastly in his effort to find the correct standard, Dr. Cupingood considered a DUI study done by Lieutenant Fred Madden, Administrative Officer of the Records and Identification Section of the State Police. Lt. Madden tabulated DUI arrests between July 1988 and June 1991 statewide, statewide excluding the State Police, for Troop D of the State Police which patrols the entire length of the Turnpike, for Moorestown Station of Troop D and for Moorestown Station south of exit 3 broken down by race and between patrol related versus calls for service (i.e. accidents, motorist aids and other-the arrested motorist coming to the attention of the State Police by a toll-taker or civilian). Since Dr. Cupingood believed DUI arrests from calls for service were race neutral, he adopted the percentage of DUI arrests of blacks for the Moorestown Station from calls for service of 23% as a possible standard. Like his radar versus non-radar stop study, his use of the DUI arrest study is fundamentally flawed because he assumed what is in question. Further, he erred in assuming that DUI arrests from calls for service involve no discretion. While the encounters involve no discretion, the arrests surely do. He admitted that race/discretion may explain the following widespread statistics in the DUI arrest study:


Statewide (all departments)            12% black
Statewide (excluding State
Police)                              10.4% black
State Police                           16% black
Troop D                                23% black
Moorestown Station                     34% black
Moorestown Station patrol related      41% black
Moorestown Station patrol related
south of exit                        3 50% black

After hearing the testimony of Kenneth Ruff and Kenneth Wilson, two former troopers called by the defense who were not reappointed at the end of their terms and who said they were trained and coached to make race based "profile" stops to increase their criminal arrests, the State asked Dr. Cupingood to study the race identified stops in his database and see how many possessed the profile characteristics cited by Ruff and Wilson, particularly how many were young (30 or under), black and male. Dr. Cupingood found that only 11.6% of the race identified stops were of young black males and only 6.6% of all stops were of young black males.
The defense then conducted a profile study of its own. It concentrated on the race identified stops of just blacks issued tickets and found that an adult black male was present in 88% of the cases where the gender of all occupants could be determined and that where gender and age could be determined, a black male 30 or younger was present in 63% of the cases. The defense study is more probative because it does concentrate on just stops of blacks issued tickets eliminating misleading comparisons with totals including whites or whites and a 62.6% group of race unknowns. Neither side, of course, could consider whether the blacks stopped and not issued tickets possessed profile characteristics since the databases contain no information about them.
Dr. Cupingood's so-called Mantel-Haentzel analysis ended the statistical evidence. He put forward this calculation of "expected black tickets" in an attempt to disprove the defense study showing the Patrol Unit, the unit with the most discretion, ticketed blacks at a rate not only well above the Radar and Tac-Pac Units, but also well above the standard fixed by the violator survey. The calculation insinuates that the Patrol Unit issued merely 5 excess tickets to blacks beyond what would have been expected. The calculation is worthless. First and foremost, Dr. Cupingood deleted the non-radar tickets which presumably involved a greater exercise of discretion. The role police discretion played in the issuance of tickets to blacks was the object of the defense study. Under the guise of comparing only things similarly situated, he thereupon deleted any radar tickets not issued in one of the four time periods he divided each of the thirty-five randomly selected days into for *357 which there was not at least one race identified radar ticket issued by the Patrol Unit and at least one by the combined Radar, Tac-Pac Unit. He provided no justification for either creating the 140 time periods or combining the tickets of the Radar and Tac-Pac Units. To compound his defective analysis, he pooled the data in each time period into a single number and employed the resultant weighted average of the two units to compute the expected and excess, if any, tickets issued to blacks. By using weighted averages, he once again assumed the answer to the question he purported to address. He assumed the Patrol Unit gave the same number of tickets to blacks as did the Radar, Tac-Pac Unit, rather than test to see if it did. Even after "winnowing" the data, the comparison between the Patrol Unit and the Radar, Tac-Pac Unit is marginally statistically significant. Without winnowing, Dr. Kadane found the comparison of the radar tickets issued by the Patrol Unit to blacks with the radar tickets issued by the Radar, Tac-Pac Unit to blacks constituted 3.78 standard deviations which is distinctly above the 5% standard of statistical significance.
The defense did not rest on its statistical evidence alone. Along with the testimony of former troopers Kenneth Ruff and Kenneth Wilson about having been trained and coached to make race based profile stops but whose testimony is weakened by bias related to their not having been reappointed at the end of their terms, the defense elicited evidence through cross-examination of State witnesses and a rebuttal witness, Dr. James Fyfe, that the State Police hierarchy allowed, condoned, cultivated and tolerated discrimination between 1988 and 1991 in its crusade to rid New Jersey of the scourge of drugs.
Conjointly with the passage of the Comprehensive Drug Reform Act of 1987 and to advance the Attorney General's Statewide Action Plan for Narcotics Enforcement issued in January 1988 which "directed that the enforcement of our criminal drug laws shall be the highest priority law enforcement activity", Colonel Pagano formed the Drug Interdiction Training Unit (DITU) in late 1987 consisting of two supervisors and ten other members, two from each Troop selected for their successful seizure statistics, "... to actually patrol with junior road personnel and provide critical on-the-job training in recognizing potential violators." State Police Plan For Action dated July 7, 1987, at p. 14. According to Colonel Pagano, the DITU program was intended to be one step beyond the existing coach program to impart to newer troopers insight into drug enforcement and the "criminal program" (patrol related arrests) in general. DITU was disbanded in or around July 1992.
No training materials remain regarding the training DITU members themselves received, and few training materials remain regarding the training DITU members provided the newer troopers except for a batch of checklists.[8] Just one impact study was ever prepared regarding the effectiveness of the DITU program rather than periodic impact evaluations and studies as required by S.O.P. F4 dated January 12, 1989, but this one undated report marked D-62 in evidence only provided statistics about the number of investigations conducted, the number of persons involved and the quantity and value of drugs seized without indicating the race of those involved or the number of fruitless investigations broken down by race. In the opinion of Dr. Fyfe, retention of training materials is important for review of the propriety of the training and to discern *358 agency policy, and preparation of periodic impact evaluations and studies is important not only to determine the effectiveness of the program from a numbers standpoint, but more than that to enable administration to monitor and control the quality of the program and its impact on the public, especially a crackdown program like DITU which placed so much emphasis on stopping drug transportation by the use of "consents" to search following traffic stops in order to prevent constitutional excesses.
Despite the paucity of training materials and lack of periodic and complete impact evaluations and studies, a glimpse of the work of DITU emerges from the preserved checklists and the testimony of Sergeants Brian Caffrey and David Cobb. Sergeant Caffrey was the original assistant supervisor of DITU and became the supervisor in 1989. Sergeant Cobb was an original member of DITU and became the assistant supervisor in 1989. Sergeant Caffrey left DITU sometime in 1992, Sergeant Cobb sometime in 1991. Both testified that a major purpose of DITU was to teach trainees tip-offs and techniques about what to look for and do to talk or "dig" their way into a vehicle after, not before, a motor vehicle stop to effectuate patrol related arrests. Both denied teaching or using race as a tip-off either before or after a stop. Nevertheless, Sergeant Caffrey condoned a comment by a DITU trainer during the time he was the supervisor of DITU stating:
"Trooper Fash previously had DITU training, and it showed in the way he worked. He has become a little reluctant to stop cars in lieu [sic] of the Channel 9 News Report. He was told as long as he uses Title 39 he can stop any car he wants. He enjoys DITU and would like to ride again."
As the defense observes in its closing brief, "Why would a trooper who is acting in a racially neutral fashion become reluctant to stop cars as a result of a news story charging that racial minorities were being targeted [by the New Jersey State Police]?" Even A.A.G. Ronald Susswein, Deputy Director of the Division of Criminal Justice, acknowledged that this comment is incomplete because it fails to add the caveat, "as long as he doesn't also use race or ethnicity." Further, Sergeant Caffrey testified that "ethnicity is something to keep in mind" albeit not a tip-off and that he taught attendees at both the annual State Police in-service training session in March 1987 and the special State Police in-service training sessions in July and August 1987 that Hispanics are mainly involved in drug trafficking and showed them the film Operation Pipeline wherein the ethnicity of those arrested, mostly Hispanics, is prominently depicted. Dr. Fyfe criticized Sergeant Caffrey's teaching Hispanics are mainly involved and his showing Operation Pipeline as well as the showing of the Jamaican Posse film wherein only blacks are depicted as drug traffickers at the 1989 annual State Police in-service training session saying trainers should not teach what they do not intend their trainees to act upon. At a minimum, teaching Hispanics are mainly involved in drug trafficking and showing films depicting mostly Hispanics and blacks trafficking in drugs at training sessions worked at cross-purposes with concomitant instruction pointing out that neither race nor ethnicity may be considered in making traffic stops.
Key corroboration for finding the State Police hierarchy allowed and tolerated discrimination came from Colonel Pagano. Colonel Pagano was Superintendent of the State Police from 1975 to February 1990. He testified there was a noisy demand in the 1980s to get drugs off the streets. In accord, Attorney General Cary Edwards and he made drug interdiction the number one priority of law enforcement. He helped formulate the Attorney General's Statewide Action Plan for Narcotics Enforcement and established DITU within the State Police. He kept an eye on DITU through conversations with staff officers and Sergeants Mastella and Caffrey and *359 review of reports generated under the traditional reporting system and D-62 in evidence. He had no thought DITU would engage in constitutional violations. He knew all State Police members were taught that they were guardians of the Constitution and that targeting any race was unconstitutional and poor police practice to boot. He recognized it was his responsibility to see that race was not a factor in who was stopped, searched and arrested. When he became Superintendent, he formed the Internal Affairs Bureau to investigate citizen complaints against State Police members to maintain the integrity of the Division. Substantiated deviations from regulations resulted in sanctions, additional training or counseling.
More telling, however, is what Colonel Pagano said and did, or did not do, in response to the Channel 9 exposé entitled "Without Just Cause" which aired in 1989 and which troubled Trooper Fash and what he did not do in response to complaints of profiling from the NAACP and ACLU and these consolidated motions to suppress and similar motions in Warren and Middlesex Counties. He said to Joe Collum of Channel 9 that "[violating rights of motorists was] of serious concern [to him], but no where near the concern that I think we have got to look to in trying to correct some of the problems we find with the criminal element in this State" and "the bottom line is that those stops were not made on the basis of race alone." (emphasis added) Since perhaps these isolated comments were said inadvertently or edited out of context, a truer reflection of his attitude about claims of racism would appear to be his videotaped remarks shown all members of the State Police at roll call in conjunction with the WOR series. Thereon he clearly said that he did not want targeting or discriminatory enforcement and that "[w]hen you put on this uniform, you leave your biases and your prejudices behind." But he also said as regarded the charge of a Trenton school principal named Jones that he had been stopped on the Turnpike and threatened, intimidated and assaulted by a trooper, "We know that the teacher assaulted the trooper. He didn't have a driver's license or a registration for his fancy new Mercedes." (emphasis added) And he called Paul McLemore, the first African-American trooper in New Jersey and now a practicing attorney and who spoke of discrimination within the ranks of the State Police, "an ingrate." And he told the members to "keep the heat on" and then assured them:
"...[H]ere at Division Headquarters we'll make sure that when the wheels start to squeak, we'll do whatever we can to make sure that you're supported out in the field.... Anything that goes toward implementing the Drug Reform Act is important. And, we'll handle the squeaky wheels here."
He admitted the Internal Affairs Bureau was not designed to investigate general complaints, so he could not refer the general complaints of discrimination to it for scrutiny. Yet he never requested the Analytical Unit to investigate stop data from radio logs, patrol charts and tickets or search and seizure data from arrest reports, operations reports, investigation reports and consent to search forms, not even after the Analytical Unit informed him in a report on arrests by region, race and crime that he had requested from it for his use in the WOR series that "... arrests are not a valid reflection of stops (data relative to stops with respect to race is not compiled)." The databases compiled for these motions attest, of course, to the fact that race identified stop data could have been compiled. He testified he could not launch an investigation into every general complaint because of limited resources and that there was insufficient evidence of discriminations in the Channel 9 series, the NAACP and ACLU complaints and the various motions to suppress for him to spend his "precious" resources. In short, he left the issue of discrimination up to the courts and months of testimony in this and other counties at State expense.
The right to be free from discrimination is firmly supported by the Fourteenth *360 Amendment to the United States Constitution and the protections of Article I, paragraphs 1 and 5 of the New Jersey Constitution of 1947. To be sure, "[t]he eradication of the `cancer of discrimination' has long been one of our State's highest priorities." Dixon v. Rutgers, The State University of N.J., 110 N.J. 432, 451, 541 A.2d 1046 (1988). It is indisputable, therefore, that the police may not stop a motorist based on race or any other invidious classification. See State v. Kuhn, 213 N.J.Super. 275, 517 A.2d 162 (1986).
Generally, however, the inquiry for determining the constitutionality of a stop or a search and seizure is limited to "whether the conduct of the law enforcement officer who undertook the [stop or] search was objectively reasonable, without regard to his or her underlying motives or intent." State v. Bruzzese, 94 N.J. 210, 463 A.2d 320 (1983). Thus, it has been said that the courts will not inquire into the motivation of a police officer whose stop of a vehicle was based upon a traffic violation committed in his presence. See United States v. Smith, 799 F.2d 704, 708-709 (11th Cir.1986); United States v. Hollman, 541 F.2d 196, 198 (8th Cir.1976); cf. United States v. Villamonte-Marquez, 462 U.S. 579, 103 S.Ct. 2573, 77 L.Ed.2d 22 (1983). But where objective evidence establishes "that a police agency has embarked upon an officially sanctioned or de facto policy of targeting minorities for investigation and arrest," any evidence seized will be suppressed to deter future insolence in office by those charged with enforcement of the law and to maintain judicial integrity. State v. Kennedy, 247 N.J.Super. 21, 588 A.2d 834 (App.Div. 1991).
Statistics may be used to make out a case of targeting minorities for prosecution of traffic offenses provided the comparison is between the racial composition of the motorist population violating the traffic laws and the racial composition of those arrested for traffic infractions on the relevant roadway patrolled by the police agency. Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, supra; State v. Kennedy, 247 N.J.Super. at 33-34, 588 A.2d 834. While defendants have the burden of proving "the existence of purposeful discrimination," discriminatory intent may be inferred from statistical proof presenting a stark pattern or an even less extreme pattern in certain limited contexts. McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 107 S.Ct 1756, 95 L.Ed.2d 262 (1987). Kennedy, supra, implies that discriminatory intent may be inferred from statistical proof in a traffic stop context probably because only uniform variables (Title 39 violations) are relevant to the challenged stops and the State has an opportunity to explain the statistical disparity. "[A] selection procedure that is susceptible of abuse... supports the presumption of discrimination raised by the statistical showing." Castaneda v. Partida, 430 U.S. 482, 494, 97 S.Ct. 1272, 51 L.Ed.2d 498 (1977).
Once defendants expose a prima facie case of selective enforcement, the State generally cannot rebut it by merely calling attention to possible flaws or unmeasured variables in defendants' statistics. Rather, the State must introduce specific evidence showing that either there actually are defects which bias the results or the missing factors, when properly organized and accounted for, eliminate or explain the disparity. Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U.S. 385, 106 S.Ct. 3000, 92 L.Ed.2d 315 (1986); EEOC v. General Telephone Co. of Northwest, Inc., 885 F.2d 575 (9th Cir.1989). Nor will mere denials or reliance on the good faith of the officers suffice. Castaneda v. Partida, 430 U.S. at 498 n. 19, 97 S.Ct. 1272, 51 L.Ed.2d 498.
Here, defendants have proven at least a de facto policy on the part of the State Police out of the Moorestown Station of targeting blacks for investigation and arrest between April 1988 and May 1991 both south of exit 3 and between exits 1 and 7A of the Turnpike. Their surveys satisfy Wards Cove, supra. The statistical disparities and standard deviations revealed are indeed stark. The discretion devolved upon general road *361 troopers to stop any car they want as long as Title 39 is used evinces a selection process that is susceptible of abuse. The utter failure of the State Police hierarchy to monitor and control a crackdown program like DITU or investigate the many claims of institutional discrimination manifests its indifference if not acceptance. Against all this, the State submits only denials and the conjecture and flawed studies of Dr. Cupingood.
The eradication of illegal drugs from our State is an obviously worthy goal, but not at the expense of individual rights. As Justice Brandeis so wisely said dissenting in Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 479, 48 S.Ct. 564, 72 L.Ed. 944 (1928):
"Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evilminded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding."
Motions granted.
NOTES
[1]  The motions also include claims under the Fourth Amendment, but they were severed before the hearing to await future proceedings if not rendered moot by this decision.
[2]  Originally, twenty-three defendants joined in the motions. On the first day of the hearing, November 28, 1994, I dismissed the motions of Darrell Stanley, Roderick Fitzgerald, Fred Robinson, Charles W. Grayer, Keith Perry and Alton Williams due to their unexplained nonappearances.
[3]  Dr. Lamberth erred in using 13.5% as the standard for comparison with the stop data. The violator survey indicates that 14 .8%, rounded to 15%, of those observed speeding were black. This percentage is the percentage Dr. Lamberth should have used in making statistical comparisons with the stop data in the databases. Nonetheless, it would appear that whatever the correctly calculated disparities and standard deviations are, they would be nearly equal to those calculated by Dr. Lamberth.
[4]  In this opinion I am ignoring the arrest data in the databases and Dr. Lamberth's analysis thereof since neither side produced any evidence identifying the Turnpike population between exits 1 and 3 or 1 and 7A eligible to be arrested for drug offenses or otherwise. See Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U.S. 642, 109 S.Ct. 2115, 104 L.Ed.2d 733 (1989).
[5]  That 62.6 percent of the stops in the defense database are not race identified is a consequence of both the destruction of the radio logs for ten of the thirty-five randomly selected days in accordance with the State Police document retention policy and the frequent dereliction of State Police members to comply with S.O.P. F3 effective July 13, 1984 requiring them to communicate by radio to their respective stations the race of all occupants of vehicles stopped prior to any contact.
[6]  Of the 3060 stops in the databases, 1292 are ticketed stops. Hence, no tickets were issued for nearly 60% of the stops.
[7]  During the hearing the State did attempt to introduce some annual speed surveys conducted on the Turnpike by the New JerseyDepartment of Transportation which the State represented would contradict a conclusion of the violator survey that 98.1% of the vehicles observed travelled in excess of sixty miles per hour. Besides noting that the State knew of these surveys long before the hearing and failed to produce them in discovery, I denied the proffer mainly because the surveys lacked racial data and also because there was a serious issue over their trustworthiness for admission under N.J.R.E. 803(c)(8) since the surveys were done to receive federal highway dollars. The critical information here is the racial mix of those eligible to be stopped, not the percentage of vehicles exceeding the speed limit.
[8]  Although DITU kept copies of all arrest, operations and investigation reports and consent to search forms growing out of encounters with the public during training for a time at its office, the copies were destroyed sometime in 1989 or 1990 and before they were sought in discovery. The originals of these reports and forms were filed at the trainee's station and incorporated into the State Police "traditional reporting system" making them impossible to ferret out now.

*932 Saul Stone and Warren O. Coleman, both of New Orleans, La., for appellant.
Herbert W. Christenberry, U. S. Atty., of New Orleans, La., for appellee.
Before HUTCHESON, HOLMES, and McCORD, Circuit Judges.
*933 McCORD, Circuit Judge.
Arthur A. Steiner, Esther E. Stein, and James R. Stewart were tried, convicted, and sentenced under five counts of a six-count indictment which charged them with use of the mails in furtherance of a scheme to defraud, in violation of Section 215 of the Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C.A. § 338. Steiner alone has appealed.
The indictment charges and the proof shows that Steiner, Stein, and Stewart evolved and put into practice a scheme to procure fraudulent reductions of tax assessments on real and personal property in the City of New Orleans, Louisiana. Steiner, a lawyer, solicited and secured taxpayer clients, agreeing for a fee to secure a tax assessment reduction from the Louisiana Tax Commission. Stewart, chief clerk in the New Orleans office of the Tax Commission, by virtue of his position of trust and confidence, had the client's assessment reduced on the tax rolls and approved by the Commission. Thereafter the taxpayer paid the taxes on the basis of the fraudulently reduced assessment, and from month to month and day to day the monies so paid were covered into the public treasuries. Stein acted as go-between for Steiner and Stewart.
The partners agreed to divide the proceeds of their nefarious scheme. Steiner charged clients a fee of usually one-half of the tax savings, and it was agreed that upon collection of such fees Steiner was to get one-fourth, Stein one-fourth, and Stewart one-half. On occasion letters were written by Steiner for the purpose of collecting fees from clients, and it is shown that Stein had statement forms printed bearing the heading "Steiner and Stein"; that such forms were used to send statements to clients; and that the forms were furnished to Stewart who mailed them to clients when he had fraudulently procured the agreed assessment reductions. By this scheme a fraud of the most reprehensible kind was perpetrated upon the State of Louisiana, its agencies, and taxpayers, in that assessments were reduced unfairly, inequitably, and fraudulently, thereby preventing collection of the full amount of taxes rightfully due.
The evidence is without dispute that Steiner and his partners defrauded the State and its taxpayers out of many thousands of dollars; that theirs was a continuous and continuing scheme whereby they reaped a rich harvest of unlawful gain not only for one year, but in many cases from year to year; and that after paying taxes for one year taxpayers would find their assessments for the new year raised, and the partners would again have the assessments fraudulently reduced, and send out bills and receive payments. With Stewart working in the Tax Commission office as chief clerk and being in charge of tax estimates and settlements and fully trusted by the Tax Commissioners, the fraudulent scheme might have indefinitely would its way through devious trails of corruption and fraud; but Steiner, having once embarked on the crime way, could not bring himself to divide the spoils as he had agreed to do. It was only one more step for him to steal from his confederates, and when he did, they commenced to complain and then to threaten him for their part of the monies which he had withheld. Cornered and trapped by his dissatisfied confederates, and facing detection and disgrace, Steiner thereupon sought out an officer of the Louisiana Bar Association and attempted to gain immunity for himself by turning informer against his partners and others whom he named and alleged were engaged in the unlawful "tax racket".
That the mails of the United States were used in furtherance of the scheme cannot, we think, be doubted. The scheme was a continuous one in which these partners in crime worked hand-in-glove to defeat the collection of lawful taxes. The mailing of letters and statements to clients for the collection of fees was a necessary, indeed indispensable, element of that scheme, for without money to bribe Stewart and divide with Stein and Steiner the partnership would have failed. The continuity of the scheme is shown by evidence that clients who withdrew their patronage had their assessments raised. There is no dispute but that tax payments were made after entry of the fraudulent assessment reductions on the tax books. Moreover, if the fees were not paid by clients it reasonably follows that Stewart, who worked the fraud to get the assessments reduced, could use his place and position to get them raised again. In one instance where a client thought a reduction from approximately $140,000.00 to $40,000.00 was too much and declined to accept Steiner's services in the matter, the assessment was caused by the partner Stewart to be raised to in excess of $80,00.00, an amount acceptable to the taxpayer. Lane Cotton Mills which dispensed with these most successful reduction services *934 after using them for several years found that upon dismissal of Steiner its assessments soared even higher than before.
Appellant contends that the scheme to defraud the State and its taxpayers was consummated at the instant the illegal tax assessment reductions were entered on the books of the Tax Commission; and that the mails were used after the execution of the scheme and in connection with matters wholly outside the scheme to defraud. Cf. McNear v. United States, 10 Cir., 60 F.2d 861; Dyhre v. Hudspeth, 10 Cir., 106 F.2d 286; Spillers v. United States, 5 Cir., 47 F.2d 893; Stapp v. United States, 5 Cir., 120 F.2d 898. The case at bar is not controlled by those decisions, for here the scheme to defraud had not come to an end when the mails were used. Unless money came in, the scheme would not and could not operate, for Stewart, the keyman with access to the tax rolls, Steiner, the soliciting lawyer, and Stein, the go-between, were all in the scheme for what they could get out of it. The collection of fees for "services rendered" was an integral part of the continuous and operating scheme to defraud, and the mails were used to accomplish their collection. When one of the schemers used the mails for collection of fees in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme, all defendants being partners in crime, were responsible for the mailing. Tincher v. United States, 4 Cir., 11 F.2d 18; Hart v. United States, 5 Cir., 112 F.2d 128.
Under Section 215 of the Criminal Code, the mail fraud statute, it is sufficient to charge and prove that there was a scheme to defraud; that the mails were used or caused to be used in furtherance of the scheme; and that the scheme was one which "reasonably contemplated the use of the mails". A careful review of the evidence in this rather lengthy record discloses that the government proved the essential elements of the offenses charged, and that there was no fatal variance between the charges and the proof. Spivey v. United States, 5 Cir., 109 F.2d 181; Corbett v. United States, 8 Cir., 89 F.2d 124; Guardalibini v. United States, 5 Cir., 128 F.2d 984; United States v. Lowe, 7 Cir., 115 F. 2d 596; Hart v. United States, supra.
Steiner attacks the sufficiency of the evidence to show the mailings alleged in the first two counts of the indictment, and further alleges that for purposes of venue there was no proof that the letter in the second count was mailed in New Orleans. The statement forming the basis of the first count was introduced in evidence. It was on the billhead of "Steiner and Stein", and was addressed to Longino & Collins, 3801 Tulane Avenue, New Orleans, La. The witness R. K. Longino produced the letter from his files, and testified that the statement was found with the stamped and postmarked envelope pinned to it. The bill bore date of December 31, 1938, and the envelope bore a postmark dated January 4, 1939. The witness Hugh M. Wilkinson, to whom Steiner had revealed the details of the scheme, and who had discussed a similar statement with Steiner, testified that Steiner had said that when a customer failed to pay the agreed fee, "Stewart himself would mail this bill on the billhead of Steiner and Stein * * *." The collection letter forming the basis of the second count was written to Intertype Corporation, 360 Furman Street, Brooklyn, New York. The letter was typed for Steiner by his secretary; it requested payment of the account "by return mail". The letter bore date of February 12, 1938, and was received in the New York office of Intertype two days later on February 14, 1938. An officer and an employee of Intertype Corporation testified to the manner of handling mail in the New York office, and that this letter was received by Intertype Corporation in due course through the mail. Although circumstantial in character, the proof concerning the mailing of the billhead and letter was sufficient to warrant submission of the question of mailing to the jury, and to establish that the letter to Intertype Corporation was in fact mailed at New Orleans. Cf. Corbett v. United States, 8 Cir., 89 F.2d 124; United States v. Baker, 2 Cir., 50 F.2d 122.
No contention is urged concerning the sufficiency of proof of the mailings charged in counts 4, 5 and 6 of the indictment.
It is contended that the testimony of the witness Hugh M. Wilkinson should have been excluded as being based on statements made to him by Steiner at a time when the relationship of attorney and client existed, and that, therefore, such statements were privileged and inadmissible. When the objection was made below, the jury was retired and the court proceeded to hear evidence bearing upon the relationship existing between Steiner and Wilkinson at the time the statements were made. The evidence *935 was in sharp conflict: Steiner saying that he consulted Wilkinson as an attorney, and Wilkinson saying that there was no attorney and client relationship. Wilkinson testified that he was a member of the Board of Governors of the Louisiana Bar Association; that Steiner came to him and told him that he was involved in trouble and wanted to resign from the practice of law; and that Steiner revealed the tax reduction scheme in detail. Having heard the testimony of Steiner, Wilkinson, and other witnesses, the trial court found that the relationship of attorney and client had not been shown and that the evidence definitely established that no such relationship existed between Steiner and Wilkinson at any time. Accordingly, Wilkinson was allowed to testify.
The fact that one is a lawyer does not disqualify him as a witness, for he, like any other person, may testify to any competent facts except those which came to his knowledge by means of confidential relations with his client. The existence of that relationship is a question of fact to be inquired into by the court preliminary to the admission or rejection of the proffered testimony. Here the preliminary inquiry was properly conducted and there was no error in the court's ruling allowing Wilkinson to testify. Smale v. United States, 7 Cir., 3 F.2d 101; Underhill's Criminal Evidence, 4th Ed., §§ 333, 334, 335; Wharton's Criminal Evidence, 10th Ed., § 497; Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd Ed., Vol. VIII, § 322, pp. 626-7.
There is no merit in the contention that the statements made by Steiner to Wilkinson constituted an involuntary confession made as a result of "promises, inducements, and hopes of reward". Wilkinson merely offered to lend his personal influence to secure leniency for Steiner. Wilkinson was not a law enforcement officer. Steiner was not in custody or under arrest, and no force, coercion, or duress was used to procure the statements. The statements were voluntarily made and were admissible in evidence. Furthermore, the court did not abuse its discretion in restricting cross-examination of Wilkinson regarding political matters.
Steiner further contends that he was denied the right of public trial in that legal matters with reference to the conduct of the trial were argued by government and defense counsel "in sotto voce at the bench in full view of the jury, but out of hearing of the defendant and the public". At the beginning of the trial the judge announced that the jury would be retired only in the event of extended argument on legal matters, and that other arguments on objections would be made by counsel at the bench. No objection was interposed by counsel to this practice. As the trial progressed numerous brief arguments were had at the bench out of hearing of the jury. Steiner's counsel participated in many of the conferences, and Steiner was always present in the court room when such conferences were held. Neither he nor his counsel complained or made objection at any time to the practice, and we think it clear that he was in no wise prejudiced. Both he and his counsel were satisfied with the procedure at the trial, and the assignment of error and the contention on the point seems to be nothing more than an afterthought by which fair conduct, in which they acquiesced and participated, is sought to be distorted into impropriety and alleged prejudicial error. The assignment is wholly without merit. See Johnson v. United States, 63 S.Ct. 549, 87 L.Ed. ___, decided February 15, 1943.
Complaint is made of the fact that the trial judge questioned certain witnesses during the trial. Many of the questions propounded by him were helpful in developing the facts of the case. He showed no partiality in his questioning and did not assume the role of prosecutor, a practice condemned in Adler v. United States, 5 Cir., 182 F. 464; cf. Moore v. United States, 5 Cir., 123 F.2d 207. At times the court's questions were helpful in bringing forth answers altogether favorable to Steiner and his co-defendants. In fact, the questions propounded did much to develop facts which led to exclusion of certain evidence and the consequent abandonment and withdrawal of the third count of the indictment. Moreover, the court was careful to instruct the jury that they were the sole judges of the facts, and that they were not to infer from his questioning that he had views one way or the other concerning the guilt or innocence of the defendants. The questioning of witnesses by the court did not constitute error. Moore v. United States, 5 Cir., 132 F.2d 47; United States v. Lee, 7 Cir., 107 F.2d 522.
The evidence made a case for the jury, and the court properly refused to grant the motion for a directed verdict. After a careful review of the record we *936 find no reversible error in the rulings of the court as to the admission or exclusion of evidence, including admission of duly authenticated photostatic copies of income tax returns. In the charge the court fully and fairly stated the law applicable to the case, and with care and prudence cautioned the jury not to be influenced by the fact that the defendants, as they had a constitutional right to do, elected not to take the stand to testify in their own behalf.
No reversible error appears and the verdict is supported by the evidence. The judgment is affirmed.
HUTCHESON, Circuit Judge (specially concurring).
I agree with my associates that the record leaves in no doubt that appellant and his confederates did, as the indictment charges, devise a scheme to defraud, "the State of Louisiana, the City of New Orleans, the Orleans Parish School Board, the Board of Commissioners of the Orleans Levee District, and Agencies of the State of Louisiana and of the City of New Orleans, and the taxpayers of the State of Louisiana and of the City of New Orleans". I agree with them, too, that the evidence supports the finding that the indictment letters were mailed as charged, that it was not error to receive Wilkinson's testimony, that there was no prejudicial error in the complained of conduct of the trial judge, and that if the mails of the United States were used for the furtherance of the scheme, the judgment should be affirmed.
Appellant, reads the indictment as not including within those to be defrauded by the scheme the taxpayers to whom the bills were sent. He argues that under the rule applied, in Stapp v. United States, 5 Cir., 120 F.2d 898, and Spillers v. United States, 5 Cir., 47 F.2d 893, to reverse, and in Hart v. United States, 5 Cir., 112 F.2d 128, to affirm, a conviction, the bills mailed to the clients after the reductions had been secured were not mailed in furtherance of the scheme because, a scheme to defraud the taxing agencies alone, it had already been consummated.
I cannot agree with this reading of the indictment. I think it clear that "the taxpayers of the State of Louisiana and of the City of New Orleans", alleged in the indictment as victims of the scheme, were the taxpayer clients, victimized by paying for fraudulent services which they had been led to believe were to be honest and faithful services.
A reading of the indictment on page 5 of the record leaves this in no doubt. It is there alleged that the "said defendants * * * would pretend and represent that they were engaged in the legitimate business of procuring and obtaining for taxpayers reductions in their tax assessments on real and personal property on the official tax record * * * which said assessments the said defendants * * * would pretend, represent and claim to the said taxpayers were erroneous, excessive and improper; that they would approach and solicit taxpayers to whom they would represent, pretend and claim that they would appear before the Louisiana Tax Commission as the authorized representatives of said taxpayers for the purpose of establishing and obtaining fair assessments on the real and personal property of said taxpayers, * * * that it was a part of said scheme and artifice to defraud, that the defendants * * * would pretend to taxpayers whom they would solicit and approach that they would employ only legitimate and honest means in effecting such reductions in assessments; that the defendants * * * would obtain contracts * * * which would provide for the payment to them as compensation for their services in obtaining any such reductions in assessments contingent fees of 50 percent of the amount of taxes saved by such taxpayers by reason of any such reduction."
Though, therefore, I cannot agree with the holding of the majority that, taking as correct the view that the scheme, as alleged in the indictment, was one to defraud the taxing agencies alone, and the victims of it were those agencies and the other taxpayers whose assessments had not been reduced, the indictment letters must still be held to have been sent in furtherance of that scheme, I do agree that the judgment must be affirmed. For the indictment charges a scheme to defraud defendant's clients as well as the public, and the sending of the indictment letters was not only in furtherance of, it was essential to, the scheme to defraud.

MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
KLEIN, United States Magistrate Judge.
On January 20, 1993, defendants Mahlon A. Dize, Sr., Wayne W. Dize, Geoffrey K. Fox, Stephen J. Grafton, Edgar J. Orme, III, Larry W. Penn, and William W. Stone, Sr. *1171 ["defendants"] were hunting migratory birds  Canada geese  on the property known as Jamaica Point Farm ["the farm"] located in Talbot County, Maryland. The hunt was terminated by officials of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ["USFWS"]. The defendants, and others,[1] were charged with various violations of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act ["MBTA"], 16 U.S.C. §§ 703-711. Specifically, all defendants were charged with taking or attempting to take migratory waterfowl with the aid of bait. See 50 CFR § 20.21(i). Defendants Grafton and Orme were also charged with aiding and abetting the taking or attempted taking of migratory waterfowl with the aid of bait. Id. Defendant Orme was additionally charged with taking or attempting to take migratory birds while possessing lead shot. See 50 CFR § 20.21(j).
All defendants pled "Not Guilty," and waived their right to a trial, judgment and sentencing before a district judge. A bench trial on all charges was conducted before the undersigned on July 22-23, 1993. Defendants Grafton and Orme were represented by counsel. All other defendants waived their right to counsel. After the presentation of evidence and closing arguments by counsel and the pro se defendants, this Court held the matter sub curia. This Memorandum and Order constitutes the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law.

FACTS

1958-1992
There is really no great dispute among the parties concerning the activities on Jamaica Point Farm[2] for a number of years leading up to the fall of 1992.
The approximately 400 acre farm was purchased by Mackall O. Owings ["Os" or "Owings"] in 1958.[3] During the ensuing years Os made numerous improvements to the real estate to induce migratory waterfowl to seek refuge on the property. Early on he began feeding Canada geese in an area surrounding his home and the adjoining Manor House. Owings notes in his book, which was written in 1990:
There is no question that we see the same Canada geese year after year. Years ago, when we were cultivating this concentration, they would arrive in the fall and sit in the river or on the shore or go into the field, but it would be several weeks before they would venture onto our lawn. As years passed, they would come onto the lawn soon after they arrived.
Def. Exh. 3 at 51.
I am sure that the same geese come onto the lawn every day. They can be identified by their yellow neck bands. We read the numbers on the bands and report them to the Department of the Interior in Washington, who advises us when and where the geese were banded. The recorded numbers provide a constant check on our returning visitors.
Id. at 52. Os Owings described his activities with regard to enticing migratory waterfowl to his property as a "sanctuary feeding program." He was also quick to admit that the *1172 birds on his property were hunted during the respective seasons.
That Owings was successful in his quest to attract Canada geese to his farm was attested to by several witnesses. George W. Lacey, a special agent/pilot with USFWS testified that his family lived on Jamaica Point Farm in the 1950s before Owings purchased it. He stated that since 1984 he has noticed Canada geese resting in the "feed area" around Owings' home and the Manor House. Over the last four years the concentration of Canada geese on the farm has gotten greater according to Lacey. He has surveilled the property on approximately five occasions over the last five years. According to George N. Ball, Jr., a law enforcement officer with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources ["DNR"], over the past few years there has been a large number of Canada geese on Owings' farm as opposed to other farms in the area. The largest concentration of birds has been in the vicinity of the Owings residence and in the ponds along Jamaica Point Road. Burton E. Wheedleton, a retired DNR officer who is familiar with the farm, also indicated that the farm always had a large concentration of Canada geese when compared to the surrounding farms. Indeed, when Wheedleton was asked by his superiors in 1975 for a recommendation of a place where the department could locate and band large numbers of Canada geese, his recommendation was Jamaica Point Farm.
In his book, Owings states: "We planted crops for geese and fed corn regularly from the day geese first arrived in October until the last ones left in April." Gov't Exh. No. 9 at 190 (emphasis supplied). This evidence of past feeding of Canada geese on the farm was corroborated by the testimony of several witnesses. Officer Ball was on the farm in December 1989 and watched Os and others spread several five gallon buckets of corn around his house. According to Ball, the geese consumed all the corn while he was standing there. Lawrence E. Albright, who currently lives in the Manor house, is familiar with the placement of corn on the farm. He testified that corn was "always" put on the Owings' lawn or off the dock which adjoined their residence. In the beginning, it was only buckets of corn, but for the past several years Os started using a spreader. The grain was put out almost every day. Os made the decision as to when and where to spread the feed. Albright indicated that he helped Owings put the feed out up until 1992. Defendant Orme testified that he had helped Owings spread grain and, additionally had asked defendant Grafton to help when Os became unable to do it himself. According to Orme about three bushels or 160 pounds of corn were spread every day.
There was testimony from several witnesses that over the years Owings was warned on several occasions that he should not be feeding during the various hunting seasons. Agent Lacey said that both Willie Parker and Larry Thurman[4] told Os not to spread corn in the front field where he was putting it. In addition, on at least one occasion, Lacey said Thurman took samples of corn from the water around the Owings' property and charged Os with violation of the MBTA. Burton Wheedleton also testified to a telephone conversation he had with Os in 1987. According to Wheedleton, he told Owings "[i]f you are going to feed during the hunting season that's contrary to federal and state regulations. It's illegal." Wheedleton also testified that he never found any corn during hunting seasons. Testifying contrary to these witnesses was defendant Orme who alleged that federal wardens visited the farm many times from 1962 to 1992. They checked licenses, shotguns, bag limits, etc., and never made any "allusions" about hunting over bait.
Apparently there were complaints from those not involved with the farm that the farm was being baited. Lawrence Albright testified that he received complaints of baiting during the second year that the spreader was used to disperse the corn. USFWS Agent Frank T. Kuncir testified that he had received complaints about the farm and possible baiting as early as 1988. Air and ground surveillance at that time showed large concentrations of geese on "the point itself"  i.e., the area around the Owings' residence.
*1173 In 1987, Jamaica Point Farm became one of the first properties, if not the first, to participate in the Sanctuary Program under the auspices of the Easton Waterfowl Festival. According to Lawrence Albright, who was the chairman of the sanctuary program at that time, the purpose of the program is to provide safe areas for geese in the winter. The raison d'etre of the program was that the goose population was dropping, habitat was being depleted, and geese were having difficulty finding safe resting areas in the winter. In return for providing a safe sanctuary, the landowner/farmer is paid to leave $1,000.00 worth of crops standing in the fields as food for the geese. It is not part of the program that the geese otherwise be fed by the landowner/farmer. A copy of the contract for the sanctuary program at the farm for the 1991-92 season was placed in evidence as Gov't Exh. No. 11. Mr. Albright emphasized that the program "is not a feeding or hunting program. It is a sanctuary program." The program is managed by the Chesapeake Wildlife Heritage ["CWH"]. John E. Gerber, III, a biologist with CWH, stated that the intent of the program is to provide a grazing area that is a safe haven for birds. It is not the program's intent that the landowner/farmer spread large quantities of loose corn. Mr. Albright, because of the complaints about baiting on the farm decided to "pull the farm out of the sanctuary program" in the summer of 1992. He personally informed Owings of his decision. After that conversation, communication broke down between Albright and Owings. Albright went so far as to ask Owings' son to request that his father stop distributing grain. Owings declined to do so.

FALL 1992  JANUARY 1993
Frank Kuncir testified that he began surveilling the property in October of 1992 by routinely driving through the farm on public roads. On those occasions he noted large concentrations of geese near the ponds and in the fields. On November 10th, before sunrise, he went onto the farm where he saw approximately 200 geese on the pond adjacent to the hunting blinds. According to the witness, there were approximately 11,000 geese on the farm. He indicated that he walked to a point within forty yards of the Owings residence and did not disturb any geese. Kuncir returned to the farm shortly after sunrise on January 15, 1993, and noticed several hunters in a blind among cedar trees. On January 16th and 17th the farm was surveilled by Officer Lacey. On January 20th, Kuncir returned to the farm with several other agents. He noted that a large flock of geese approached from the north and landed out of his sight in the grassy area around the Owings' residence. Shortly thereafter, a large number of vehicles proceeded towards the barn next to the Manor House. Kuncir heard a tractor start and then saw the tractor pulling a cart with hunters and their gear in it. All hunters went into pits or blinds and hunted for approximately two-and-a-half hours. A map of the farm taken from the Talbot County land records was submitted as Gov't Exh. No. 1. Kuncir marked an "A" on that exhibit where the corn was spread and a "B" where hunters were located in several blinds.[5] At approximately 9:34 a.m. Kuncir terminated the surveillance and contacted the hunters who were in the blinds around the ponds. In the first pit Kuncir found an outdoor writer and his photographer. In the second pit he found four others who admitted that they had been hunting.[6] Kuncir was told by the hunters that both of these blinds were controlled by defendant Orme. Kuncir also found an empty blind which contained two buckets, several expended shells, a cushion and 12 gauge copper coated lead shot. See Gov't Exh. No. 10(h). The agent could not testify whether or not these shells had been fired on the 20th. Owings, who was not *1174 hunting on this day, apparently came from his residence and was talking to several agents. Kuncir joined the conversation when Os acknowledged that there was an ongoing feeding operation at the farm. About this time, defendant Grafton arrived at the barn driving Orme's pickup truck. Found in the truck were the bucket seen earlier at the blind, numerous unfired and expended shells, and a box of copper coated lead shot which matched the type of shells found in the blind. Orme appeared dressed in street clothes about three hours after the hunt had been terminated. Orme acknowledged that he had been hunting that morning as well as the ongoing feeding operation on the farm. He also stated that he and Grafton had alternated spreading the corn. After the hunters departed, Kuncir walked the lane from the area of the Manor House to the ponds and found corn on both sides of the road.[7] According to Kuncir, the corn along Jamaica Point Road ran for approximately 568 paces and was ninety-eight paces from the closest blind. No other corn was visible along Jamaica Point Road. He acknowledged that Jamaica Point Road is a public road with trees running along both sides. The witness also admitted that this corn "could be consistent with corn falling off a truck," but "if the corn was the result of spillage, I'd expect to find corn all along the road." Kuncir then inspected the Jamaica Point area and found evidence that large numbers of geese had been present. When he finally left the farm, Agent Kuncir went to defendant Grafton's place of business in Easton, Maryland. Grafton acknowledged that he had had a phone conversation with Orme that morning. Grafton also admitted that he had spread corn on both January 10th and 17th "to hold the birds on the farm." According to Grafton, 240 pounds of corn were spread each day. When told about the corn along Jamaica Point Road, Grafton indicated that it must have been as the result of grain delivery to the farm. Subsequently, Kuncir obtained the records of Trappe Landing Grain Co., Gov't Exh. No. 8, which indicate that between October 1992 and January 1993, approximately 31,900 pounds of corn were delivered to the farm. The last delivery was on January 18th. Kuncir testified that there was a large pile of corn in the barn on January 20th.
George Lacey testified that in early January 1993, he was asked to assist in the surveillance of Jamaica Point Farm. While on the farm on January 16th, he found evidence of hunting, but no corn. On January 17th he observed a large number of Canada geese. At approximately 8:15 a.m. on the 17th a car drove from the Owings' residence to the barn. Lacey heard a tractor proceed from the barn towards the Owings' residence. The witness noticed geese walk away from the Owings' house and toward the tractor. He then saw a reflection of "yellow" being broadcast behind the tractor. The geese then stopped and put their heads down. "Many more geese arrived and it was a feeding frenzy." Lacey took a photograph of someone operating the tractor that morning. See Gov't Exh. No. 10(p). While he was on the premises, Lacey noted that a flock of geese took off from the feeding area, went to the ponds and then returned to the feeding area. Another flock came off of the river, over the ponds, and landed in the "baited" area. On January 18th, Lacey returned to the farm and found no one hunting. The next day, he obtained a search and seizure warrant for the tractor and implements. Lacey returned to the farm on January 20th and noted approximately the same number of birds as he had seen previously. He flushed some geese off of the ponds and they flew directly to the feeding area. Around 7:00 a.m., hunters took up their positions in the blinds. Lacey then focused his attention on the feeding area. At 8:40 a.m. he noted a flight take off. Sounds of calls were heard from the ponds, but the geese flew away. Approximately twenty minutes later, another small flock took off, calls were again heard, shots were fired, four birds fell, and the balance of the flock flew back to the feeding area. Gov't Exh. No. 10(j-1) is a photograph of this flight of geese. At 9:11 a.m. another flock took off and veered to the west. A minute later two birds took off followed by twenty more. All of these geese flew toward the ponds. Two geese were killed and the remainder veered off. At 9:35 a.m. the hunting *1175 was terminated. Lacey later went to the Owings' house and told Owings what had occurred. Os' response was "I don't bait, I feed." He admitted that he fed the geese from September through the time they leave in April. Owings told Lacey that he leased the property to Ned Orme to hunt. Up to January 20th, Orme had paid Os $7,000.00 for the season. Os indicated that Orme and a Steve Springer spread the corn for him. Lacey believes that Owings meant Steve Grafton instead of Steve Springer. Later that same day, Lacey executed a search warrant that he had obtained the day before. The subjects of the search warrant were the tractor and related equipment and the barn area. Gov't Exh. Nos. 10(o), 10(d), and 10(e) are photographs of the corn, spreader, and buckets. At the agents' request, calculations were made of the distances to the ponds and the ditch. These distances, which were calculated to be 930 yards (2,790 feet) and 1,633 yards (4,899 feet) respectively, were not significantly different than the calculations made by defendant Orme's expert surveyor, Michael E. Turner, who found the distances to be 2,795.53 feet and 4,666.29 feet respectively. See Def. Orme Exh. No. 1. It was Lacey's opinion that both of these areas would be considered "baited."
George N. Ball, Jr., a DNR agent in charge of Talbot, Caroline and Dorchester Counties, Maryland, testified that he is familiar with Jamaica Point Farm, particularly over the past few years. He has seen a large number of geese on the farm as opposed to other farms in the area. Ball stated that geese are attracted to the adjoining Dell farm because they leave a lot of standing corn. The largest concentrations on the farm are in the area of the Owings' residence and in the ponds along Jamaica Point Road. He noted that Talbot County is a natural area for geese. Ball has received several reports of illegal hunting on the farm and, in December 1989, he went to the farm and saw several five gallon buckets in a jeep. He watched "them" put out the feed and also watched as the geese consumed all of the corn in a short period of time. At that time, Ball did not say anything to Owings. Ball testified that he is "generally familiar" with the term "lure and attraction." He stated that the impact of corn on migratory birds is "significant." "The more you put out, the more birds you hold." In his opinion, there was a fairly good hunting success rate on the farm. Ball stated that migratory waterfowl will establish their own flyways so if repeated feeding is conducted, the birds will establish flyways over those areas. He noted that the geese on the farm came into the feeding area and then went to ponds both on and off the farm. However, most geese stayed on the farm. On January 20th, Ball was in the area of the ponds along Jamaica Point Road. There he met four hunters including defendant Grafton. Ball later stopped defendant Fox coming from the ditch area and wearing hunting apparel. At the area of the ponds, Ball talked with Os who stated that he had "never seen that many geese on the roadway." Grafton claimed that the corn in the road was from the "harvest." The witness then noted that there was no natural corn anywhere on the farm. Ball advised Kuncir that he had found corn along the road and later the two of them picked up several samples. The corn was along each side of the road and stopped at the driveway to the Manor House. He did not consider that the road area was a natural place to bait because there were cedar trees on both sides of the road. However, the placement of the corn along the road was not consistent with corn being delivered to the farm because of its location. Ball did not see defendant Orme when the hunt was terminated. Several of the hunters told him that Orme was in the area of the standing corn by the ponds. Later, the witness followed a pickup truck off the farm. The driver of the truck stopped to make a phone call at a pay phone. He then drove to a restaurant on Route 50 where he met Orme in the parking lot. Both then drove into Easton and parked behind some storage sheds. There Ball stopped Orme and was told that Orme left the hunt early to "go to a job." In Ball's opinion, the entire Jamaica Point Farm would be considered a baited area.
Mark J. Komenda, a DNR agent, testified that he was called to the farm on January 20th after the hunt was terminated. He met Lacey on the main road in front of the Manor *1176 House. They then proceeded to the area of the ponds along Jamaica Point Farm. Komenda informed Lacey that he had seen hunters in the ditch area on the western part of the farm. This is the area marked "C" on Gov't Exh. No. 1. There he talked with seven individuals  Stone, Wayne Dize, Mahlon Dize, Penn, and three others. All were dressed in hunting attire and were carrying shotguns. None denied that they were hunting. Two dead geese were seized from this group.
The next witness was DNR Agent Joseph Schauber who was present at the farm on January 20th. Before the hunt began, he was in position on the river's edge one half a mile north of Jamaica Point. Small flights of birds were observed in the area. Around 8:30 a.m., approximately 800 geese approached from the northwest. This flock landed in the feeding area. The witness observed smaller groups leaving the feeding area flying toward the ponds. Schauber indicated that he was familiar with the term "lure and attraction" and the effect of corn on waterfowl. In his opinion, such feeding can control the movements of birds and hold them in a specific area. After the hunt, the witness went with Ball to locate defendant Orme.
On January 5th and 16th, the farm was surveilled by DNR Agent Darren Moore. Each day he was present for twelve to fourteen hours and was located approximately 300 yards from the Owings residence. He observed the flight patterns of the geese and noted that they came from all directions with their main focal point being the feeding area. The geese would then fly from the feeding area toward the ponds along Jamaica Point Road. He did not observe any standing corn but did see stubble. Moore stated that there were "high concentrations of geese in the area."
John E. Gerber, III, who as noted above is a biologist with CWH, testified that he is familiar with patterns of Canada geese in the area. He stated that his job includes building wildlife habitats. Gerber noted that when birds are under the influence of bagged feed, large numbers concentrate in an area where they would otherwise disperse more widely. Geese become addicted to habitual placement of large amounts of feed. The birds are "lazy." They eat the feed and then go to a fresh water pond to graze. When geese are fed "hot" food like corn they like fresh water. The more grain that is fed, the more birds that are likely to be drawn to a particular site. Initially, Gerber stated that "lure and attraction" meant that the spreading of grain would attract birds to an area they would not otherwise use. He later clarified this by saying that geese would use the area in greater numbers and use it more frequently. Such feeding would influence local flocks of birds. In Gerber's opinion, the entire farm is in jeopardy if the farm is baited because all of it is within the zone of influence of the feeding area. He did admit that some geese would use the farm even if no feeding were taking place. However, the farm would not be used by such large numbers of geese.
Lawrence E. Albright testified that he has hunted on the farm for about seven years and is familiar with the placement of the corn on the farm. Corn has always been put on the Owings' lawn and off the dock. In the beginning, corn was spread daily out of five gallon buckets, but in the last several years it has been spread with a tractor using a spreader. While Albright helped cast the grain until several years ago, the corn is now put out by Orme and Grafton. He indicated that he never felt that such feeding was illegal while he was spreading the corn.
Burton E. Wheedleton, a retired DNR agent, testified that in his opinion, the more geese are fed the more birds they will be attracted. He also noted that Canada geese become "imprinted" in an area when they are fed regularly.
Defendants presented the testimony of Michael E. Turner, a registered professional surveyor, who, as noted above, calculated the distances from the feeding area to the various hunting blinds. His calculations are noted on Def. Orme Exh. No. 1.
Defendant Edgar J. Orme, III, testified that he first became acquainted with Owings in 1962 and that he started hunting on the farm as a guest about twenty-five years ago. *1177 According to Orme, Os added three fresh water ponds and the pond on the point to property in his early years of ownership. Owings "always" left standing corn in the field. "He did everything he could to encourage wildfowl to come to Jamaica Point Farm through the use of crop rotation, etc." Orme paid an annual fee to hunt the farm. In October 1992, Os asked the witness to assist him in spreading the feed. Orme talked to Grafton who agreed to help Owings in return for the right to hunt the farm. The frequency and placement of the corn was controlled by Os. This defendant indicated that the feeding was performed from October 1992 to April 15, 1993. The corn was delivered to the farm in a one ton open bed truck. Prior to the hunt, Orme last spread the corn on January 1st. The last delivery before the hunt in question was on January 18, 1993. Orme admitted that he knows that "geese like corn." On January 20th, Orme, Wallace, Hambleton, Grafton, Bugbee, Chambers, Little and Hornberger were hunting at the ponds. Stone, Fox, the two Dize brothers, Penn, and Floyd were in the ditch in the back field. A total of nineteen hunters were present. Ten geese were killed  eight at the ponds and two in the back field. Orme marked his hunting blind on the morning in question as "C" on Def. Orme Exh. No. 1. This position placed him near the ponds on Jamaica Point Road. He claimed that no one at this blind ever fired a shot and expressed surprise that any expended shells were found in that area. Sometime between the start of the hunt and its termination, Orme stated that he left the farm, went home and changed into business clothes. Later he was phoned by "someone" whom he later met at a restaurant in Easton. The two of them then met defendant Stone. Orme testified that he was not the president of a hunting club he just collected the money and paid Os. He also paid for fertilizer and "some standing corn." Later in his testimony, Orme indicated that he "only collected monies from members of `his club.'" According to the witness, "club members" would call him to make arrangements for a hunt. On January 20th, the Dize brothers and Fox were guests of other club members, Penn was a guest of Orme's, and Stone was a member of the club. Although he testified that he never asked any "wardens" if it was all right to hunt when corn was placed on the farm, Orme stated that he "felt" that he had "official" permission to hunt while the feeding program was in process. Additionally, it was defendant Orme's opinion that "we were far enough removed from the corn to be out of the zone of influence."
The third witness for the defense was George Ray Arnett, a consultant, who was Director of the California Fish and Game Department from 1968 to 1975. Mr. Arnett was also an Assistant Secretary of the Interior under President Reagan from 1981 to 1986. An avid hunter who has hunted throughout the world and is closely connected with numerous organizations, Mr. Arnett stated that he has hunted the farm as many as fifteen times. He always asked if there was any bait present. The witness admitted that he "knew what [Owings] did down by the ponds." In his opinion, Arnett felt that there was no violation of the hunting regulations on Jamaica Point Farm.
Charles S. Conner, a writer, publisher and hunter from Memphis, Tennessee, testified that he has written "extensively" on the issue of baiting especially along the Atlantic flyways. Mr. Conner has been used as a "resource" for the USFWS over the past fifteen years. He has hunted the farm "six or seven times with a gun and twice that with a camera." While he was aware of the "feeding program," Conner had no concerns because "he had no reason to believe that the birds would be lured to the hunting sites." In his opinion the "zone of influence" did not include the blinds on Jamaica Point Farm.
The final witness in this case was defendant Mahlon Dize who testified that he was a guest in a blind in the northwest corner of the farm. He denied having anything to do with the feeding or the baiting.

THE ISSUES
From the government's perspective the only issue in this case is whether or not Jamaica Point Farm was a "baited area." A sub-issue is whether or not the blinds on the *1178 farm were within the "zone of influence" of the bait.
Of course, defendants deny that the farm is a baited area. Further, they claim that even if it is determined to be a "baited area," the blinds used on January 20th were outside the "zone of influence." Other defenses raised include, "somebody else did the baiting, therefore these defendants are `not guilty'"; "entrapment by estoppel"; "prosecution of these defendants would be `unfair'"; and the hunters had "every reason to believe that the program was within the law."[8]
To prove a case against all the defendants for taking or attempting to take migratory birds by the aid of bait or over a baited area, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt (1) that the farm was a "baited area" within the meaning of 50 CFR § 20.21(i); (2) that the defendants took or attempted to take migratory birds over the baited area; and (3) that the birds involved were migratory birds.
All of the defendants, with the exception of defendant Orme, were found in the vicinity of hunting blinds and none denied that they were in fact hunting on January 20th. Thus, the second element is admitted by all defendants. While Orme was not found at the scene, he did admit in his testimony that he had been hunting on the farm the morning of January 20th. Additionally, as none of the defendants pressed the issue of whether or not geese are "migratory" within the meaning of either the statute or the regulations, they have basically conceded this element  as indeed they must. Thus, the only real element in contention under these charges is whether or not the farm was a "baited area."
To convict defendants Orme and Grafton of aiding and abetting, the government must again prove beyond a reasonable doubt that: (1) the farm was a "baited area;" and (2) that these two defendants aided and abetted the other defendants in the taking or attempted taking of migratory birds either by the aid of bait or over a baited area.
Finally, for defendant Orme to be convicted of the lead shot charge, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that while taking or attempting to take migratory birds Orme had such shot in his possession. See 50 CFR § 20.21(j).

THE LAW
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act ["the Act"], 16 U.S.C. §§ 703-711, provides in § 703:
... it shall be unlawful at any time, by any means or in any manner, to pursue, hunt, take, capture, kill, attempt to take, capture, or kill ... any migratory bird ...
The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to promulgate regulations under the Act. Pursuant to that authority the Secretary has issued 50 CFR § 20.21, the primary regulation at issue here. That regulation provides in part:
Migratory birds on which open seasons are prescribed in this part may be taken by any method except those prohibited in this section. No persons shall take migratory game birds:
.   .   .   .   .
(i) By the aid of baiting, or on or over any baited area. As used in this paragraph, "baiting" shall mean the placing, exposing, depositing, distributing or scattering of shelled, shucked, or unshucked corn ... so as to constitute for such birds a lure, attraction or enticement to, on, or over any areas where hunters are attempting to take them; and "baited area" means any area where shelled, shucked, or unshucked corn ... or other feed whatsoever capable of luring, attracting, or enticing such birds is directly distributed, or indirectly placed, exposed, deposited, distributed, or scattered; and such area shall remain a baited area for 10 days following complete removal of all such corn ... However, nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit:
(1) The taking of all migratory game birds, including waterfowl, on or over standing crops, flooded standing crops (including *1179 aquatics), flooded harvested croplands, grain crops properly shucked on the field where grown, or grains found scattered solely as the result of normal agricultural planting or harvesting; and
(2) The taking of all migratory game birds, except waterfowl, on or over any lands where shelled, shucked, or unshucked corn ... or other feed has been distributed or scattered as the result of bona fide agricultural operations or procedures, or as the result of manipulation of a crop or other feed on the land where grown for wildlife management purposes: Provided, That manipulation for wildlife management purposes does not include the distributing or scattering of grain or other feed once it has been removed from or stored on the field where grown[.]

(Emphasis added).

"BAITED AREA"
As noted above, the Secretary's regulations define a "baited area" as:
any area where shelled, shucked, or unshucked corn ... or other feed whatsoever capable of luring, attracting, or enticing such birds is directly distributed, or indirectly placed, exposed, deposited, distributed, or scattered....
50 CFR § 20.21(i).[9] It is clear from this regulation that the feeding of migratory birds is not prohibited per se. Rather the regulation prohibits feeding of migratory birds in a way that lures them to areas where hunters are stationed. Defendants do not seem to dispute that at least a part of the farm  the area around the Owings' residence  would fit the definition of a "baited area" in the regulations. The argument is that the so-called "zone of influence" rule should be applied to the blinds in which they were hunting. "The zone-of-influence rule is apparently not a formal, published rule, but a means of ascertaining or describing in practice the extent of a baited area in a given case." Manning, 787 F.2d at 437. The defense argues that this zone of influence must be calculated with some exactitude and that the distances involved here do not fall within the zone. "It is true that such an area is not subject to exact definition and may expand or contract with changes of wind and weather, but hunters must make many such judgments as these in order to hunt at all." Yandell v. United States, 550 F.Supp. 572, 576 (N.D.Miss.1982), aff'd, 712 F.2d 218 (5th Cir.1983). "The extent of that area `is defined only by the capacity of bait placed anywhere within it to act as an effective lure[.] ... Congress must have intended for the violation to turn on the factual determination that birds are being lured to a hunter's shooting location, no matter how far the bait is from that location[.]'" Manning, 787 F.2d at 437-8 (citing United States v. Chandler, 753 F.2d 360, 363 (4th Cir.1985)) (emphasis added).
Applying these guidelines to the facts of this case, it is clear to the Court that all defendants were taking or attempting to take migratory birds (geese) over a baited area. There is ample evidence, as noted above, from agents who watched the flight patterns of geese over the farm for a period of time that the birds approached the "feeding area" from all directions, that after feeding most geese flew to the freshwater ponds along Jamaica Point Road to drink, graze or rest. If they did not go to the ponds, the geese departed in all directions. This modus operandi was confirmed by John E. Gerber, III, a biologist, whose qualifications as an expert were not challenged. Gerber's testimony that the actions of Owings over the years caused the geese to "imprint" on the farm, and that without the so-called "feeding program" the farm would not be used by such large numbers of birds, is likewise, unchallenged and, the Court finds, most believable.
As far as the distances from the "feed area" to the blinds are concerned, it is true that they might be deemed "considerable." Two factors mitigate against any finding that the blinds were too far away from the bait to be outside the zone of influence. The first is that the patterns described by the witnesses clearly demonstrate that the "feed area" acted *1180 as a lure and attraction to the geese and without the "feed area" geese would not be attracted to the farm. The geese flew toward the blinds after feeding because of the corn in the "feed area." A second factor seems to have been overlooked by the defense. Corn was found along Jamaica Point Road within ninety-eight (98) paces of the ponds. How the corn got there is not a proper inquiry. Neither is who put it there or who knew it was there. See Chandler, 753 F.2d at 363. Certainly a normal pace can be no more than four feet. If that is the case, there was bait within 400 feet of the ponds along the road. Likewise, the distance to hunting site "A" as shown on Def. Orme's Exh. No 1 is approximately halved. The Court finds beyond a reasonable doubt that all the blinds in use on January 20th were within the zone of influence of either the "feed area" around the Owings' residence or the corn found along Jamaica Point Road. Such a conclusion requires a finding of "guilty" as to the charge of hunting over a baited area against all defendants.

AIDING AND ABETTING
To convict defendants Orme and Grafton of aiding and abetting, the government must demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that each of these defendants "knowingly associated himself with and participated in the criminal venture." Flowers v. Tandy Corp., 773 F.2d 585, 590 (4th Cir.1985) (citing United States v. Winstead, 708 F.2d 925, 927 (4th Cir.1983)). It is not necessary for the government to show that the individual defendants participated in every step of the criminal enterprise; it need only "show participation at some stage accompanied by knowledge of the result and the intent to bring about that result." United States v. Arrington, 719 F.2d 701, 705 (4th Cir.1983) (quoting United States v. Hathaway, 534 F.2d 386, 399 (1st Cir.), cert. denied 429 U.S. 819, 97 S.Ct. 64, 50 L.Ed.2d 79 (1976)), cert. denied 465 U.S. 1028, 104 S.Ct. 1289, 79 L.Ed.2d 691 (1984). Of course, if a defendant is convicted as a principal that defendant can not be convicted as an aider and abetter.
As noted above, the facts that the farm was a baited area and that all defendants were indeed hunting over a baited area on January 20th have already been proven. The evidence is also clear that the corn was placed in the "feed area"[10] for the sole purpose of attracting geese; that at least defendant Orme knew the purpose for placing the corn in the "feed area"; and that Orme knew the farm would be hunted during the season. In addition, defendant Orme collected money from the hunters and made "arrangements" for their hunting. This evidence is sufficient for the Court to conclude that Orme is guilty of this offense beyond a reasonable doubt.
Defendant Orme testified that he asked defendant Grafton to assist Os in spreading the corn and that he and Grafton were the only individuals spreading the corn during the period in question. Orme last spread corn on January 1, 1993, before the day of the hunt. Agent Lacey testified that he saw an individual spread corn on January 17th, and took a picture of the individual on the tractor pulling the spreader. See Gov't Exh. No. 10(p). The individual in the picture certainly cannot be identified with particularity. However, Orme and Grafton were the only ones spreading the corn during the period leading up to the hunt and, as he testified, Orme last spread the feed on January 1st. A reasonable inference could be drawn that the person spreading the corn as Lacey watched was defendant Grafton. The Court therefore finds that Grafton did indeed aid and abet in the taking, or attempted taking, of migratory birds over a baited area on January 20, 1993 and is guilty of the offense charged.[11]
*1181 According to the evidence, nineteen hunters were present in the fields on January 20, 1993. Since neither Orme nor Grafton can be convicted for aiding and abetting themselves, especially when each has already been convicted as a principal Orme and Grafton could only aid and abet eighteen hunters. The question arises as to whether an individual can be convicted of aiding and abetting a fellow aider and abetter. Such a result seems illogical. Therefore, the Court finds defendants Orme and Grafton each guilty of seventeen counts of aiding and abetting.

POSSESSION OF LEAD SHOT
Only defendant Orme is charged with taking or attempting to take migratory birds while possessing lead shot. While there is evidence from which the Court could find that Orme was in possession of lead shot on January 20th, the evidence does not persuade beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence is, therefore, insufficient to convict Orme of this charge.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, the Court finds defendants Mahlon A. Dize, Wayne W. Dize, Geoffrey K. Fox, Stephen J. Grafton, Edgar J. Orme, III, Larry W. Penn, and William W. Stone, Sr. guilty of taking or attempting to take migratory birds with the aid of bait. Further, the Court finds defendants Stephen J. Grafton and Edgar J. Orme, III each guilty of seventeen counts of aiding and abetting in the taking or attempting taking of migratory birds with the aid of bait. Finally, the Court finds defendant Edgar J. Orme, III, not guilty of the charge of taking or attempting to take migratory birds while possessing lead shot.
Sentencing for all defendants is scheduled for the 10th day of December, 1993 at 10:00 a.m. in Courtroom 2E, United States Courthouse, 101 West Lombard Street, Baltimore, Maryland. Counsel for defendants Grafton and Orme will be notified when to have defendants Grafton and Orme report for presentence investigation interviews. The Court does not deem such interviews necessary for the other defendants.
NOTES
[1]  A number of others were also charged with violations of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. In those cases, the charges were either dismissed or the individuals forfeited collateral.
[2]  Gov't Exh. No. 2 is an aerial photograph of the farm and the surrounding area. If the photograph is viewed with the notarial seal in the upper left corner of the photograph, Jamaica Point Farm is located in the lower right quadrant. Jamaica Point Road is the tree-lined road running roughly parallel to the right side of the photograph. It meets with Schoolhouse Road which is also tree-lined, runs roughly parallel to the bottom of the photograph, and is perpendicular to Jamaica Point Road. The Manor House is located at the juncture of the two roads. Running from the road juncture towards the bottom right corner of the exhibit is a tree-lined drive leading to the Owings' residence. Straddling the middle of Jamaica Point Road are three ponds. Another somewhat elongated pond lies between the Owings' residence and the river.
[3]  Os Owings was originally a defendant in this case. His death occurred before trial and the case against him was dismissed. However, his presence was felt throughout the trial. Constant references were made to him by various witnesses and portions of a book written by him, entitled "The Wizard Is Os", were submitted into evidence without objection by both the government and defendant Orme. See Gov't Exh. No. 9 and Def. Exh. No. 3. References from the book were corroborated by testimony of various witnesses.
[4]  Both Parker and Thurman are former USFWS agents who retired some years ago.
[5]  The "C" on the map marks the area where Mark J. Komenda, a Maryland Natural Resources policeman, found other hunters on January 20th.
[6]  All of this latter group were among the hunters who forfeited collateral rather than stand trial. Charges were dismissed by the government against the writer and photographer. Some of these individuals are shown in Gov't Exh. No. 10(n). Defendant Orme is shown in Gov't Exh. No. 10(m). Both of these photographs were taken on January 20, 1993 before the hunt was terminated.
[7]  This area is marked by a red line running from "1" to "2" on Gov't Exh. No. 1.
[8]  The Court finds that there is no merit to any of the "other defenses" raised by various defendants and will not address them specifically in this Memorandum and Order.
[9]  The constitutionality of this regulation is not challenged here. Such an attack would be fruitless. See United States v. Manning, 787 F.2d 431, 437 (8th Cir.1986); United States v. Jarman, 491 F.2d 764, 766 (4th Cir.1974).
[10]  There is absolutely no evidence that either Orme or Grafton had anything to do with the placement of corn along Jamaica Point Road on or prior to January 20th.
[11]  It is somewhat troubling to the Court that the government chose to charge Orme and Grafton with aiding and abetting by way of a single violation notice which parenthetically indicates "(18 counts)." See Local Rule 304(1)(i) which states that "[e]xcept in exceptional circumstances, a violation notice or citation shall charge only one offense." It would certainly seem to be a better practice to use an Information which could set out the charges with greater particularity. No objection was filed by either defendant to the charging document and, even if it had, the government could have dismissed the complaint and begun the proceedings again by filing an Information.

BARRY, Circuit Judge

        On November 26, 2001, after a four-day jury trial, appellant Arafat Maswadeh was

convicted of all counts of which he was indicted, including racketeering, 18 U.S.C. §

1952(a)(3), arson, 18 U.S.C. § 844(I), use of fire to commit mail fraud,18 U.S.C. § 844(h),
solicitation to commit arson,18 U.S.C. § 373, conspiracy to commit interstate travel in aid

of the above crimes, 18 U.S.C. § 371, and four counts of mail fraud, 18 U.S.C. §1341. On

May 31, 2002, the District Court sentenced Maswadeh to an aggregate sentence of 360

months imprisonment and five years of supervised release, and ordered that he pay

restitution in the amount of $1,355,358.

        On appeal, Maswadeh argues that the District Court erred in numerous ways at trial

and sentencing, including: (1) not postponing the trial in the wake of the tragic events of

September 11, 2001; (2) denying his motion for an order requiring the government to

produce Giglio or impeachment material more than one week in advance of trial; (3)

denying his motion for judgment of acquittal based on the insufficiency of evidence; (4)

denying his request to allow a particular exhibit to go to the jury room unredacted; (5)

giving him a one-level upward sentence adjustment for being an organizer or leader; (6)

assessing one criminal history point for a sentence of six-months imprisonment upon a

finding of criminal contempt for non-payment of child support; and (7) departing upward

from the otherwise applicable guideline range by eight offense levels based on the effect of

his arson on the community, its economy, and the victims. We have jurisdiction pursuant to

18 U.S.C. § 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and will affirm.




                                                     I.

        As we write primarily for the parties, we recount only those facts necessary to our

                                                     2
decision. This prosecution arose from a fire that decimated half of an entire city block in

downtown Carlisle, Pennsylvania in the early morning hours of December 18, 1999.

Investigators determined that the fire, which destroyed or damaged seven businesses and

sixteen residential apartments leaving 55 people homeless, originated in the New York

Deli, on the ground floor of 48 West High Street, a deli owned by Maswadeh. They also

concluded, after finding two red gasoline containers just inside the back door of the deli,

that the cause of the fire was arson. Maswadeh, a Palestinian Arab and naturalized United

States citizen, was implicated in the arson when some of his co-conspirators, who were

under investigation for dealing drugs out of an apartment above the deli, told federal agents

that Maswadeh had wanted the deli burned in order to collect the insurance money.

        After Maswadeh was indicted for the arson but prior to trial, the District Court held

a hearing on defense counsel’s motions to withdraw as counsel and to revoke the order of

pretrial detention. Maswadeh stated that he had changed his mind and was satisfied with his

present counsel. Defense counsel then informed the Court that he had recommended to

Maswadeh that the trial be postponed to avoid any potential jury bias against Maswadeh

because of his Arab ethnicity or Muslim religion due to the events of September 11, 2001.

Maswadeh, however, expressly told the Court that he did not want to postpone the trial. The

Court observed that it would be willing to do so if Maswadeh should change his mind

before trial. The Court declined to revoke its prior order detaining Maswadeh pending trial.

As part of a later “omnibus” pre-trial motion, Maswadeh moved for an order requiring the

government to provide for early disclosure of impeachment material to the defense. The

                                                     3
Court ordered that the government deliver that material one week before trial, in keeping

with the regular practice of the Court.

        At trial, the primary evidence against Maswadeh was the testimony of his three co-

conspirators: Keith Walker, Alonzo “Pooh” Thornton, and Eric “Joe” Anilus. Thornton,

who lived in New York City but dealt drugs in Carlisle through Anilus and others, testified

that in September of 1999, Maswadeh offered to pay him $20,000 to set fire to the New

York Deli while he was out of the country in Israel. Although Thornton did not follow

through with the fire while Maswadeh was in Israel, he ultimately enlisted Keith Walker, a

drug-addict who also lived in New York City, to set fire to the deli for $1,000.

        Walker, the only other defendant indicted for the arson (Thornton and Anilus having

pled guilty only to drug charges), testified that Thornton took him to Carlisle by bus on

September 17, 1999. He and Thornton were met by Anilus, who took them to the apartment

over the deli at 48 West High Street, where Thornton had previously stashed two containers

of gasoline. Walker waited in the apartment until approximately 3:00 a.m. when he went to

the back door of the New York Deli, pried off some wood panels using a crowbar that

Anilus had given him, and set the fire. He returned to New York by bus the next morning.

Anilus corroborated Thornton and Walker’s testimony at trial. Anilus testified that he was

present at two different times when he heard Thornton and Maswadeh discussing the fire,

that he went to Maswadeh’s house the day before the fire to obtain the crowbar, and that he

showed Walker where the back door of the New York Deli was and paid Walker $600 cash

given to him by Thornton.

                                                    4
        Two other witnesses called by the government included Nadeem Khan, who believed

that he had purchased the New York Deli from Maswadeh and was operating the deli for

several weeks before the fire, and Merle “Gene” Miller, the insurance broker who had

issued the insurance policy on the New York Deli. Khan testified that he had purchased the

deli the month before the fire, and believed that Maswadeh had transferred the insurance to

his name. Miller testified that, in August of 1999, at the request of Khan and Maswadeh, he

had drawn up the necessary papers to transfer insurance coverage to Khan’s name, but in

late August, Maswadeh told him that the sale had fallen through and that the insurance

should remain in Maswadeh’s name.

        Defense counsel cross-examined Miller about a memorandum he wrote after the

fire to the State Auto Insurance Companies, the issuer of the policy, which noted, among

other things, that Khan had put in an immediate claim after the fire and seemed very upset,

while Maswadeh did not contact Miller for two days after the fire, and did not seem very

concerned. The memorandum was admitted as a defense exhibit. At the close of trial, the

prosecution successfully objected to Miller’s memorandum going into the jury room

unredacted because only a small portion of the memorandum had been discussed in trial

testimony. Although the Court expressed a willingness to allow a redacted version to go to

the jury, no such version of the exhibit was ever submitted to the Court by the parties or

sent to the jury.

        Maswadeh’s presentence report calculated an offense level of 26 pursuant to section

2K1.4 of the Sentencing Guidelines because of Maswadeh’s knowing creation of a

                                                    5
substantial risk of death or serious bodily harm with a two level enhancement under section

3B1.1(c) due to Maswadeh’s status as the organizer and manager of the arson. The

presentence report also determined that Maswadeh had four criminal history points,

resulting in a criminal history category of III. One of the criminal history points was based

on Maswadeh’s six-month sentence of imprisonment for contempt of court based on his

failure to pay child support, contempt purged two weeks later when Maswadeh paid the

requisite support. The resulting guideline range was 78 to 97 months for all counts other

than count five, which alleged a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 844(h) with a statutory mandatory

minimum of ten years imprisonment to run consecutively with any other sentence, for a

total potential guideline sentence of 198 to 217 months.

        At sentencing on May 31, 2002, the District Court heard testimony from two

government witnesses: the mayor of Carlisle testified concerning the damage that the fire

had done to the economy of Carlisle and efforts to revitalize the downtown area, and a

resident of one of the burned apartments testified concerning the emotional difficulties her

children had experienced in the two years since the fire. After hearing the arguments of

counsel, the Court added a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice, finding that

Maswadeh had committed perjury when he testified at trial, and also departed upward eight

levels, from an offense level of 28 to an offense level of 36. The Court articulated four

grounds for the eight-level departure, adding two levels for each: (1) the danger posed to

the public was in substantially in excess of that involved in an ordinary arson; (2) the

negative effect the fire had upon the revitalization of historic downtown Carlisle; (3) the

                                                     6
negative effect the fire had on eight downtown businesses resulting in a substantial loss of

property, jobs and tax revenue; and (4) the psychological and emotional trauma suffered by

the 55 residents awakened by the fire in the middle of the night and rendered homeless.

After making these adjustments, the District Court sentenced Maswadeh to 360 months

imprisonment.

                                                     II.

        As an initial matter, all of the arguments Maswadeh advances on appeal other than

those dealing with his sentence are patently without merit. We discern no abuse of

discretion in the District Court’s decision to proceed with trial in November of 2001

where Maswadeh himself informed the Court that he would rather not postpone the trial

despite the Court’s willingness to do so, and where his counsel never moved for a

continuance. Similarly, and wholly apart from the reasons why there should not be a rule of

early disclosure of impeachment material, given that Maswadeh’s counsel concedes that he

cannot show that the government’s delivery of impeachment materials one week before

trial resulted in any prejudice to the defense case, the District Court’s denial of

Maswadeh’s motion for earlier production was not reversible error. Cf. United States v.

Starusko, 729 F.2d 256, 262 (3d Cir. 1984) (late discovery warrants reversal only if it

prejudiced defendant). Also, it was well within the District Court’s discretion, see United

States v. Casoni, 950 F.2d 893, 902 (3d Cir. 1992), to deny Maswadeh’s request to allow

Miller’s lengthy but unredacted memorandum to go to the jury, especially where the

prosecution expressed willingness to allow the jury to have a properly redacted version of

                                                      7
the exhibit.

        As for the sufficiency of the evidence, although Maswadeh notes some minor

inconsistencies in the testimony of his co-conspirators at trial, our independent review of

the record shows that the cross-examinations and closing arguments by the defense made

the jury well-aware of these inconsistencies as well as any possible interest in giving

testimony favorable to the prosecution. Thus, it was well within the jury’s factfinding role,

after weighing the evidence as a whole, to credit the co-conspirators’ testimony. Viewing,

as we must, the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, see United States v.

Rosario, 118 F.3d 160, 163 (3d Cir. 1997), there was ample evidence to allow a reasonable

jury to find Maswadeh guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

        We thus move to Maswadeh’s various objections to his admittedly severe 30 year

sentence. First, he argues that the District Court improperly accepted the presentence

report’s recommendation that he be given a two-level enhancement under section 3B1.1(c)

of the Sentencing Guidelines because he was an “organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor”

of the arson conspiracy. We find this objection without merit. The arson scheme was

conceived by Maswadeh, who recruited accomplices, specified when and how the crime

was to be accomplished, and stood to benefit much more (retaining $150,000 of the

$200,000 in anticipated insurance proceeds) than the other co-conspirators. According to

both the commentary to section 3B1.1 and this Court’s precedent, these actions clearly

clothe Maswadeh as the leader and organizer of the crime for purposes of the enhancement.

See U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1 cmt. 4; United States v. Gricco, 277 F.3d 339, 358 (3d Cir. 2002).

                                                     8
        For his second objection to his sentence, Maswadeh argues that the District Court

erred in calculating his criminal history category. On October 5, 2002, the Court of

Common Pleas of Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, found Maswadeh in contempt of

court for failure to pay child support and sentenced him to six months imprisonment. The

sentence was vacated 15 days later when Maswadeh satisfied his support obligations.

Maswadeh argues that the District Court improperly added one criminal history point for

this six-month sentence for civil contempt because it was not a criminal conviction. We

disagree. The District Court properly included the contempt sentence pursuant to the plain

language of section 4A1.2(c) of the Sentencing Guidelines, which expressly provides for

the inclusion of a sentence for an offense that is “similar” to a list of minor offenses, citing

both “Contempt of Court” and “Non-Support.” U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(c).

        Finally, we address Maswadeh’s contention that the District Court erred in ordering

an eight level upward departure from the otherwise applicable offense level of 28. In

reviewing the District Court’s decision to depart, we must determine whether the factors

relied on by the Court were appropriate and whether the extent of the departure was

reasonable. United States v. Kikumura, 918 F.2d 1084, 1098 (3d Cir. 1990). In other

words, in order for the departure to be justified, Maswadeh’s crime must fall outside the

“heartland” of the typical arson, rendering him culpable in ways not adequately taken into

account by the Sentencing Guidelines. See Koon v.United States, 518 U.S. 81, 98 (1996);

see also 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b) (requiring a sentence in accordance with the guidelines unless

“there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not

                                                       9
adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the

guidelines”). We consider in turn each of the four grounds upon which the District Court

justified the four two-level upward departures.

        The first ground for departure articulated by the District Court was that the arson

involved a “danger to the public that was present to a degree substantially in excess of that

which is ordinarily involved in a case of this type.” While Maswadeh correctly notes that

section 2K1.4(a)(1) of the guidelines already provides for an increase in the base offense

level if the arson created a risk of death or bodily harm to non-participants or destroyed a

dwelling, we cannot conclude that the District Court erred in concluding that the fire

caused by Maswadeh caused an entirely different magnitude of risk to innocent parties

“substantially in excess” of the risks caused by an ordinary arson. See U.S.S.G. § 5K2.0.

Here, the evidence shows that the fire, started in the middle of the night in a building which

contained several residential apartments, and adjacent to buildings which contained several

more residential apartments, created a significant risk of injury and death to more than fifty

innocent individuals including many small children. Accordingly, we will affirm the two-

level upward departure in light of this unconscionable risk caused by Maswadeh.

        The second ground for departure articulated by the District Court was the setback to

the revitalization efforts in downtown Carlisle caused by the irreparable damage to its

downtown historic district. Section 2K1.4(a)(3) of the guidelines only incorporates

consideration of the amount of the loss occasioned by arson if the arson did not create a

risk of death to innocents or destroy a dwelling. Section 5K2.5, however, expressly

                                                    10
authorizes an upward departure where the guidelines do not adequately account for the value

of lost property, particularly when the harm was “knowingly risked” and the extent to which

“the harm to property is more serious than other harm . . . risked by the conduct relevant to

the offense of conviction.” U.S.S.G. § 5K2.5. Given the devastation that the fire visited

upon downtown Carlisle and the dim prospects for redevelopment of the area, the District

Court’s two-level departure on this ground was not error. Cf. United States v. Medford, 194

F.3d 419, 425 (3d Cir. 1999) (authorizing upward departure where intangible value of

cultural objects stolen from museum was not adequately accounted for by market

valuation).

        The ground articulated by the District Court for the third two-level upward departure

was the fire’s destruction of or serious damage to eight downtown businesses, and the

resulting loss of jobs, income and tax revenues. We find that this departure correctly takes

into account the economic effects on local residents and the local economy not adequately

accounted for in the arson guidelines calculation for this extraordinary fire. This

recognition of the effect of the fire not only on the historic downtown, but on the financial

realities of those who lived and worked there, was an appropriate ground for departure not

adequately accounted for by the guidelines.

        Finally, the fourth ground articulated by the District Court for a two-level upward

departure was the psychological and emotional trauma suffered by the individuals awakened

in the middle of the night and rendered homeless by the fire. At sentencing, one of the

individuals who lived above the New York Deli and barely escaped with her life testified

                                                    11
that her three children were in fear and suffered emotional problems in the years since the

fire, a fire in which the family lost everything, including pets. The Court found that all of

the 55 residents displaced by the fire also suffered similar emotional consequences from

the fire and their ensuing homelessness. This emotional devastation to a whole community

of displaced residents also distinguishes this case from a typical arson and justified the

District Court’s final two-level upward departure.

                                                     III.

        For the foregoing reasons, we find no reversible error in the District Court’s rulings

before trial, during trial, or at sentencing. Accordingly, we will affirm Maswadeh’s

conviction and sentence.

                                        State of Nebraska, appellee, v.
                                        William T. Kelley, appellant.
                                                    ___ N.W.2d ___

                                          Filed March 27, 2020.    No. S-19-227.

                 1. Judgments: Jurisdiction: Appeal and Error. Determination of a juris-
                    dictional issue which does not involve a factual dispute is a matter of
                    law, which requires an appellate court to reach its conclusions indepen-
                    dent from those of a trial court.
                 2. Jurisdiction: Appeal and Error. Before reaching the merits of the
                    issues presented for review, it is an appellate court’s duty to determine
                    whether it has jurisdiction to decide them.
                 3. Jurisdiction: Final Orders: Appeal and Error. For an appellate court
                    to acquire jurisdiction of an appeal, there must be a final order or final
                    judgment entered by the court from which the appeal is taken.
                 4. Criminal Law: Judgments: Sentences: Appeal and Error. In a crimi-
                    nal case, the judgment from which the appellant may appeal is the
                    sentence.
                 5. Double Jeopardy: Pleadings: Final Orders. Under Neb. Rev. Stat.
                    § 25-1902 (Reissue 2016), a plea in bar is a “special proceeding,” and
                    an order overruling a nonfrivolous double jeopardy claim affects a sub-
                    stantial right.
                 6. Double Jeopardy. The Double Jeopardy Clause protects against three
                    distinct abuses: (1) a second prosecution for the same offense after
                    acquittal, (2) a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction,
                    and (3) multiple punishments for the same offense.
                 7. Double Jeopardy: Juries: Evidence: Pleas. In Nebraska, jeopardy
                    attaches (1) in a case tried to a jury, when the jury is impaneled and
                    sworn; (2) when a judge, hearing a case without a jury, begins to hear
                    evidence as to the guilt of the defendant; or (3) at the time the trial court
                    accepts the defendant’s guilty plea.

   William T. Kelley appeals the denial of his plea in bar,
in which he claimed that charges that he committed sexual
assaults should be barred because the State agreed not to pros-
ecute him for those charges in a prior plea agreement. Kelley’s
plea in bar did not, however, present a colorable double jeop-
ardy claim. Accordingly, we lack appellate jurisdiction and
have no choice but to dismiss the appeal.
                       BACKGROUND
   In August 2018, Kelley was charged by information with
one count of first degree sexual assault and one count of
third degree sexual assault of a child. Kelley was alleged to
have committed the first degree sexual assault between June
1, 2007, and January 11, 2008. Kelley was alleged to have
committed the third degree sexual assault of a child between
September 1, 2007, and January 12, 2008. The victim of both
crimes was alleged to be T.K.
   Kelley filed a plea in bar. In the plea in bar, he asserted
that in March 2009, he entered guilty pleas to multiple crimi-
nal charges in two different criminal cases. Kelley claimed
that he pleaded guilty to those charges as part of an agree-
ment in which the State agreed not to bring any charges
alleging that he sexually assaulted T.K. Kelley contended
that by filing criminal charges it had previously agreed not
to bring, the State was violating rights guaranteed to him by
the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the federal and the Nebraska
Constitutions.
   The district court held a hearing on Kelley’s plea in bar.
The evidence introduced at the hearing showed that in 2009,
                               - 411 -

                         Cite as 305 Neb. 409

after Kelley had been charged with multiple crimes in two
different criminal cases, Kelley and the State entered into a
written plea agreement. Pursuant to that agreement, Kelley
pleaded guilty to various offenses, the court accepted his
pleas, and he was found guilty and sentenced accordingly.
The written plea agreement did not include a promise by the
State not to prosecute Kelley for alleged assaults on T.K. It
also included a clause that stated, “[t]he parties to this plea
agreement state and acknowledge that this document contains
all of the promises, agreements, and understandings between
the parties.”
   Despite the absence of any indication in the written plea
agreement that the State was agreeing not to charge Kelley
with any charges pertaining to T.K., Kelley claimed that was,
in fact, part of the agreement. In support of that argument,
Kelley called his attorney in the prior criminal cases as a wit-
ness. That attorney testified that an agreement not to prosecute
Kelley for alleged assaults on T.K. was part of the agreement
he reached with the prosecutor and that Kelley’s counsel
had inadvertently omitted it from the written plea agreement.
Kelley also testified and asserted that the “only reason” he
agreed to the plea agreement was the State’s agreement not to
prosecute him for assaults on T.K. The prosecutor in the prior
criminal cases, however, testified that an agreement not to
prosecute Kelley for alleged assaults on T.K. was not part of
the agreement.
   The district court overruled the plea in bar. Kelley appealed.
                  ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR
   Kelley assigns two errors on appeal. He contends that the
district court erred by overruling his plea in bar. He also asserts
that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.
                   STANDARD OF REVIEW
   [1] Determination of a jurisdictional issue which does not
involve a factual dispute is a matter of law, which requires an
appellate court to reach its conclusions independent from those

of a trial court. Griffith v. Nebraska Dept. of Corr. Servs., 304
Neb. 287, 934 N.W.2d 169 (2019).
                           ANALYSIS
   [2] Before reaching the merits of the issues presented for
review, it is our duty to determine whether we have jurisdic-
tion to decide them. See Green v. Seiffert, 304 Neb. 212, 933
N.W.2d 590 (2019). As we will explain, after exercising that
duty here, we find that we do not have jurisdiction.
   [3,4] For an appellate court to acquire jurisdiction of an
appeal, there must be a final order or final judgment entered
by the court from which the appeal is taken. State v. Paulsen,
304 Neb. 21, 932 N.W.2d 849 (2019). In a criminal case, the
judgment from which the appellant may appeal is the sentence.
Id. Kelley has not been sentenced in this case, so we may only
exercise jurisdiction if he has appealed from a final order.
Under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 25-1902 (Reissue 2016), the four types
of final orders which may be reviewed on appeal are (1) an
order affecting a substantial right in an action that, in effect,
determines the action and prevents a judgment; (2) an order
affecting a substantial right made during a special proceeding;
(3) an order affecting a substantial right made on summary
application in an action after judgment is rendered; and (4)
an order denying a motion for summary judgment when such
motion is based on the assertion of sovereign immunity or the
immunity of a government official.
   [5] Kelley contends that our precedent recognizes that an
order overruling a plea in bar is a final order. We have held
that a plea in bar is a “special proceeding,” for purposes
of § 25-1902, and that an order overruling a nonfrivolous
double jeopardy claim affects a substantial right. See State v.
Williams, 278 Neb. 841, 774 N.W.2d 384 (2009). Based on
this reasoning, we have reviewed several cases in which the
trial court overruled a plea in bar, but the defendant presented
a colorable double jeopardy claim. See, e.g., State v. Huff,
279 Neb. 68, 70, 776 N.W.2d 498, 501 (2009) (“[appellant’s]
plea in bar raises a colorable double jeopardy claim, and we

therefore have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal”).
See, also, State v. Bedolla, 298 Neb. 736, 905 N.W.2d 629
(2018); State v. Combs, 297 Neb. 422, 900 N.W.2d 473 (2017);
Williams, supra.
   In this case, however, we find that Kelley has not presented
such a claim. Kelley does assert that the State could not, con-
sistent with the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the federal and
Nebraska Constitutions, charge him with sexually assaulting
T.K. He claims that is the case because the State agreed in the
plea agreement not to do so. He has never, however, explained
why the State’s alleged breach of the plea agreement amounts
to a violation of double jeopardy.
   [6] Not only has Kelley not made an argument that the
Double Jeopardy Clauses preclude the State from charging
him with sexually assaulting T.K., we cannot conceive of a
colorable one. And that is true even if we assume that the
State agreed in the plea agreement not to bring charges against
Kelley alleging that he sexually assaulted T.K. The Double
Jeopardy Clause protects against three distinct abuses: (1) a
second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal, (2)
a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction,
and (3) multiple punishments for the same offense. State v.
Manjikian, 303 Neb. 100, 927 N.W.2d 48 (2019). Nothing in
our record indicates that Kelley has previously been acquitted,
convicted, or punished for sexually assaulting T.K.
   [7] Neither is there anything in our record indicating that
Kelley will be twice placed in jeopardy for sexually assault-
ing T.K. In Nebraska, jeopardy attaches (1) in a case tried to a
jury, when the jury is impaneled and sworn; (2) when a judge,
hearing a case without a jury, begins to hear evidence as to the
guilt of the defendant; or (3) at the time the trial court accepts
the defendant’s guilty plea. Id. As far as our record discloses,
prior to the filing of the information in this case, Kelley had
not ever been charged with sexually assaulting T.K. and pro-
ceedings had certainly not progressed to the point that jeopardy
had attached with respect to such charges.

                        Cite as 305 Neb. 409

   The fact that Kelley has assigned as error on appeal that he
received ineffective assistance of counsel does not change our
analysis. Kelley argues that his counsel in the prior criminal
cases provided ineffective assistance by failing to include lan-
guage in the written plea agreement that the State would not
bring charges against Kelley alleging that he sexually assaulted
T.K. We question whether a party can assert that counsel in a
prior criminal case was ineffective in the context of a plea in
bar, but even if that is set to the side and even if we assume
that Kelley’s ineffective assistance of counsel allegation has
merit, we see no basis to say that rights guaranteed to Kelley
by the Double Jeopardy Clauses have been violated.
   Our decision today should not be read to hold that a defend­
ant has no remedy if the State pursues charges it previously
agreed not to bring as part of a plea agreement. Indeed, we
have previously noted that “when the State breaches a plea
agreement, the defendant generally has the option of either
having the agreement specifically enforced or withdrawing his
or her plea.” State v. Smith, 295 Neb. 957, 972, 892 N.W.2d 52,
63 (2017). But as Kelley’s counsel acknowledged in oral argu-
ment, the only remedy he has pursued is a plea in bar based
on an alleged double jeopardy violation. Because Kelley has
not asserted a colorable double jeopardy claim, however, we
lack jurisdiction to decide anything else and are obligated to
dismiss the appeal.
                        CONCLUSION
   Because Kelley has not presented a colorable double jeop-
ardy claim, the order overruling his plea in bar was not a final,
appealable order. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack
of jurisdiction.
                                            Appeal dismissed.

Before CHAMBERS, HAMLEY and HUFSTEDLER, Circuit Judges.
PER CURIAM:


1
Tevita Tuituiohu Naufahu, a native and citizen of Tonga, seeks review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals denying his application for adjustment of status to that of permanent resident under Section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1255(a).


2
Petitioner entered the United States as a nonimmigrant visitor in 1965.  Upon expiration of his visa, he was ordered to show cause why he should not be deported.  At a deportation hearing in 1967, petitioner conceded deportability but applied for status as a permanent resident.  The application was denied because petitioner was ineligible to receive an immigrant visa.  Later, after petitioner became eligible for a visa, the proceedings were reopened and this time the petition was denied because a visa was not immediately available to him.  Finally, when petitioner met all the preconditions to relief under Section 245(a), the application was again denied for lack of sufficient equities to warrant exercise of administrative discretion under Section 245(a).


3
Petitioner contends on this review that the discretionary denial of his application was based on insufficient evidence.  We have examined the record and conclude that the evidence is sufficient.


4
Petitioner also contends that the Board acted arbitrarily when it invoked the discretionary portion of Section 245(a) at a late date in the proceedings.  However, prior to that time, petitioner had not met certain of the statutory preconditions to a granting of an application under Section 245(a)-- eligibility to receive an immigrant visa and availability of such a visa.  It follows that a determination of whether administrative discretion should be exercised in petitioner's favor was unnecessary at the early stages of the proceedings.  Neither the Board nor the Special Inquiry Officer abused their discretion in reserving that determination until it was necessary in order to dispose of the application.

Jeremiah Royster, Appellant Pro Se.


Unpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.
PER CURIAM:

                Jeremiah Royster seeks to appeal the district court’s

order denying relief on his 28 U.S.C. § 2254 (2006) petition.

The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge

issues      a     certificate            of     appealability.              See     28     U.S.C.

§ 2253(c)(1) (2006).                A certificate of appealability will not

issue    absent         “a    substantial            showing     of    the       denial       of    a

constitutional          right.”            28    U.S.C.       § 2253(c)(2)        (2006).           A

prisoner         satisfies          this        standard       by     demonstrating            that

reasonable        jurists      would          find    that     any    assessment          of       the

constitutional          claims      by     the    district      court       is    debatable         or

wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the district

court is likewise debatable.                         See Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537

U.S. 322, 336-38 (2003); Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484

(2000); Rose v. Lee, 252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir. 2001).                                          We

have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Royster

has   not       made    the    requisite         showing.           Accordingly,         we    deny

Royster’s motion for a certificate of appealability and dismiss

the appeal.            We dispense with oral argument because the facts

and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials

before   the      court       and    argument         would    not    aid    the    decisional

process.

PER CURIAM

      Xue Hua Chen and her daughter Qiao Xia Yang, citizens of China, seek review of

an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”), denying their motion to reopen

proceedings. For the reasons that follow, we will deny the petition.
       Chen and Yang entered the United States without valid documents in January

2004. After being placed in removal proceedings, Chen applied for asylum for having

been forcibly sterilized under China’s population control policy.1 She also applied for

withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture. The

Immigration Judge (IJ) disbelieved much of Chen’s testimony regarding forced

sterilization, found her evidence insufficient to support her claims, denied relief, and

ordered her and her daughter removed to China. The BIA agreed with the IJ’s

conclusions and dismissed the appeal on September 8, 2004.

       On December 7, 2004, the petitioners filed a timely motion to reopen proceedings

with the BIA. Initially, the BIA noted that some of the petitioners’ arguments alleged

error in its prior decision, and stated that to the extent the petitioners sought

reconsideration, their motion was untimely.2 The BIA then considered whether the

petitioners had presented new evidence warranting reopening proceedings, found none,

and denied the motion on September 29, 2005. The petitioners filed a timely petition for

review of the BIA’s decision to deny reopening.




   1
       Yang was a derivative beneficiary of her mother’s applications for relief.
   2
       A motion to reconsider must be filed within thirty days of the BIA’s prior order.
See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). Here, the petitioners’ motion was filed in December 2004,
three months after the BIA’s prior order in September 2004. Contrary to the petitioners’
argument, the BIA committed no legal error in considering whether their motion might be
treated as both a motion to reopen and to reconsider.

                                               2
         We review the BIA’s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion with

“broad deference” to its decision. Ezeagwuna v. Ashcroft, 325 F.3d 396, 409 (3d Cir.

2003); see INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323 (1992) (noting the broad deference due the

BIA’s decision). Under this standard, we will reverse the BIA’s decision only if it is

“arbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.” Sevoian v. Ashcroft, 290 F.3d 166, 174 (3d Cir.

2002). The BIA may lawfully deny a motion to reopen if (1) the alien has not established

a prima facie case for asylum; (2) the alien has not introduced previously unavailable,

material evidence; or (3) in the case of asylum, the alien would not be entitled to relief

even if the motion was granted. Caushi v. Attorney General, 436 F.3d 220, 231 (3d Cir.

2006).

         Here, the BIA concluded that the petitioners presented no previously unavailable

evidence. After reviewing the record, we cannot find any abuse of discretion in this

regard. Notably, the petitioners arrived in January 2004. Apparently Chen made no

effort to obtain medical evidence to support her claim of forced sterilization until October

2004, after the BIA dismissed her appeal. According to the doctor who examined her on

November 4, 2004, a “simple and inexpensive” procedure known as a

hysterosalpingogram would have supported her claim. (A.R. at 22.) This evidence,

which Chen still has not obtained, does not constitute evidence that “was not available

and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.” 8 C.F.R.

§ 1003.2(c)(1); see Caushi, 436 F.3d at 232.



                                               3
      In sum, we find no basis to conclude that the BIA abused its discretion in denying

the petitioners’ motion to reopen. Accordingly, we will deny their petition for review.

TERENCE T. EVANS, Circuit Judge.


1
In this case, filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Gail Anderson alleges that Milwaukee County and Milwaukee Transport Services, Inc., the operator of the Milwaukee County bus system, violated her First and Fourteenth Amendment rights by their "tariff," which prohibits the distribution of literature on county buses.


2
Ms. Anderson, a woman in her mid-fifties, lives in Milwaukee. She doesn't drive a car and so is a regular customer on Milwaukee's buses. But she is not, it would appear, your typical bus rider. As anyone who rides buses in urban communities knows, most passengers mind their own business. Most avoid conversation, and many even avoid eye-contact, with other passengers. Not Ms. Anderson. She (here, of course, we take her allegations as true) has a "sincerely held religious belief" and a wish to "share her faith with those sitting next to her on the bus by talking to them and giving them religious literature." She also wants to give her literature to other passengers who pass by her seat on the bus. It's unclear just how long, and how often, she has followed her urge to share her views with other riders.


3
Ms. Anderson's urge to "share her faith" and the bus company's tariff collided on July 8, 2003. On that day, she boarded a bus and took a seat near the front. From there, she attempted to hand out copies of a book, later identified as "The Book of Hope." The book contains stories from the Bible. In the past, she says she has been allowed to hand out the book on the bus, but this time the driver, Rozell Smith, observed what she was doing and asked her to stop. Despite repeated requests, Ms. Anderson did not stop and, in fact, said, "I will not stop." At this point, Smith did not know the book contained religious material.


4
Because Ms. Anderson refused to stop handing out copies of her book, Smith called the transit system dispatch office. He spoke to dispatcher Valdis Salmins. The transcript of the call is as follows:


5
Operator: ... 63 on 63, bus 4442, badge 2637.... OK, I want the company rules on passing out literature on the bus, there. I'm sure we have some kind of regulation, there. Is that possible for people to pass out literature, all different types of literature, over?


6
Dispatch: That's a negative. There is no solicitation of any kind allowed on our buses. (S0) whether it's free or for charge or what-ever.... Nothing is to be given out on the buses.


7
Operator: Well, that's affirmative on that. I thought that was a rule. I got a lady on here who's passing out books on the bus, annoying the passengers, and I told her that she couldn't do that. She told me I couldn't stop her from doing that, over.


8
Dispatch: Ok, I'll send the CPOs to intercept you. If she gets off before you're intercepted, please give us a call back.


9
Operator: Roger.


10
Mr. Salmins called system security. The transcript of that call:


11
CPO: CPO 8, dispatch ... we're in the downtown area, what do you have?


12
Dispatch: EB from 107th and Silver Spring, I have vehicle 4442, 63 on 63, badge 2037. Female on board trying to hand out booklets. I don't know if they're religious or political, or what, but no solicitation allowed on our buses whatsoever.


13
Two security officers intercepted the bus, boarded it, approached Ms. Anderson, and asked whether they could talk to her off the bus. At that point, they did not know what she was handing out. After she was off the bus, Ms. Anderson told the officers about "The Book of Hope." The officers explained to her that the Transit System had a rule against distributing literature on buses. They asked her whether she wanted to board the next bus to continue her trip. Being within six blocks of her home, she decided to walk.


14
The "rule" discussed by the bus driver and the dispatcher is one of the "Passenger Tariffs," under which the bus system operates. The tariffs set out fare information and rules regarding passenger conduct. Tariff 116 says "No person furnished transportation under fares named in this tariff shall be permitted to enter or remain in the system's buses: (a) For purpose of distributing any form of advertising or literature." Based on these facts, the district judge (the Honorable Lynn Adelman) granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment. Ms. Anderson now appeals, claiming that the tariff is impermissibly vague, overbroad, and unreasonable. She also claims it discriminates against religious literature. We review a summary judgment determination as well as any questions of constitutional law under the de novo standard of review. Weinberg v. City of Chicago, 310 F.3d 1029, 1035 (7th Cir.2002).


15
We will turn first to Ms. Anderson's claims that the tariff, on its face, is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The tariff is vague, she says, because it is unclear what "distributing" means. She poses several hypothetical examples. For instance, is handing out one book distributing? A bus company witness said no. But, she asks, is handing out one item a day for more than one day considered distribution? How about the businessman who hands a seat mate his business card? Her examples of the outer limits of possible meanings of the word "distributing" fall short of convincing us that the tariff is unconstitutionally vague. Common sense must not be and should not be suspended when judging the constitutionality of a rule or statute.


16
A law is void for vagueness if it fails to give fair warning of what is prohibited, if it fails to provide explicit standards for the persons responsible for enforcement and thus creates a risk of discriminatory enforcement, and if its lack of clarity chills lawful behavior. Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972). On the other hand, the Court has said that "perfect clarity and precise guidance have never been required even of regulations that restrict expressive activity." Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 794, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989). There are, of course, limits to how precise language can be in the context of a law, ordinance, or, for that matter, a bus system tariff. In United States Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548, 578-79, 93 S.Ct. 2880, 37 L.Ed.2d 796 (1973), the Court remarked that "there are limitations in the English language with respect to being both specific and manageably brief...." Looking at the Civil Service Rules interpreting the then-existing version of the Hatch Act, 5 U.S.C. § 7324(a)(2), the Court said the "ordinary person exercising ordinary common sense" knows perfectly well what they mean.


17
Ms. Anderson's arguments that the tariff is vague are reminiscent of those in Schultz v. Frisby, 877 F.2d 6, 8 (7th Cir.1989), which involved abortion opponents who wished to picket the home of an abortion provider.1 The plaintiffs claimed that an ordinance which outlawed picketing that was "directed at" a particular home was unconstitutionally vague. We set out their concern:


18
Will it be enough to go `round and `round the block? Could the picketers march in front of the five houses on either side of the [providers']? May they stop for one minute, or two, or five, in front of the ... place before moving along? Surely they can't evade the law by standing in front of the... home and occasionally jumping one house on either side. How much longer must the route be?


19
We rejected these concerns in favor of common sense:


20
No matter how clear the ordinance seems, a hundred nice questions may follow in its wake. The Constitution does not require [the town] to answer each of these before it may enforce the law. Incompleteness is a curse of language, as of human imagination. To say that precision is a precondition to enforcement is to say that no ordinance regulating speech may stand—a proposition the Supreme Court has rejected over and again.


21
Id. In our case, we cannot imagine that the tariff would have a chilling effect, for instance, on a bus-riding businessman who wanted to hand his business card to a seat mate. In short, we do not find the ordinance unconstitutionally vague.


22
Neither can the tariff be seen as facially overbroad. The overbreadth doctrine allows a plaintiff to ask that a law be struck down based not on how it affects the plaintiff but on how it might be applied to third parties not before the court. Because that is "strong medicine," the "overbreadth of a statute must not only be real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep." Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 614-615, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973). Again, in Virginia v. Hicks, 539 U.S. 113, 123 S.Ct. 2191, 156 L.Ed.2d 148 (2003), the Court emphasized that to be overbroad, the law's application to protected speech must be substantial. That simply is not the case here. The tariff is narrowly drawn and applies—as we shall see—in a limited environment. More importantly, Ms. Anderson has not shown that the tariff would significantly affect the rights of individuals not before us in any way differently from the way it affects her. Accordingly, as the Court said in City Council v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 802, 104 S.Ct. 2118, 80 L.Ed.2d 772 (1984), "It would therefore be inappropriate in this case to entertain an overbreadth challenge to the ordinance."


23
Ms. Anderson's primary contention is that to the extent the tariff prevents her from sitting on the bus and handing out literature, it is unconstitutional as applied to her. We agree that her activities are a form of speech protected under the First Amendment. Further, the bus is a governmentally controlled forum. But, it is well-settled that the government is not required to permit all forms of speech on all of the property it owns. Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672, 112 S.Ct. 2701, 120 L.Ed.2d 541 (1992). We use "forum analysis" to determine when the government's interest in limiting the use of its property to its intended purpose outweighs the interests of those wishing to use the property for other purposes, such as First Amendment activities. Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985). Under this approach, on property that has traditionally been available for public expression, regulation of speech is subject to the highest scrutiny. Similarly, the government is bound by the same standard in the "designated public forum"—property the government has opened up for limited or unlimited public expressive activity. Finally, there is the "nonpublic forum"; that is, "[p]ublic property which is not by tradition or designation a forum for public communication...." Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators' Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 46, 103 S.Ct. 948, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983). As Ms. Anderson properly concedes, the interior of a city-operated transit vehicle is a nonpublic forum. See Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U.S. 298, 94 S.Ct. 2714, 41 L.Ed.2d 770 (1974).


24
In a nonpublic forum, the government may restrict speech to a greater extent than in a public or designated public forum. Restrictions must be viewpoint-neutral and reasonable. In other words, restrictions need only pass the test of reasonableness so long as they are not an attempt to stifle a viewpoint based on its content. Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee at 683, 112 S.Ct. 2701. A restriction does not need to be "the most reasonable or the only reasonable limitation"; it does not need to be narrowly tailored; nor does the governmental interest need to be compelling. Cornelius at 808-809, 105 S.Ct. 3439. In fact, simple common sense is sufficient to uphold a regulation under reasonableness review. United States v. Kokinda, 497 U.S. 720, 734, 110 S.Ct. 3115, 111 L.Ed.2d 571 (1990). Using this approach, the Court has found reasonable, for instance, a ban on soliciting in an airport terminal, Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, and a restriction on political advertising on public transit. Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights. See also Children of the Rosary v. City of Phoenix, 154 F.3d 972 (9th Cir.1998). In Chicago Acorn v. Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority, 150 F.3d 695, 704 (7th Cir.1998), we found that leafleting should not be permitted in places where "pedestrian traffic will be obstructed." See also Hawkins v. City and County of Denver, 170 F.3d 1281 (10th Cir.1999).


25
Here, the restriction is clearly reasonable. Bus passengers are a captive audience. While riding on the bus, many passengers have an interest in avoiding unwelcome communications. It is reasonable for the bus company to attempt to ensure their comfort. In Lehman, the Court concluded that a city was entitled to protect unwilling viewers against intrusive advertising on its buses in order to provide rapid, convenient, pleasant, and inexpensive public transportation for them. It is also reasonable to wish to avoid disagreements among passengers which the distribution of literature might inspire. Furthermore, the bus company has an interest in passenger safety. The company expresses concern that a driver could be distracted by literature distribution and that abandoned literature can cause a safety hazard and certainly a littering problem. Given the nature of the forum, a ban on the distribution of literature on buses passes constitutional muster.


26
Finally, Ms. Anderson also seems to claim that the restriction as applied in this case is, in fact, content-based and therefore unconstitutional. She says there is an "unwritten scheme" by which there are exceptions from the total ban on literature distribution—exceptions which arise out of the discretion bus operators have to choose which people they will ask to stop distributing literature. She says that discretionary enforcement of the tariff results in discrimination against religious literature; therefore, the tariff is subject to strict scrutiny analysis. We see no factual basis for this claim. As we said, at the time the driver asked her to stop passing out her book, he had no idea what it was about. Neither did the security officers who took Ms. Anderson off the bus. Furthermore, Ms. Anderson offers no evidence that anyone has been allowed to distribute nonreligious literature on the bus. Her main support for her claim that enforcement is discriminatory is that the bus company has a rack behind the driver's seat which holds copies of bus route schedules and monthly newsletters. She says that if the company can provide that literature, she can pass out her book. We reject this contention out of hand. The comparison between passively providing bus riders with schedules and information about the very system on which they are riding cannot be compared to a passenger distributing literature of any kind. Ms. Anderson's argument on this point rests on thin air.


27
Ms. Anderson has failed in her attack on the tariff, and accordingly we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.

1
Appellant "Carlos Reyes" was convicted of making a false statement to a government agent, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a), after he gave a false name, date of birth, and social security number to a federal law enforcement officer interviewing him for "booking" purposes after his arrest on drug conspiracy charges. Appellant now claims that he was arrested without probable cause and that the officer who booked him violated the familiar warnings requirements established in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). We affirm his conviction.

I. BACKGROUND

2
The findings of fact proposed by the magistrate judge, and adopted by the district court, accurately reflect the evidence, and we summarize them briefly.

A. Investigation and Arrest

3
On April 22, 1999, Special Agent Uri Shafir of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA") reported to the scene of a traffic stop near Kennebunk, Maine. A consent search of the stopped vehicle was performed, and 5.75 ounces of cocaine were found behind the vehicle's dashboard. The search also revealed a list of names and phone numbers that were subsequently identified as belonging to known or suspected drug dealers, including Paul Golzbein of 116 Ross Road in Old Orchard Beach, Maine. The driver of the vehicle, Renee Omar Rosa-Santos, was arrested and later released on bail.


4
On April 28, 1999, Special Agent Gerard Lee Hamilton, Jr., of the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency ("MDEA") and another agent were surveilling the property located at 116 Ross Road in Old Orchard Beach when Hamilton saw Golzbein, who he recognized from previous law enforcement contacts, enter the house. Approximately one hour later, Hamilton saw a rented van pull into the driveway of the house. A man closely resembling Rosa-Santos got out of the driver's-side door, reached down to retrieve a dark-colored package from under the front of the vehicle, and then got back into the driver's seat. A few minutes later, the man entered the house. Another man left the house a few minutes later and entered a trailer on the property. The man resembling Rosa-Santos left the house a few minutes thereafter, sat in the van for a few moments, and then also entered the trailer. After as little as thirty seconds, the man resembling Rosa-Santos exited the trailer, sat in the van again for several minutes, and then drove away.


5
Hamilton conducted surveillance of the Ross Road property again on May 7, 1999. On that date, he saw a black extended cab pickup truck pull into and park in the driveway of the house. Three Hispanic-looking men were inside the truck -- a driver and two passengers, one of which was appellant. After a minute or two, a woman known to Hamilton as Golzbein's girlfriend came out of the house and spoke briefly to the driver before going back inside. The driver of the truck got out and went to the door of the house, where he again spoke with the woman. He then returned to the truck and sat inside with the two passengers, looking around the area. Shortly thereafter, Golzbein drove into the driveway and parked next to the truck. The woman came out of the house and met Golzbein by the pickup truck. All five individuals, including appellant, then entered the house.


6
Two or three minutes later, the driver of the truck came out of the house to stand by the truck; he looked around briefly and then reached under the truck about two feet in front of the rear left tire. He withdrew a baseball-sized object and stuffed it down the front of his pants. Another truck entered the driveway, and the woman motioned for the first driver to enter the house while she spoke with the driver of the second truck for a couple of minutes outside. The woman and the second driver then entered the house together. After several minutes, the second driver left the house.


7
About three minutes later, the three men from the first truck exited the house. Appellant and the other passenger got into the cab of the pickup while the driver went to the front of the vehicle and again reached underneath it. The driver then got in the truck and sat for several minutes looking around before driving out of the driveway.


8
Hamilton informed Shafir that the truck was leaving the Ross Road address, and Shafir followed it until it was stopped by local law enforcement officers. Shafir then reached under the front of the vehicle and removed a black bag containing approximately two ounces of cocaine. No other contraband was found in the vehicle or on the truck's occupants, who spoke to each other in Spanish before all being arrested. Appellant was charged with conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine, although this charge was later dismissed on the government's motion.

B. Booking of Appellant

9
After his arrest, appellant was taken to the local police station in Old Orchard Beach. Walter Smith, an agent of the Immigration and Naturalization Service ("INS") assigned to work with the DEA, interviewed appellant for the purpose of "booking" him, i.e., obtaining the information required by the DEA's standard personal history form for administrative purposes. Because the police station had no separate booking room, the interview was conducted in a detective's office.


10
Before initiating the interview, and having determined that appellant did not speak or understand English, Smith read to the appellant the standard Miranda warning, in Spanish, from the Miranda card that Smith carries at all times and, according to his testimony at the subsequent evidentiary hearing, has used as many as one thousand times to inform detained individuals of their Miranda rights in Spanish. Expert testimony given at the evidentiary hearing later indicated that Smith's pronounced American accent made his reading of the Miranda rights in Spanish difficult to understand. However, at the interview, when asked in Spanish whether he understood the rights read to him by Smith, appellant replied that he did. Smith did not proceed to seek a waiver of appellant's Miranda rights; he testified at the evidentiary hearing that he had no intention of substantively questioning appellant, but intended only to obtain the standard required booking information. Smith also informed appellant at this time that lying about the information he was going to ask him for would be a crime. Smith testified at the evidentiary hearing that he so informed the appellant because he suspected that appellant was not a United States citizen and might be in the United States unlawfully.


11
Smith then proceeded to ask appellant, in Spanish, for the information required on the personal history form. Appellant told Smith that his name was Carlos Reyes, and that he was born in Bayamoon, Puerto Rico on August 27, 1950; he also gave Smith a Social Security number. Smith did not ask appellant any questions other than those required by the standard personal history form -- nothing about the offense for which appellant had been arrested, nothing about criminal activity in general, and nothing about his immigration status other than the routine information specifically required by the personal history form. At the conclusion of the interview, which lasted less than five minutes, Smith photographed and fingerprinted the appellant and returned him to his cell. Smith had no further contact with appellant.

C. Lower Court Proceedings

12
Although the drug conspiracy charge against appellant was dropped, appellant was ultimately charged in a one-count indictment of making false statements in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001. The indictment alleged that the name, date of birth, and social security number given by appellant were not in fact his.


13
Before trial, appellant moved to suppress his allegedly false statements to Agent Smith. Appellant argued that the statements should be suppressed because they were obtained pursuant to an arrest that lacked probable cause and because they were obtained in violation of Miranda.


14
The magistrate judge conducted an evidentiary hearing on September 13, 1999. Based on the testimony given there, and also on other evidence properly admitted, the magistrate judge concluded and recommended to the district court that the motion to suppress should be denied, because the arrest was supported by probable cause and because the questions asked by Smith were subject to the "booking exception" to Miranda's warning requirement. See United States v. Reyes, Crim. No. 99-45 (D. Maine filed Sept. 16, 1999) (Cohen, M.J.). The magistrate judge's recommendation was adopted by the district court on October 29, 1999. The district court noted that it had made a de novo determination on all matters and concurred with the magistrate's conclusions despite an error by the magistrate concerning the appropriate basis for sustaining the officers' determination of probable cause. See United States v. Reyes, Crim. No. 99-45 (D. Maine filed Oct. 29, 1999) (Hornby, C.J.).


15
A jury convicted the appellant of violating 18 U.S.C. § 1001 on November 9, 1999, and appellant was immediately sentenced to "time served." He now appeals his conviction and the denial of his motion to suppress.

II. LAW AND APPLICATION

16
Appellant makes the same arguments before us that he made to the magistrate judge and to the district court. Our review is plenary, see United States v. Meade, 110 F.3d 190, 193 (1st Cir. 1997) (plenary review for probable cause determination); United States v. Shea, 150 F.3d 44, 47 (1st Cir. 1998) (de novo review of district court's application of Miranda), and we have independently examined the record with care. Based on that independent review, we agree with the conclusion of the lower courts and affirm the denial of the motion to suppress and appellant's conviction.


17
A. Appellant's Arrest Was Supported By Probable Cause


18
As the magistrate judge correctly stated in his recommendation, we determine whether an arrest was supported by probable cause using a "totality of the circumstances" standard. See United States v. Torres-Maldonado, 14 F.3d 95, 105 (1st Cir. 1994). Under this standard, the government bears the burden of establishing that, at the time of the arrest, the facts and circumstances known to the arresting officers were sufficient to warrant a reasonable person in believing that the individual had committed or was committing a crime. See id. We note that this does not require the government to present evidence sufficient to convict the individual, but merely enough to warrant a reasonable belief that he was engaging in criminal activity. See id.


19
We agree with the magistrate judge and the district court that the officers who arrested appellant had probable cause to do so. While it is established law that "a person's mere propinquity to others independently suspected of criminal activity does not, without more, give rise to probable cause," Ybarra v. Illinois, 444 U.S. 85, 91 (1979), the known circumstances tying appellant to the drug conspiracy for which he was arrested were substantially more than a "mere propinquity" to another suspect. Unlike in Ybarra, where the defendant was arrested based solely on his presence in a public place (a tavern), appellant here was seen in a private vehicle and entering and exiting a private residence with known and suspected drug dealers. While this association might not alone give rise to probable cause, the officers were plainly reasonable in considering it, because "[w]e do not think officers in the field are required to divorce themselves from reality or to ignore the fact that 'criminals rarely welcome innocent persons as witnesses to serious crimes and rarely seek to perpetrate felonies before larger-than-necessary audiences.'" United States v. Martnez-Molina, 64 F.3d 719, 729 (1st Cir. 1995). We think that such characterization is particularly appropriate where the criminal activity (in this case, a suspected criminal conspiracy) takes place in the small and private confines of a pickup truck cab or a residential dwelling. In this case, we are persuaded that the officers were reasonable in believing that appellant's presence during and participation in such suspicious activities as the orchestrated entrances into and exits from the house, and the minutes spent in the truck looking around, were nether innocent nor ignorant. The government's evidence is especially compelling given the fact that the driver of the pickup truck stood in front of the vehicle and reached under it, in a way consistent with prior suspected drug activity observed by Hamilton at the Ross Road address, while appellant was sitting in the cab not more than four or five feet away and facing in that direction. Under the totality of the circumstances, therefore, we conclude that the officers had probable cause to arrest him for conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine.


20
B. Appellant's Statements Were Not Obtained in Violation of Miranda


21
As the Supreme Court has recently reaffirmed, statements made by a criminal defendant while in police custody are admissible evidence at his subsequent trial only if the defendant was first warned that he has "'the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires.'" Dickerson v. United States, 120 S. Ct. 2326, 2331 (2000) (quoting Miranda, 384 U.S. at 479). Once a defendant is informed of these rights, he may of course waive them, see United States v. Palmer, 203 F.3d 55, 60 (1st Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 2756 (2000), but if he does not do so, the police are prohibited from interrogating him and any statements obtained in violation of this rule will be excluded from evidence at trial, see United States v. Ortiz, 177 F.3d 108, 109 (1st Cir. 1999).


22
The United States concedes that Agent Smith did not obtain a Miranda waiver from appellant before interviewing him for the purpose of completing the personal history form, although he did read appellant his Miranda rights. Appellant's contention is that, absent such a waiver, his statements were obtained in violation of Miranda and should have been excluded from evidence at his trial. The government responds, however, that appellant's statements were obtained lawfully because the questions asked by Smith fall within the established "booking exception" to Miranda's warning requirements. See United States v. Doe, 878 F.2d 1546, 1551 (1st Cir. 1989). Appellant concedes, in turn, that the questions may in a generic sense fall within the scope of the booking exception, but argues that his statements were nonetheless unlawfully obtained because the exception does not apply "where the law enforcement officer, in the guise of asking for background information, seeks to elicit information that may incriminate." Id. Although phrased in terms of the officer's intention, the inquiry into whether the booking exception is thus inapplicable is actually an objective one: whether the questions and circumstances were such that the officer should reasonably have expected the question to elicit an incriminating response. See id.


23
Under the circumstances, we conclude that Agent Smith's questions to appellant -- requesting his name, date of birth, and social security number -- fall within the booking exception to Miranda's warning requirement. We think it significant that Smith asked only those questions indicated on the standard DEA booking form, with no reference whatsoever to the offense for which appellant had been arrested. The booking interview was conducted separate from any substantive interrogation, by a different officer and in a separate room at a separate time, just as we suggested in Doe would be typical of legitimate, routine booking interviews. See id. Although the record does reflect that Agent Smith suspected that appellant might not be a United States citizen, Smith explicitly disavowed at the evidentiary hearing any intention to question the appellant beyond what was necessary to complete the personal history form.


24
Furthermore, we think that it would be a rare case indeed in which asking an individual his name, date of birth, and Social Security number would violate Miranda. We can imagine situations, of course, that would present a closer case than this one. For example, asking a person's name might reasonably be expected to elicit an incriminating response if the individual were under arrest for impersonating a law enforcement officer or for some comparable offense focused on identity; likewise, asking an individual's date of birth might be expected to elicit an incriminating response if the individual were in custody on charges of underage drinking; and questions about an individual's Social Security number might be likely to elicit an incriminating response where the person is charged with Social Security fraud. In such scenarios, the requested information is so clearly and directly linked to the suspected offense that we would expect a reasonable officer to foresee that his questions might elicit an incriminating response from the individual being questioned. In contrast, the appellant here was being booked on charges of participating in a criminal drug conspiracy, to which his name, date of birth, and Social Security number bore no direct relevance.


25
We also recognize that individuals under arrest, particularly those who are in fact guilty of some criminal activity, may sometimes feel tempted to lie about even such basic facts as their identities (to which name, date of birth, and social security are all incidental). Law enforcement agents, through their experience, may often be aware of such temptations, and they may even harbor suspicions in some cases that a particular individual is about to lie. However, we cannot ask them to therefore forego all routine procedures and detain an individual without knowing anything about him, not even what to call him in the jail log. In this particular case, the booking officer went so far as to remind the appellant that it would be a crime to give false answers to the booking questions. That warning, together with the Miranda warnings, seem to us sufficient and reasonable precaution on the part of the officer, and hardly indicative of an intent to obtain incriminating statements by sidestepping the requirements of Miranda.1


26
In sum, we agree with the magistrate judge and the district court that Agent Smith's questions to appellant fall squarely within the booking exception to Miranda's warning requirement.

III. CONCLUSION

27
For the reasons set forth above, we affirm appellant's conviction and the denial of his motion to suppress evidence.


28
Affirmed.

 Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.


1
 Although our "booking exception" analysis completely disposes of appellant's claim, we also consider it noteworthy that this case does not present the danger of coercion that the Miranda warnings were designed to prevent. See, e.g., Miranda, 384 U.S. at 457, 458. The evidence showed that appellant was comfortable during his booking interview and showed no hesitation in his responses to Agent Smith's questions. Furthermore, the booking interview was conducted in accordance with the procedure that we suggested in Doe would be typical, "where one officer may book a suspect in one room before another questions the suspect at greater length elsewhere." Doe, 878 F.2d at 1551. And the circumstances of appellant's interview certainly stand in sharp contrast to those surrounding the questioning of the defendants in Doe, who were rescued from a sinking vessel on the high seas, chained to the deck of a coast guard vessel, and questioned as to the critical jurisdictional fact of their citizenship before any Miranda warnings were given to them. See id. at 1548, 1550-51.

LINDER, J.
In this case, defendant was charged with reckless driving, which is a misdemeanor.[1] In his ensuing jury trial, defendant asked the trial court to instruct the jury on the elements of careless driving, which is a traffic violation, arguing that it is a lesser-included offense of reckless driving.[2] The trial court declined to give defendant's requested instructions. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed. State v. Swanson, 237 Or.App. 508, 240 P.3d 63 (2010). The Court of Appeals reasoned that violations and crimes are distinctive categories of offenses *46 and, under ORS 136.465, juries are authorized to consider only lesser-included crimes, not lesser-included violations, of a charged crime. Id. at 511, 240 P.3d 63. That understanding of the legislature's intent was reinforced, the court concluded, by substantial procedural differences between violation proceedings and criminal proceedings, including the requirement that violations be "tried to the court sitting without jury." ORS 153.076(1); see Swanson, 237 Or.App. at 513, 240 P.3d 63 (so stating). We allowed defendant's petition for review. As we will explain, we agree that ORS 136.465 does not extend to lesser-included violations and is, instead, limited to lesser-included criminal offenses. We therefore affirm.
ORS 136.465 provides:
"In all cases, the defendant may be found guilty of any crime the commission of which is necessarily included in that with which the defendant is charged in the accusatory instrument or of an attempt to commit such crime."
(Emphasis added.) As the italicized text emphasizes, the statute expressly refers to any "crime" the commission of which is necessarily included in the charged crime. The term "crime" is not defined in the statute itself, or in any statute that specifically cross-references ORS 136.465. It is defined, however, elsewhere in the criminal code. In particular, ORS 161.515 provides: "A crime is an offense for which a sentence of imprisonment is authorized." ORS 161.515. The term "offense," in turn, is defined as "either a crime, as described in ORS 161.515, or a violation, as described in ORS 153.008." ORS 161.505. Under ORS 153.008,[3] an offense is a violation if, inter alia, it is designated as such or is punishable by a fine but not by a term of imprisonment. Thus, under those statutes, "violations" and "crimes" are distinct types of "offenses," distinguished principally by the fact that crimes are punishable by imprisonment and violations are not. Because they are distinct types of offenses, the fact that a statute uses the term "crime" (as does ORS 136.465) and not the term "violation" would seem at first blush to compel a conclusion that the legislature intended the statute to reach crimes but not violations. In the context of ORS 136.465, that would mean that a crime that is lesser-included offenses of a crime with which a defendant is charged may be submitted to a jury, but a lesser-included violation may not, as the Court of Appeals concluded. Swanson, 237 Or.App. at 511, 240 P.3d 63.
Defendant concedes that, if those definitions of "violation" and "crime" apply, then ORS 136.645 did not permit the jury to consider a charge of careless driving in this case. He takes issue, however, with the conclusion that those definitions apply. Defendant's argument resolves into two propositions: (1) when ORS 136.465 was originally enacted, the term "crime" included offenses that were punishable only by fines and would therefore be denominated today as a "violation;" and (2) that the original scope of ORS 136.465 has remained the same, and has been unaffected *47 by more recently enacted definitions of the term "crime" that apply to other statutes in the criminal code.
In interpreting a statute, the court's goal is to determine the legislature's intent. State v. Gaines, 346 Or. 160, 171, 206 P.3d 1042 (2009). In doing that, we look to the intent of the legislature that enacted the statute, and we also consider any later amendments or statutory changes that were intended by the legislature to modify or otherwise alter the meaning of the original terms of the statute. See, e.g., Holcomb v. Sunderland, 321 Or. 99, 105, 894 P.2d 457 (1995) (proper inquiry in interpreting statute focuses on what the legislature intended at the time of enactment); see also Mastriano v. Board of Parole, 342 Or. 684, 696, 159 P.3d 1151 (2007) (examining post-enactment legislative changes to statute and statutory context to determine whether they reflected a legislative intent to alter the meaning of statute as originally enacted). As we will explain, we are not persuaded that ORS 136.465, as originally enacted, would have applied to what qualifies as a violation under our current criminal code. In all events, as we will further explain, we are satisfied that later comprehensive changes to the criminal code were intended to, and did, alter the meaning of the term "crime," as it is used in statutes throughout the code, including ORS 136.465, to exclude violations.
We begin with defendant's first propositionthat, as originally enacted, ORS 136.465 applied to offenses that, because they were punishable only by a fine, would today be designated as "violations." As defendant correctly observes, our state's original "lesser-included offense" statute was part of the 1864 Deady Code and was essentially identical in its wording to ORS 136.465. In particular, the Deady Code statute permitted a jury to consider any lesser-included "crime" of the offense with which the defendant was charged.[4] At that time, "crimes" were either "felonies" or "misdemeanors," and the two categories of crimes were distinguished solely by how they were punished. A "felony" was a crime that was punishable by death or imprisonment, and "[e]very other crime [was] a misdemeanor." General Laws of Oregon, Crim. Code, ch. I, §§ 2, 3, 4, pp. 441-42 (Deady 1845-1864).
Defendant compares that classification scheme to that of our current criminal code, under which, as we have described, an "offense" is either a "crime" or a "violation," depending on whether it is punishable by a term of imprisonment (making it a crime) or by a fine but not a term of imprisonment (making it a violation). Defendant asserts that what is, under the current scheme, a violation punishable solely by a fine would qualify as a "crime" under the 1864 version of the lesser-included offense statute.
Defendant's premiseand particularly his assessment of the category of offenses now denominated as "violations"may overlook other distinctions between current-day violations and Deady Code-era crimes. To be sure, one distinguishing characteristic of a violation is the fact that only a fine, and not imprisonment, may be imposed for the offense. But the distinctive nature of a violation goes beyond that. Violations under our current criminal code are charges that have been "decriminalized." A determination of guilt for such an offense cannot carry criminal consequences of any sort, as the legislature has expressly declared: "Conviction of a violation does not give rise to any disability or legal disadvantage based on conviction of a crime." ORS 153.008(2). For that reason, prosecutions for violations are not subject to the constitutional procedural protections that are required for crimes. See, e.g., ORS 153.076(1), (2), and (5) (violation proceedings shall be tried to the court sitting without jury; charged violation must be proved by a preponderance, rather than a reasonable doubt, standard; defense counsel shall not be *48 provided at public expense); see generally Easton v. Hurita, 290 Or. 689, 697, 625 P.2d 1290 (1981) (discussing constitutional implications of decriminalizing traffic infractions); Mattila v. Mason, 287 Or. 235, 250, 598 P.2d 675 (1979) (same); Brown v. Multnomah County Dist. Ct., 280 Or. 95, 99-110, 570 P.2d 52 (1977) (same). In short, violations under the current classification system, given their noncriminal nature and the different procedures that apply to them, had no counterpart under the Deady Code.[5] That fact undermines defendant's premise that a violation under our current criminal code would have been a "crime" for purposes of the original lesser-included offense statute that was part of the Deady Code in 1864.
However, even accepting defendant's premise for purposes of our analysis, his argument depends on a second proposition that later legislation has not changed the meaning and scope of the term "crime" as it is now used in ORS 136.465. As we will explain, we conclude that when the legislature comprehensively revised the Oregon Criminal Procedure Code, of which ORS 136.465 is a part, it did so intending the general classification system that it had adopted in its 1971 revisions to the Oregon Criminal Code to control, including the definitions of terms such as "crime" and "violation."
As we earlier noted, "crime" is defined in ORS 161.515 as follows:
"(1) A crime is an offense for which a sentence of imprisonment is authorized.
"(2) A crime is either a felony or a misdemeanor."
That definition was adopted in 1971 as part of a complete revision of Oregon's criminal code. Or. Laws 1971, ch. 743, § 66. The revision, which was spearheaded by a legislatively-appointed Oregon Criminal Law Revision Commission, was the culmination of a years-long project to replace the existing criminal code, which was "replete with overlapping and seemingly inconsistent crimes and penalties[,]" with one that was modern and "internally consistent." Commentary to Criminal Law Revision Commission Proposed Oregon Criminal Code, Final Draft and Report, Foreword, XXII (July 1970). The new definition of the term "crime," along with other new definitionsof "offense," "felony," "misdemeanor," and "violation"was an essential component of a new offense classification scheme that grouped and punished offenses according to their seriousness. Id. at Foreword, XXIII.
Notably, the 1971 Oregon Criminal Code was an overhaul of Oregon's substantive criminal law, and did not amend the statutes pertaining to criminal procedure, including ORS 136.465. Relying on that fact, defendant argues that, in the absence of any suggestion in the 1971 statute to the contrary, we must assume that the statute's narrower definition of the term "crime" was intended to apply only to the use of the term within the 1971 Criminal Code and to have no effect on its meaning in statutes outside that code, such as ORS 136.465. Defendant also relies on the notion that, in general, a definition of a term that appears in one area of the Oregon Revised Statutes does not necessarily control the term's meaning in another area. See, e.g., Enertrol Power Monitoring Corp. v. State of Oregon, 314 Or. 78, 84, 836 P.2d 123 (1992) (so stating); State ex rel. Frohnmayer v. Oregon State Bar, 307 Or. 304, 308 n. 2, 767 P.2d 893 (1989) (same).[6]
*49 Defendant may be correct that the 1971 adoption of a new definition of the term "crime" had no direct effect on the meaning of that term in ORS 136.465, which pertains to criminal procedure. However, he is less persuasive when confronting the effects of the 1973 enactment of the Oregon Criminal Procedure Code. Or. Laws 1973, ch. 836, §§ 1-359. Although the 1973 procedural code did not modify the words of ORS 136.465 in any significant way,[7] it is clear from the legislative history of the 1973 code that the drafters intended to import into that code the 1971 Criminal Code definitions of "crime," "offense," and "violation."
The 1973 Criminal Procedure Code and the 1971 Criminal Code were closely linked. Both codes were drafted by the Oregon Criminal Law Revision Commission, which the 1967 legislature created for the purpose of "prepar[ing] a revision of the criminal laws of this state, including but not limited to necessary substantive and topical revisions of the law of crime and of criminal procedure, sentencing, parole and probation of offenders, and treatment of habitual criminals." Or. Laws 1967, ch. 573, §§ 1, 2. The commission undertook that charge by first revising the substantive criminal laws and "defer[ring] work on a procedural code until completion of [that] phase of the project." Commentary to Criminal Law Revision Commission Proposed Oregon Criminal Code, Final Draft and Report, Foreword, XXIV (1970). As soon as the commission completed its work on the substantive code in 1970 and the legislature enacted that code in 1971, the commission turned to the criminal procedural code revision. Thus, the commission's work on the procedural code was an extension of its recently completed effort on the substantive code.
As the commission considered additions and amendments to the procedural statutes, it applied the definitions that it had drafted, and that the legislature had adopted, in the 1971 Criminal Code.[8] For example, when the commission considered certain procedural statutes pertaining to arrest, it decided to change the word "crime" to "offense" in a number of the statutes to make it clear that a person could be arrested (or criminally cited in lieu of arrest) for violations as well as misdemeanors and felonies. Minutes, Criminal Law Revision Commission, July 24, 1972, 34-36, 40. In the course of the same discussions, a member of the commission suggested that the use of the word "crime" in ORS 133.225, pertaining to the authority of private persons to make citizen's arrests, "was intentional and it should not be changed to `offense.'" Id. at 40. In at least one of the commission's discussions of the arrest statutes, the 1971 Criminal Code was explicitly acknowledged as the source of the relevant definitions of the term "crime." Minutes, Criminal Law Revision Commission, Subcommittee No. 1, June 9, 1972, 2. The commission had similar discussions about whether to use "offense" or "crime" with respect to the statutes governing stops by police officers[9] and the statutes governing arraignment and demurrers.[10]
*50 During those discussions, the commission considered whether, and how, to change the original (1864) wording of ORS 136.465 (then numbered ORS 136.660). After a brief consideration of that statute, the commission produced an amended version that nonetheless continued to use the term "crime."[11] Although the commission did not specifically discuss whether to keep or modify the term "crime" in the lesser-included offense statute, the context of its discussions makes clear that the commission understood, in leaving it, that the term would carry the meaning given to it in the 1971 Criminal Code. Generally, the legislative history indicates that the commission and, later, the legislature, intended the term "crime," including when it was used in ORS 136.465, to have the meaning that it was given in the 1971 Criminal Code through the definition in ORS 161.515.
We conclude that the jury's authority, described in ORS 136.465, to find a defendant guilty of "any crime the commission of which is necessarily included in that with which the defendant is charged," extends only to a crime as that term is defined in ORS 161.515an offense "for which a sentence of imprisonment is authorized," i.e., felonies and misdemeanors. The offense for which defendant sought lesser-included treatmentcareless drivingis not a "crime" within the meaning of that definition. It follows that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's request for a jury instruction on careless driving as an offense necessarily included in the crime charged, and that the Court of Appeals did not err in affirming the trial court's denial.
The decision of the Court of Appeals and the judgment of the circuit court are affirmed.
NOTES
[**]  Landau, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.
[1]  See ORS 811.140 (setting out elements of reckless driving and providing for punishment as a Class A misdemeanor).
[2]  See ORS 811.135 (setting out elements of careless driving; designating offense as either a Class A or Class B traffic violation, depending on the circumstances of the offense; authorizing a sentence that includes a fine, but not authorizing a term of imprisonment).
[3]  ORS 153.008 provides:

"(1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, an offense is a violation if any of the following apply:
"(a) The offense is designated as a violation in the statute defining the offense.
"(b) The statute prescribing the penalty for the offense provides that the offense is punishable by a fine but does not provide that the offense is punishable by a term of imprisonment. The statute may provide for punishment in addition to a fine as long as the punishment does not include a term of imprisonment.
"(c) The offense is created by an ordinance of a county, city, district or other political subdivision of this state with authority to create offenses, and the ordinance provides that violation of the ordinance is punishable by a fine but does not provide that the offense is punishable by a term of imprisonment. The ordinance may provide for punishment in addition to a fine as long as the punishment does not include a term of imprisonment.
"(d) The prosecuting attorney has elected to treat the offense as a violation for purposes of a particular case in the manner provided by ORS 161.566.
"(e) The court has elected to treat the offense as a violation for purposes of a particular case in the manner provided by ORS 161.568.
"(2) Conviction of a violation does not give rise to any disability or legal disadvantage based on conviction of a crime."
The parties agree, and ORS 811.435 establishes, that careless driving is a "violation." The question that remains is whether a "violation" is within the meaning of the term "crime," as it is used in ORS 136.465.
[4]  Thus, the original statute provided:

"In all cases, the defendant may be found guilty of any crime the commission of which is necessarily included in that with which he is charged in the indictment, or of any attempt to commit such crime."
General Laws of Oregon, Crim. Code, ch. XVII, § 164, pp. 468-69 (Deady 1845-1864). The change from the original "indictment" wording to the present "accusatory instrument" wording occurred in 1973, as part of a complete revision of the criminal procedure code. Or. Laws 1973, ch. 836, § 244.
[5]  In 1864, certain misdemeanors and lesser felonies could be prosecuted in "Justices' Courts" rather than circuit courts, following different procedures than the circuit courts followed. For example, criminal matters were initiated in Justices' Courts by means of a private complaint, rather than an indictment, and were prosecuted by the private complainant. All criminal prosecutions in Justices' Courts, however, were triable to a jury under the same criminal procedures that applied in the Circuit Courts. See generally General Laws of Oregon, Jus. Code, ch. I, § 2, p 583 (describing criminal jurisdiction of Justices' Courts); id. at ch X, §§ 78-105, pp. 597-602 (describing procedures in criminal actions in Justices' Courts). There was no concept of an offense that, due to its noncriminal nature, could be prosecuted in any court in the state without the procedures and protections constitutionally required in criminal cases.
[6]  Defendant also cites a provision in the 1971 revision through which the legislature disavowed an intent to affect statutes governing criminal procedure:

"Except as otherwise expressly provided, the procedure governing the accusation, prosecution, conviction and punishment of offenders and offenses is not regulated by this act but by the criminal procedure statutes."
Or. Laws 1971, ch. 743, § 6(1). That provision, however, is directed at the procedures themselves, not the meaning of words common to both substantive and procedural statutes. That provision has no application here.
[7]  The 1973 statute made a single modification to ORS 136.465 (then codified as ORS 136.660): the term "accusatory instrument" was substituted for the original term "indictment." Or. Laws 1973, ch. 836, § 244.
[8]  The commission was composed largely of sitting legislators and was charged by the legislature with revising Oregon's criminal statutes. In numerous cases, we have looked to the minutes of its deliberations as well as its published commentary on the revised code as an authoritative source of legislative history for the 1973 Criminal Procedure Code. See, e.g., State v. Conger, 319 Or. 484, 493 n. 4, 878 P.2d 1089 (1994) (considering commentary to code); State v. Hitt, 305 Or. 458, 462, 753 P.2d 415 (1988) (considering both minutes of commission meetings and official commentary to criminal procedure code); State v. Dyson, 292 Or. 26, 33-34, 636 P.2d 961 (1981) (same); State v. Mendacino, 288 Or. 231, 236 n. 4, 603 P.2d 1376 (1980) (relying on minutes of commission meetings).

CHALLENGE CREAM AND BUTTER ASSOCIATION, Plaintiff and Respondent,
v.
ROYAL DUTCH DAIRIES, Defendant and Appellant.
Civ. No. 26444. 
California Court of Appeals. Second Dist., Div. One.  
Feb. 13, 1963.
 A. P. G. Steffes for Defendant and Appellant.
 Knapp, Gill, Hibbert & Stevens and Karl K. Roos for Plaintiff and Respondent.
 WOOD, P. J.
 Appeal by defendant Royal Dutch Dairies from an order denying its motion to discharge a writ of attachment. (A motion of defendants Veldhuis and Hilarides, individually, as copartners doing business as Firestone Dairies, to discharge writ of attachment [as to them] was granted.)
 On March 30, 1961, defendant Royal Dutch Dairies assigned its assets to defendant Richard M. Durall for the benefit of creditors. The assignee, Durall, conducted the business of Royal Dutch Dairies about nine months (until December 26) when the assignor (Royal Dutch Dairies), pursuant to court order in another action, took possession of the assets then held by the assignee. During the last month that Durall was acting as assignee he purchased milk from the plaintiff herein, Challenge Cream and Butter Association.
 The present action, in which the writ of attachment was issued, is to recover $22,927.92 for milk sold by plaintiff to the *903 assignee, and to recover $101.09 representing the amount of an unpaid check drawn by the assignee.
 The affidavit for attachment stated that defendants are indebted to plaintiff in the sum of $23,029.01 "upon an implied contract" for the direct payment of money, to wit: reasonable value of goods sold and delivered.
 The sheriff attached the place of business of Royal Dutch Dairies, including furniture, equipment, and milk processing machinery.
 Prior to the assignment, Royal Dutch Dairies, a corporation, was engaged in the retail business of selling milk which it had purchased at wholesale prices from Firestone Dairies, a partnership, the members of which were defendants Ray Veldhuis and Peter Hilarides.
 When the assignment was made to Durall by Royal Dutch Dairies, the directors of that corporation were Ray Veldhuis, president, Peter Hilarides, secretary, and Durall (who was then the attorney for the corporation).
 The assignment provided, among other things, that the assignee should hold the assets in trust and reduce them to money as soon as that could prudently be done, or to continue the business, whichever in the judgment of the assignee would be best calculated to net the best returns for the creditors; that any contract made by the assignee in connection with the trust shall not be binding upon him in his personal capacity, "but shall bind said assignment estate and the assignee in his representative capacity."
 The assignee continued to purchase milk from Firestone Dairies until November 23, 1961, at which time he began purchasing milk from plaintiff, Challenge Cream and Butter Association.
 On November 2, 1961, in an action commenced by Durall (case no. 779497, Superior Court, Los Angeles County), he, upon filing a $10,000 bond, obtained a preliminary injunction restraining Royal Dutch Dairies, Veldhuis, and Hilarides from doing certain acts which allegedly interfered with the business which he, as assignee, was conducting. On December 4, 1961, upon a motion of the parties thus restrained, an order was made in said case (no. 779497) that the injunction be dissolved on December 8, 1961, unless Durall filed a bond in the amount of $125,000. He did not file the bond. On December 26, 1961, in an action commenced by Royal Dutch Dairies apparently for the purpose of rescinding the *904 assignment (case no. 728893, Superior Court, Los Angeles County), it (Royal Dutch), upon filing a $165,000 bond, obtained a preliminary injunction restraining Durall from withholding possession of the assets of said business. On said date, Royal Dutch took possession of the assets. (The references in this paragraph to the two other cases are based upon the original files in the county clerk's office, which files were considered by the trial judge, as stated in his memorandum opinion.)
 The first three of the six causes of action in the complaint are to the effect that Durall is indebted to plaintiff. The first cause of action is based on a written contract between plaintiff, as seller of milk, and Durall, the assignee, as purchaser; and it is to recover $22,927.92 for milk sold to the assignee between November 22 and December 26, 1961. The second cause of action is to recover $101.09 upon a dishonored check which was drawn by the assignee. The third cause of action alleges that between said dates, at the special instance and request of the assignee, the plaintiff sold to the assignee dairy products of the agreed value of $22,927.92.
 [1a] The fourth cause of action alleges that the assignee's purchases of dairy products, as alleged in the first cause of action, were for the use and benefit of defendant Royal Dutch Dairies; that said defendant received the benefit of said purchases in that it sold said products to its customers and has received and now retains the revenue derived from said sales; that although plaintiff demanded that defendant Royal Dutch Dairies pay $22,927.92, the reasonable value of said milk products, and that it pay $101.09, the amount of the dishonored check, it has refused to pay any part thereof; that by reason of said premises, the defendant Royal Dutch Dairies has been unjustly enriched in the amount of $23,029.01.
 The fifth cause of action alleges that on December 26, 1961, defendants Veldhuis and Hilarides, individually, and as co-partners doing business as Firestone Dairies, and defendant Royal Dutch Dairies, took possession and control of the assets of Royal Dutch Dairies by reason of a preliminary injunction restraining Durall from interfering with said defendant's possession, and since said date said defendants have retained possession of said assets from which the amount of $23,029.01, now due to plaintiff from Durall, as assignee, could have been paid.
 The sixth cause of action alleged that defendant New *905 Hampshire Insurance Company had obligated itself as surety for Durall for the benefit of plaintiff.
 This action was commenced on January 31, 1962.
 On February 8, 1962, Royal Dutch Dairies made a motion to discharge the writ of attachment on the grounds that: the writ was issued improperly; plaintiff's purported cause of action against said defendant is not founded upon a contract, express or implied; it appears from plaintiff's first three causes of action against Durall, as assignee, that plaintiff sold all milk pursuant to plaintiff's contract with Durall, and that title to the milk passed exclusively to him; Durall at all times was acting as the purported assignee for the benefit of creditors, but he, in obtaining the milk from plaintiff, was not acting for the benefit of Royal Dutch Dairies, and was acting adversely to it; plaintiff sold milk to Durall over the repeated objections of Royal Dutch Dairies; all the milk was delivered to Durall while he was in possession of the premises of Royal Dutch Dairies adversely to its claims; when Royal Dutch Dairies was restored to possession of its premises, it had filed a $165,000 bond to indemnify Durall, as assignee, against any damage he might sustain by reason of the injunction.
 The affidavit of Ray Veldhuis, in support of the motion to discharge the writ, stated in part: That before plaintiff (Challenge) began selling milk to Durall, he (Durall) had obtained a restraining order which deprived Royal Dutch of possession of its premises, and during the time it was deprived of possession, the defendant Durall was conducting the business in his own name and as the sole proprietor. Durall retained all the proceeds from milk delivered to him by Firestone Dairies. The defendants, other than Durall, objected to the sale of milk by plaintiff to Durall. When Durall discontinued buying milk from Firestone he owed $5,337.42 to Firestone for milk delivered, and at a later date he gave a check to Firestone for that amount but the bank refused payment thereof because insufficient funds were on deposit. All money which was on the premises when Royal Dutch repossessed the business was used to pay accrued wage claims, and Royal Dutch did not obtain any property belonging to plaintiff.
 The affidavit of George E. Atkinson, in support of the motion to discharge the writ, stated in part: He is the attorney for Veldhuis, Hilarides, and Royal Dutch. On November 21, *906 1961, Durall as assignee served notice of cancellation of his contract to purchase milk from Firestone. Thereupon, affiant told Mr. Hibbert, one of the attorneys for plaintiff, that Durall was acting as assignee for the benefit of the creditors of Royal Dutch, that there was serious controversy between the assignee and the assignor, that the assignee had not paid Firestone for milk, and that if plaintiff sold milk to him it (plaintiff) might not be paid. Later, Mr. Hibbert informed affiant that plaintiff had decided to enter into a contract to sell milk to Durall, as assignee. On December 4 affiant caused a written notice (notice by Royal Dutch of rescission of assignment--marked exhibit A and attached to affidavit) to be served on plaintiff, but plaintiff did not reply to the notice. None of the milk sold by plaintiff to Durall, as assignee, was used for the benefit of Royal Dutch, and no revenue from the sale of such milk was received by Royal Dutch. (The written notice, exhibit A, which was given to plaintiff by Royal Dutch, was in substance that the authority of Durall to act as assignee of Royal Dutch had been rescinded.)
 The affidavit of defendant Durall, in opposition to the motion to discharge the writ, stated in part: The creditors of Royal Dutch included 86 unsecured creditors. Since the assignment, Veldhuis and Hilarides have followed a course of harassment and threats to force affiant to sell the assets of Royal Dutch to them for less than a fair price. After Royal Dutch had posted the bond ($165,000 bond) in its action against Durall, he (affiant) was willing for Royal Dutch to go into possession of the assets as constructive trustee for affiant, but he expected that the current obligations would be paid from the assets. Royal Dutch has not paid the current obligations, although it has collected approximately $75,000. When Royal Dutch took possession, Veldhuis, as president, received about $1,500 cash from affiant, and received milk of the approximate value of $3,000, and received current accounts receivable in the amount of $32,269.69, of which amount at least $27,000 was from sale of milk delivered by plaintiff (Challenge). On January 26, 1962, affiant received from Hilarides an offer to buy the assets of Royal Dutch for $331,100. On January 31 affiant accepted the offer, but Hilarides has not purchased the assets.
 Another affidavit of Ray Veldhuis was in substance a denial of the statements in Durall's affidavit, except that Veldhuis stated that Hilarides did make an offer to buy the assets, *907 but that the offer was made because Durall had represented to the court that by reason of the injunction (in favor of Royal Dutch) he would be prevented from selling the assets for $331,000. That Hilarides offered to purchase all the property for a greater amount ($331,100).
 Appellant's contention or points on appeal are in substance the same as its statement of grounds for the motion to discharge the writ. It (Royal Dutch) argues the sale was to Durall; there was no relationship of debtor and creditor between it and plaintiff (Challenge); the first three causes of action show that the contract was solely with Durall; the fact that the fourth and fifth causes of action resemble common counts does not confer upon plaintiff a right of attachment; any claim of plaintiff that there was an implied contract with Royal Dutch is disproved by the first three causes of action wherein it is alleged that the milk was sold and delivered to Durall; appellant was not unjustly enriched when it was restored, pursuant to a preliminary injunction, to assets claimed by it.
 The first three causes of action allege that Royal Dutch made an assignment to Durall for the benefit of its creditors. It is true that those causes of action are directed only against the assignee, and are based upon the written contract between Challenge (plaintiff) and the assignee. An argument of appellant (Royal Dutch) seems to be that since Challenge has a cause of action against the assignee upon the express written contract, there cannot be liability on the part of the assignor upon a theory of implied contract arising from circumstances connected with the transaction. The fourth and fifth causes of action also allege that Royal Dutch made an assignment to Durall for the benefit of its creditors. These causes of action are to the effect that the purchases by Durall, the assignee, were for the use and benefit of the assignor (Royal Dutch), which received the benefit thereof in that it sold said milk products and retained the revenue derived therefrom; that the assignor has been unjustly enriched; and that the assignor, pursuant to court order, has taken possession of the assets which were in possession of the assignee, and from which assets the amount due to Challenge could have been paid. Under the assignment the assignee was authorized to continue the business, and it was further provided therein that any contract made by the assignee in connection with the business should "bind the assignment estate." The assignee *908 continued or operated the business and made the contract under which he created the indebtedness to Challenge. It appears from the fourth and fifth causes of action and the affidavits that the assignor Royal Dutch rescinded its assignment for the benefit of creditors and took possession of the assigned assets and other assets which accumulated during the operation of the business by the assignee. In so taking possession of such assets for its own benefit, it is presupposed, for the purposes of this motion, that Royal Dutch not only accepted the benefit of the Challenge contract (which, according to the assignment, bound the "assignment estate"), but also accepted the detriment of it, or obligation to pay the reasonable value of the milk. In viewing the affidavits in the light favorable to the order of the trial court, it appears, for the purposes of this motion, that Royal Dutch, in so taking possession of the assets, received about $1,500 from Durall, and also received Challenge milk and accounts receivable from sale of Challenge milk (by the assignee) of the approximate value of $30,000; and thereby Royal Dutch was unjustly enriched.
 [2] In Major-Blakeney Corp. v. Jenkins, 121 Cal.App.2d 325, 339-340 [263 P.2d 655], it was said: "[T]he gravamen of a quasi-contractual action grounded on unjust enrichment is the equitable principle that a person should not be allowed to enrich himself at the expense of another. [Citations.] It presupposes the acceptance and retention of a benefit by one party with full appreciation of the facts, under circumstances making it inequitable for the benefit to be retained without payment of the reasonable value thereof."
 [1b] In the present case the trial court could properly conclude that the fourth and fifth causes of action, as against appellant (Royal Dutch), were upon an implied contract for the direct payment of money. Section 538 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that a writ of attachment may be issued in an action upon such a contract.
 [3] An issue as to the extent of a defendant's liability, if any, may not be determined on a motion to discharge a writ of attachment. (See Minor v. Minor, 175 Cal.App.2d 277, 280 [345 P.2d 954]; Rose v. Pearman, 163 Cal.App.2d 480, 484 [329 P.2d 501].)
 [4] Appellant asserts further that the affidavit for a writ of attachment was defective and insufficient to justify the issuance of the writ, for the reason the "subscribed and *909 sworn to" certificate signed by Marguerite E. Lavery does not show that she was a notary public or other person authorized to administer an oath. It is true that the words "Notary Public" do not appear in writing in connection with the certificate, and it is true that the portion of the seal as shown on the photostatic copy of the affidavit in the clerk's transcript does not show that she is a notary public. The imprint of the seal on the original affidavit in the superior court file shows the following words: "Marguerite E. Lavery Notary Public Los Angeles Co. Cal." The affidavit was sufficient.
 The order is affirmed.

Certiorari Granted (People) December 19, 1988.
KELLY, Chief Judge.
The defendant, Narcisco G. Castenada, was found guilty by a jury of aggravated robbery in violation of § 18-4-302(1)(b), C.R.S. (1986 Repl.Vol. 8B), but was found not to have "used, or possessed and threatened the use of, a deadly weapon during the commission of ... [a] robbery" within the meaning of § 16-11-309(2)(a)(I), C.R.S. (1986 Repl.Vol. 8A). Relying on Robles v. People, 160 Colo. 297, 417 P.2d 232 (1966), he argues that the verdict and finding are inconsistent, and he seeks reduction of the verdict to simple robbery and re-sentencing, or a new trial. We reverse and remand to the trial court for re-sentencing.
One morning in 1985, the defendant entered a Denver parking lot, approached the attendant, and ordered him to remove the cash from the cash drawer and put it in an empty plastic cup the defendant had placed on the counter. With one hand in his jacket pocket, he said, "I have a gun." He then asked for and received the attendant's parka. Leaving the cup and money on the counter, the defendant fled the scene with the parka. He was apprehended several hours later wearing the parka. It was not established by the evidence that he was actually in possession of a gun at the time of the robbery.
Jury consideration of the aggravated robbery and crime of violence counts was bifurcated by the trial court. The jury first returned its verdict of guilty on the aggravated robbery count and was then given separate instructions for consideration of the crime-of-violence count. It returned a finding that the defendant "did not use or possess and threaten the use of, a deadly weapon during the commission of the crime of Aggravated Robbery."

I.
The People argue that the aggravation element in § 18-4-302(1)(b), C.R.S. (1986 Repl.Vol. 8B) is not the same as the violent crime element of § 16-11-309(2)(a)(I), C.R.S. (1986 Repl.Vol. 8A) authorizing sentence enhancement. The contention is that a charge of aggravated robbery does not require evidence of actual use or possession of a deadly weapon, while a charge of commission of a violent *643 crime does require such proof. We disagree.
While the aggravated robbery statute does not explicitly require possession by a defendant of a deadly weapon, the plain language of § 18-4-302(1)(b) carries that strong implication. Thus, the statute states that:
"A person ... is guilty of aggravated robbery if during the act of robbery...:
(b) He[,] ... by the use of force, threats, or intimidation with a deadly weapon knowingly puts the person robbed ... in reasonable fear of death or bodily injury...."
Moreover, the General Assembly has provided further, in § 18-4-302(2), C.R.S. (1986 Repl.Vol. 8B):
"[A]ny verbal or other representation by the defendant that he is then and there [armed with a deadly weapon], is prima facie evidence under subsection (1) of this section that he was so armed."
We regard this statutory language as dispositive of the issue. Were it possible to obtain a conviction of aggravated robbery without a showing that the defendant was armed with and in possession of a deadly weapon, this statutory presumption would not have been necessary. It is our obligation to harmonize and to give effect to all the provisions of a statute. People v. District Court, 713 P.2d 918 (Colo.1986).
Accordingly, we reject the People's argument that, because the only evidence that the defendant possessed a gun was his verbal and manual communications, the jury could consistently convict him of aggravated robbery and yet find that he had not committed a crime of violence. A conviction for aggravated robbery requires proof that the defendant placed the victim in fear with a deadly weapon. The People proved this element of aggravated robbery by relying on the presumption contained in § 18-4-302(2). However, if the jury was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that all of the elements of aggravated robbery were present, it could not also consistently find that the defendant did not possess a deadly weapon, thereby exonerating him of the commission of a violent crime.
Here, we must conclude that, since the jury returned the specific negative finding on the violent crime count, it was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that all the elements of aggravated robbery were present. Our conclusion is fortified by the absence of instruction to the jury informing it of the statutory presumption. Since the evidence supports a conviction of simple robbery, however, we need not require a new trial, but rather have the option of reducing the grade of the crime to the lesser offense.

II.
We also reject the People's argument that any inconsistencies in the findings are irrelevant because one statute deals with the substantive crime, while the other is merely a sentence enhancer. An accused person must be found to have committed the substantive offense before the provisions of § 16-11-309(2)(a)(I), C.R.S. (1986 Repl.Vol. 8A) apply. Brown v. District Court, 194 Colo. 45, 569 P.2d 1390 (1977). If the elements of the substantive offense and the sentence enhancer are the same, as here, the verdicts must be consistent if based on the same facts. See Robles v. People, supra. The inconsistent findings in this case are based on the same facts.

III.
The People also argue that a jury is not obliged to return a consistent finding on a violent crime count, since it may accord lenience to the defendant as to the sentence enhancer. The jury here was not instructed that a finding that the defendant committed a violent crime related to the sentence only. Indeed, it would be reversible error to do so.
Sentencing is the exclusive province of the court with which, absent a contrary statute, the jury has no concern. Saleen v. People, 41 Colo. 317, 92 P. 731 (1907). The sole function of the jury as to the crime of violence adjudication is to return the fact-finding required by the statute.
*644 The judgment of conviction of aggravated robbery is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the trial court with directions to enter a judgment of conviction of simple robbery, and to impose sentence for that offense.

STATE of North Carolina
v.
George TURMAN.
No. 8112SC33.
Court of Appeals of North Carolina.
June 2, 1981.
Atty. Gen. Rufus L. Edmisten by Associate Atty. Gen. Lucien Capone, III, Raleigh, for the State.
Asst. Public Defender, Twelfth Judicial District, John G. Britt, Jr., Fayetteville, for defendant-appellant.
HARRY C. MARTIN, Judge.
Defendant was convicted of violating N.C.G.S. 14-202.1, and now attacks the constitutionality of this statute. He contends the statute is unconstitutional in that (a) it *575 is a denial of due process because of vagueness, (b) it is a denial of equal protection because of age classification in the statute, and (c) it is an overbroad restriction on protected activity. Defendant does not cite any authority in support of his contentions.
It is clear that the challenged statute is constitutional. Our Supreme Court has passed upon these identical arguments in State v. Elam, 302 N.C. 157, 273 S.E.2d 661 (filed 27 January 1981). Further elaboration on these points in this opinion would serve no useful purpose. The law as stated in Elam controls this appeal, and the assignments of error directed to the constitutionality of the statute are overruled.
Defendant contends the court erred in its charge by instructing the jury that masturbation in the presence of another would be an immoral or indecent act within the meaning of the statute. Defendant argues that because the statute uses the words "with any child," there must be some touching of the child to constitute an indecent liberty under the statute. We reject the argument and hold that it is not necessary that there be a touching of the child by the defendant in order to constitute an indecent liberty within the meaning of N.C. G.S. 14-202.1. See State v. Turgeon, 44 N.C.App. 547, 261 S.E.2d 501, disc. rev. denied, 299 N.C. 740, 267 S.E.2d 669 (1980). The purpose of the statute is to give broader protection to children than the prior laws provided. State v. Harward, 264 N.C. 746, 142 S.E.2d 691 (1965). The word "with" is not limited to mean only a physical touching. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2626 (1971). We find no prejudicial error in the challenged instruction.
Accordingly, we hold that the acts allegedly performed by defendant were "immoral, improper, or indecent liberties" within the meaning of the statute. Therefore, we overrule defendant's last assignment of error, in which he contends the trial court erred in denying his motions to dismiss for insufficiency of the state's evidence.
No error.

Jerry J. RILEY
v.
JEFFERSON DAVIS COUNTY, Mississippi.
No. 92-CA-00848-SCT.
Supreme Court of Mississippi.
February 5, 1996.
*749 Donald C. Woods, Clinton, for appellant.
Donald G. Kruger, Prentiss, for appellee.
Before PRATHER, P.J., and PITTMAN and McRAE, JJ.
PITTMAN, Justice, for the Court:
This is an appeal from an order entered by the Circuit Court of Jefferson Davis County, Mississippi, on July 27, 1992. The circuit court upheld the Board of Supervisors of Jefferson Davis County, hereinafter "Board," ruling on the Appellant's Petition for Reduction and/or Change of Assessment as permitted by Miss. Code Ann. § 11-51-75 (1972).[1]
Jerry J. Riley filed a Petition for Reduction and/or Change of Assessment with the Board. On June 3, 1991, the Board met and considered Riley's Petition and notified him of their decision by Order dated June 3, 1991, and certified on June 24, 1991. Subsequently, Riley filed a Motion for Reconsideration with the Board. The Board by Order dated August 5, 1991, and certified August 23, 1991, affirmed the Order of June 3, 1991. Riley appealed the Board's decision to the Circuit Court pursuant to Mississippi Code Annotated Section 11-51-75 (1972).
On September 3, 1991, Riley filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment and Injunctive Relief against Jefferson Davis County, Mississippi. He then filed a Motion to Amend the Complaint on February 3, 1992. Jefferson Davis County filed the appropriate response and Riley timely replied to the response. Thereafter, the Circuit Court entered its Order Overruling Petition for Reduction and/or Change of Assessment on July 27, 1992. Aggrieved by the lower court's Order, Riley filed Notice of Appeal to this Court. The issue on appeal is:
WHETHER PURSUANT TO MISSISSIPPI CODE ANNOTATED SECTION 27-35-50(4), THE OWNER OF TWO UNDEVELOPED LOTS IS ENTITLED TO AN AGRICULTURAL CLASSIFICATION FOR AD VALOREM TAX PURPOSES WHEN THE LAND IS UNDISPUTABLY DEVOTED TO PRODUCTION OF TIMBER.
The circuit court's Order Overruling Petition for Reduction and/or Change of Assessment was in error and the case should be reversed and remanded for action consistent with this opinion.
In his complaint Riley alleged that he was the owner of certain real property located in Prentiss, Jefferson Davis County, Mississippi. More specifically, he owned two lots described as follows: Lots 2 & 3, Blk 1, Quinn Gardens S/D PB 1/27, Sec. 001-C7N-19W, Deed 86-229. Riley's property is assessed on the tax rolls of Jefferson Davis County as residential property. The said lots are used only for growing pine trees. At no time has Riley constructed a residence or any form of habitable structure on the land. Subsequent to a subdivision plat being recorded on July 20, 1962, they zoned the subdivision for residential use. However, Riley asserts that pursuant to Mississippi Code Annotated § 27-35-50(4) (1972) it is the use of the land and not the location which must be the determining factor in assessing the *750 land for tax purposes. The Board, on the other hand, claims that the location will control how the assessment will be ascertained. It is this dispute concerning the interpretation of Mississippi Code Annotated Section 27-35-50 (1972) and specifically subsection (4) that is today brought to this Court for a final determination.
Riley takes this appeal pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. § 11-51-75 (1972). This Court clearly stated the standard of review for such appeals in Thornton v. Wayne County Election Com., 272 So.2d 298 (Miss. 1973).
The circuit court reviews the record made before the board, of the testimony made or proffered, to determine whether or not the acts and orders of the board are reasonable and proper or arbitrary or capricious or beyond the power of the board to make or whether they violate any constitutional right of the complaining party.
Thornton, 272 So.2d at 301-02 (citations omitted).
The crux of this case is whether Riley's property may properly be assessed as agricultural for ad valorem tax purposes pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. § 27-35-50 (1972). The relevant part of the statute reads as follows:
(4) In arriving at the true value of all Class I and Class II property and improvements, the appraisal shall be made according to current use, regardless of location.


In arriving at the true value of any land used for agricultural purposes, the appraisal shall be made according to its current use, regardless of location. ... The land shall be deemed to be used for agricultural purposes when it is devoted to the commercial production of crops and other commercial products of the soil, including but not limited to the production of fruits and timber or the raising of live-stock and poultry.
Miss. Code Ann. § 27-35-50(4) (Supp. 1990) (emphasis added).
Section 27-35-50 is in accord with the Mississippi Constitution. Article 4, Section 112 states that "[t]he Legislature shall provide, by general laws, the method by which the true value of taxable property shall be ascertained; provided, however, in arriving at the true value of Class I and Class II property,[2] the appraisal shall be made according to current use, regardless of location." Miss. Const. of 1890, art. IV, § 112 (1994) (emphasis added).
Riley contends that under the above-mentioned statute and the Mississippi Constitution his land should be assessed as agricultural property. He notes that the Board and the tax assessor required Riley to rezone in order to obtain reclassification. Instead of applying the proper code section, the Board and tax assessor created a new test and procedure for procuring an agricultural classification. Riley argues that contra to the controlling code section, the Board and Tax Assessor determined that rezoning would be the test for obtaining an agricultural classification for ad valorem tax purposes. This test for assessment is both arbitrary and capricious.
The Board contends that Riley did not meet all the requirements of Miss. Code Ann. § 27-35-50(4) and thus, it was within the discretion of the tax assessor as to how he would classify the land. In formulating this argument, the Board relies upon the language "devoted to commercial production" in the statute. Miss. Code Ann. § 27-35-50(4) (Supp. 1990). It is the Board's contention that Riley had no commercial motivation at all, but rather was attempting to escape the increase in residential taxes. Therefore, it is the Board's position that Riley did not meet the requirements of § 27-35-50(4) and ergo, the tax assessor had discretion to classify the property as he saw fit.
In affirming the Board's decision, the circuit court also created a new reclassification test. Riley asserts that the court erred when *751 it focused on the use, assessment and zoning of other lots located in the platted subdivision. Riley claims that the effect of the circuit court's ruling was to render the current use of Riley's land immaterial to the classification of said land for tax purposes. This is in direct conflict with the statute and the Mississippi Constitution. The lower court stated that Riley would be entitled to tax relief only when he demonstrated two things: (1) that other lots in Quinn Gardens are subject to be reclassified as agricultural, or (2) the other lots are "assessed differently."
The Board erroneously created a discretion that does not exist. The Board acted beyond its powers when it granted such discretion to the tax assessor. It is not clear whether the land is for "commercial production." Furthermore, the statutory language "according to current use, regardless of location" refers to both Class I and Class II property. Whether the land is residential or agricultural, both values are determined according to the land's current use. Neither the Board nor the circuit court should depend upon the zoning or the other lots around the land for determining the classification. The statute reads very clearly and should not be misconstrued. The land shall be appraised according to its current use.
The land has never been used for residential purposes. It was used for agricultural purposes when the city zoned it as residential. Mere zoning laws will not change the use of the property. The clear language of the statute states that land will be assessed "according to current use, regardless of location" and it is apparent that Riley's land is used for agricultural purposes regardless of its location.
Furthermore, it is Riley's contention that the actions by the Board and the court below have created an irrebuttable presumption that the use of his property could only be residential. It is this irrebuttable presumption that Riley contends violates the due process clause of both the Mississippi Constitution and the Federal Constitution. In support of this argument Riley cites a Florida Supreme Court case, Bass v. General Development Corp., 374 So.2d 479 (Fla. 1979).
In Bass, the appellant challenged the lower court's ruling that a state tax statute requiring certain lands to be reclassified as nonagricultural if the owner had recorded a subdivision plat subsequent to the enactment of the law was unconstitutional. Bass, 374 So.2d at 479-80. The appellee in Bass filed a subdivision plat for a portion of its land subsequent to the enactment of the aforementioned statute. Id. at 480. Thus, the appellant tax assessor denied an agricultural tax classification for the property at issue. For four years the tax assessor denied the land an agricultural tax classification. Id. During this time additional subdivision plats were recorded for portions of the appellee's land. However, the land was under a cattle grazing lease and was exclusively devoted to agricultural activity. Id. at 479. The appellee filed four suits challenging the denials of an agricultural tax classification and attacking the constitutionality of the statute. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the appellee holding that the Florida statute was unconstitutional "because it violates due process by creating an irrebuttable presumption that land for which the owner has recorded a subdivision plat is nonagricultural." Id. at 480. The Florida Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's holding that the statute was unconstitutional. Id. at 486.
Riley recognizes that his denial of agricultural status is not predicated on a statute. However, he draws a persuasive analogy between the irrebuttable presumption that the land is nonagricultural because of the recording of a subdivision plat created by the Board, the tax assessor, and the circuit court and the irrebuttable presumption in Bass. The decisions of the tax assessor, the Board, and the circuit court all placed reliance upon the fact that a subdivision plat had been recorded for the land in question and that the other plots were all residential. This effectively created the same irrebuttable presumption that the statute created in Bass. The Florida Supreme Court noted that:
it is unreasonable and unconstitutionally impermissible to presume conclusively from the recording of a subdivision plat *752 that the platted land is not presently being used primarily for good faith commercial agricultural purposes; and ... that although the recording of a subdivision plat may support a conclusive presumption that the intended future use of the platted land will be nonagricultural, to single out this class of taxpayers from all other[s] who are assessed on a present use criteria is so disparate as to deny them equal protection of the law.
Bass, 374 So.2d at 485-86. We hold that the Florida Supreme Court's analysis and holding are persuasive in the case sub judice.
Although the present case and the case in Bass are not exactly on point factually, the number of similarities lends to its persuasiveness. The Florida State Constitution Article VII, Section 4(a) requires that "assessment of agricultural land be based upon its character or use." Bass, 374 So.2d at 481. The Mississippi State Constitution states that "the appraisal shall be made according to current use, regardless of location." Miss. Const. of 1890, art. IV, § 112 (1994) (emphasis added). In both cases the fact that a subdivision plat had been recorded created an irrebuttable presumption that the land was used for nonagricultural purposes. The Florida Supreme Court noted that "[t]he filing of a subdivision plat has little to do with the present use of property." Bass, 374 So.2d at 484. The irrebuttable presumption created by the decisions of the tribunals below denies Riley of equal protection of the law just as the irrebuttable presumption did in Bass. Thus, the Board's action violated Riley's constitutional rights.
The Mississippi Constitution and the relevant statute require that land be assessed according to current use for purposes of ad valorem taxes. Yet, the Board determined that reliance upon location and use of surrounding parcels of land was the test for assessment by the tax assessor. The Board created unfettered discretion and acted beyond its powers in doing so. Therefore, the Board's actions were in direct conflict with controlling law and are improper, arbitrary, capricious, beyond their powers, and a violation of Riley's constitutional rights. Thus, this case is reversed and remanded for action consistent with this opinion.
REVERSED AND REMANDED.

Before WALLACE, KENNEDY and CANBY, Circuit Judges:
PER CURIAM.


1
This appeal arises from the attempts of several taxpayers to establish "Clifford Trusts" for the benefit of their children.  See 26 U.S.C. Secs. 671-78 (1976).  In each case the corpus of the trust consisted of $10 cash and a promissory note executed by taxpayers in amounts ranging from $10,000 to $85,000.  Taxpayers made payments to the trusts of "interest" on the notes and sought interest deductions therefor.


2
The Tax Court, in a well-reasoned memorandum, held that under applicable Nevada law the promissory notes were unenforceable for lack of consideration.    Strimling v. Commissioner, T.C.Memo. 1983-281, 46 T.C.M.  (CCH) 211 (1983).  It accordingly held that taxpayers' payments of "interest" on the notes constituted nondeductible gifts rather than deductible interest payments.  Id.  We conclude that the Tax Court was correct in both rulings, and we adopt the reasoning of its memorandum.


3
Like the Tax Court, we do not reach the question whether these trusts represented sham transactions.  It is enough that the payments on the unenforceable notes fail to qualify as "interest," which has been defined as the "amount one has contracted to pay for the use of borrowed money."    Old Colony R. Co. v. Commissioner, 284 U.S. 552, 560, 52 S.Ct. 211, 213, 76 L.Ed. 484 (1932).

Before REAVLEY, ELROD, and SOUTHWICK, Circuit Judges.
REAVLEY, Circuit Judge:
      This case involves a lender who sued a guarantor for the breach of three
personal guarantees. George Kaleh signed the guarantee agreements in
conjunction with a real-estate-development project, and Western-Southern
Life Assurance Company financed the project. After the borrowers defaulted
on the underlying loans, Western foreclosed on the property and sued Kaleh.
      The district court conducted a bench trial, found each claim timely, and
awarded Western some but not all of its various forms of damages. Both Kaleh
and Western appealed. After sorting through numerous issues, we vacate and
remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

                                  I.    BACKGROUND
      George Kaleh and Paul Buchanan (Texas residents) solicited
Western-Southern Life Assurance Company (an Ohio resident) to finance the
development of “the Meritage,” a luxury apartment complex to be built in
Houston, Texas. Kaleh and Buchanan formed three similarly-named entities
for the purpose of borrowing funds: Sedona Apartments, LP; Sedona Apts GP,
LLC; and Sedona Investors, L.P. The borrowing entities then secured two loans
from Western. The parties segmented the loans in this manner to differentiate
the interest rates—a lower interest rate for the less risky loan and a higher
rate for the more risky loan.
      First, Sedona Apartments, LP, which held title to the Meritage property,
signed the Construction Loan Agreement and a corresponding promissory note
(referred to collectively as the “Construction Loan”) in exchange for
$22,738,000. The parties secured the Construction Loan by a deed of trust for
the Meritage property. Second, Sedona Apts GP, LLC and Sedona Investors,
L.P. signed the Mezzanine Loan Agreement and a corresponding promissory
note (referred to collectively as the “Mezzanine Loan”) in exchange for
$6,139,200. The collateral for the Mezzanine Loan is disputed, see infra § B.3,
but the loan documents clarify the collateral was a pledge of 100% of the
membership interest in Sedona Apts GP, LLC and 100% of the partnership
interest in Sedona Investors, L.P, which together accounted for 100% of the
equitable interest in Sedona Apartments, LP. The loan agreements each
contained a Texas choice-of-law clause. 1
      Next, Kaleh signed three personal guarantees. First, Kaleh guaranteed
the debt under the Construction Loan (the “Construction Guarantee”). Second,



      1   The parties later amended both loan agreements in ways immaterial to this dispute.

                                     No. 16-20546

Kaleh guaranteed the debt under the Mezzanine Loan (the “Mezzanine
Guarantee”). Both guarantees further obligated Kaleh’s payment of (1)
property insurance; (2) real estate taxes; (3) unremitted security deposits; and
(4) attorney’s fees incurred by Western. Finally, Kaleh guaranteed completion
of the project (the “Completion Guarantee”), or more specifically, (1) completed
construction of the Meritage; (2) payment of labor and service fees; (3) payment
of budget overruns; (4) presentation of the Meritage without liens; and (5)
payment of attorney’s fees incurred by Western. Each guarantee contained an
Ohio choice-of-law clause.
      On April 16 and 17, 2009, Western sent the borrowers and Kaleh notices
of default on the two loans, stating an intent to deem the notes due and payable
if default went uncured. On August 11, 2009, Western delivered notice of
acceleration of the debts. The following month, Western foreclosed on the
membership interests secured by the Mezzanine Loan, purchased the
interests, and took control of the property. Later, in December 2009, Western
foreclosed on the Meritage itself and purchased the property for $18,000,000.
Western then sought to complete construction of the Meritage and incurred
various costs in doing so.
      In June 2010, Western demanded payment from Kaleh. Three years
later, on June 26, 2013, Western sued Kaleh for breach of the guarantees,
claiming damages for the unpaid balance of the loans, post-foreclosure
construction costs, settlement of construction liens, unpaid insurance
premiums, unpaid property taxes, unremitted security deposits, and attorney’s
fees. 2 Western paid those attorney’s fees to Baker Botts (for assisting in the

Guarantee claim.

foreclosure and lien settlements), Frost Brown & Todd (for assisting in the
foreclosure and related Ohio litigation), and Vorys, Sater, Seymour, and Pease
(for conducting the present litigation and appeal). The district court held a
bench trial and issued findings of fact and conclusions of law.
      The court held all three of Western’s breach-of-guarantee claims were
timely. The court then found liability on each claim and awarded Western
$2,537,561.78 for the unpaid debt under the two loans (crediting the value of
the property), and $1,306,177.44 for unpaid liens, property taxes, security
deposits, and insurance premiums. But the court denied Western a vast
majority of its $925,956 in attorney’s fees 3 and all of its $619,981 in
post-foreclosure construction costs.
      Kaleh appealed, challenging the timeliness of Western’s various claims.
And Western cross-appealed, challenging the denial of its attorney’s fees and

      In the wake of a bench trial, “findings of fact are reviewed for clear error
and legal issues are reviewed de novo.” In re Mid-S. Towing Co., 418 F.3d 526,
531 (5th Cir. 2005). “A finding is clearly erroneous if it is without substantial
evidence to support it, the court misinterpreted the effect of the evidence, or
this court is convinced that the findings are against the preponderance of
credible testimony.” Becker v. Tidewater, Inc., 586 F.3d 358, 365 (5th Cir.
2009).
      This diversity case involves a couple of Erie guesses. “When making an
Erie guess, [o]ur task is to attempt to predict state law, not to create or modify
it.” SMI Owen Steel Co. v. Marsh USA, Inc., 520 F.3d 432, 442 (5th Cir. 2008)


      3 The court did, however, award Western $41,700 in appellate attorney’s fees, a sum
Kaleh does not challenge on appeal and that we leave undisturbed.

(alteration in original). We look first to cases from the relevant state’s Supreme
Court that, “while not deciding the issue, provide guidance as to how the
[Court] would decide the question before us.” Am. Int’l Specialty Lines Ins. Co.
v. Rentech Steel, L.L.C., 620 F.3d 558, 564 (5th Cir. 2010). And “we also
consider those decisions of [the state’s] appellate courts in determining how
the [state] Supreme Court would rule on th[e] issue.” Id. at 566.
                             III.    DISCUSSION
A.    The Governing Law
      We must first stake out the governing law. Kaleh points to the
underlying loan documents as mandating Texas law across the board, whereas
Western offers the guarantees’ Ohio choice-of-law clauses as the operative
provisions. The district court forged its own path, applying Ohio substantive
law and Texas procedural law. We agree with the district court.
      In this diversity action, we look to Texas (the forum state) for the
choice-of-law principles necessary “to determine which substantive law will
apply.” Weber v. PACT XPP Techs., AG, 811 F.3d 758, 770 (5th Cir. 2016).
Texas will enforce a choice-of-law clause unless (1) “the chosen state has no
substantial relationship to the parties or the transaction and there is no other
reasonable basis for the parties’ choice” or (2) the chosen law would be
“contrary to a fundamental policy of a state which has a materially greater
interest than the chosen state in the determination of the particular issue and
which . . . would be the state of applicable law in the absence of an effective
choice of law by the parties.” Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Drennen, 452 S.W.3d 319,
324–25 (Tex. 2014) (quoting RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONFLICT OF LAWS
§ 187(2) (1971)). Neither side argues the choice-of-law clauses before us are
unenforceable under the preceding rubric. Nor do the parties argue the clauses

are nullified by an irreconcilable conflict. Instead, we are left to pick between
the two.
       The Supreme Court of Texas has yet to face the specific question posed
in this case, but we are nevertheless confident Texas law dictates that the
guarantees’ choice of law governs the substantive components of this lawsuit. 4
We start with a basic Texas principle: “A guaranty is a separate contract
distinct from the primary obligation.” Ashcraft v. Lookadoo, 952 S.W.2d 907,
913 (Tex. App. 1997). Kaleh offers no authority for deviating from that
principle and disregarding the law of the guarantees (contracts he signed
personally and which govern Western’s lawsuit directly) in favor of the law of
the loan documents (contracts he did not sign personally and which supply only
the underlying liability). And, in fact, the intermediate Texas case to address
this question head-on holds contrary to Kaleh’s proposition. See Georgetown


       4 Although this court has not answered the precise question either, the topic is not
unfamiliar. First, in Resolution Trust Corp. v. Northpark Joint Venture, 958 F.2d 1313, 1318–
19 (5th Cir. 1992), this court applied the chosen law of the promissory note over the chosen
law of the deed of trust. Some years later, in a more factually analogous breach-of-guarantee
case, this court confronted divergent choice-of-law provisions in the deed of trust and
guarantee agreements. Int’l Interest, L.P. v. Hardy, 448 F.3d 303, 307–308 (5th Cir. 2006).
Instead of resolving that conflict, the Hardy panel certified the question to the Supreme Court
of Texas. Id. But, before the Court could answer, the parties settled and we dismissed the
appeal. Oddly enough, neither party mentions Hardy, let alone requests certification.
        Though we are mindful of the Hardy panel’s decision to certify the question, we do not
feel the need to do so here. Hardy’s trepidation arose from the advent of TEX. PROP. CODE
§ 51.003, a 1993 anti-deficiency statute discussed in some detail below. See infra § B.1–3.
Specifically, the Hardy panel was concerned that enforcing a generic choice-of-law clause to
effectively waive section 51.003’s substantive protections might be unenforceable as
inconsistent with Texas policy. 448 F.3d at 308. Yet, neither party here argues the choice-of-
law clauses are unenforceable in light of section 51.003. And, more importantly, the Supreme
Court of Texas has since addressed waiver of section 51.003’s substantive components,
concluding that a party may waive its anti-deficiency protections with nothing more than a
generic disclaimer of “any defense.” Moayedi v. Interstate 35/Chisam Rd., 438 S.W.3d 1, 3,
6–8 (Tex. 2014). In other words, section 51.003 no longer casts the same shadow over the
viability of a choice-of-law clause, and the impetus for Hardy’s certification has since been
alleviated.

Assocs., Ltd. v. Home Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n, 795 S.W.2d 252, 253–54 (Tex.
App. 1990). There, the court applied the chosen law of the guarantee over a
conflicting clause in the promissory note. See id. at 253 (“[T]he Guaranty on its
face selects Texas law, and that choice should be respected. A plaintiff is
entitled to sue on whatever obligation it chooses—here, the Guaranty.”). Kaleh
is thus bound by his guarantees, and Ohio substantive law governs.
      Entirely separate, however, is the question of what procedural law to
apply. Texas’s rule is simple: “Even if a contract contains a choice-of-law
provision in which the parties have agreed to apply the law of a different state,
[Texas] as the forum will apply [its] own law to matters of remedy and
procedure.” Man Indus. (India), Ltd. v. Midcontinent Express Pipeline, LLC,
407 S.W.3d 342, 352 (Tex. App. 2013) (quoting Autonation Direct.com, Inc. v.
Thomas A Moorehead, Inc., 278 S.W.3d 470, 472 (Tex. App. 2009)). The district
court was right to apply Texas procedural law.
B.    The Timeliness of Western’s Claims
      We are tasked first with analyzing the timeliness of Western’s claims.
Texas procedural law in hand, we look for a Texas statute of limitations. The
parties offer two candidates. The first is TEX. PROP. CODE § 51.003(a), which
imposes a two-year limitations period:
      If the price at which real property is sold at a foreclosure sale
      under Section 51.002 is less than the unpaid balance of the
      indebtedness secured by the real property, resulting in a
      deficiency, any action brought to recover the deficiency must be
      brought within two years of the foreclosure sale and is governed by
      this section.
TEX. PROP. CODE § 51.003(a). And the second is TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE
§ 16.004(a)(3), which contains a generic four-year limitations period: “A person
must bring suit on [a debt] not later than four years after the day the cause of
action accrues.” TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE. § 16.004(a)(3).
                                         7
    Case: 16-20546     Document: 00514306629     Page: 8   Date Filed: 01/12/2018


                                  No. 16-20546

      1. Is section 51.003(a)’s two-year limitations period procedural or
         substantive?
      The district court recognized that Texas usually treats statutes of
limitations as procedural devices. Baker Hughes, Inc. v. Keco R. & D., Inc., 12
S.W.3d 1, 4 (Tex. 1999). But, with respect to section 51.003(a), the court applied
a narrow caveat: when a statute creates both the right of action and the statute
of limitations, Texas treats the limitations period as substantive. Concluding
that “the two-year limitations period to sue on the deficiency is expressly
contained within the subsection of the statute creating the right to sue to
recover the deficiency,” the court deemed section 51.003(a) substantive and
thus inapplicable to Western’s claims.
      The court’s recitation of Texas law was correct; Texas has long
recognized that certain limitations periods are outside of the default
procedural category. The exception emanates most prominently from
California v. Copus, 309 S.W.2d 227, 231 (Tex. 1958). There, the Supreme
Court of Texas explained, “where the statute creates a right and also
incorporates a limitation upon the time within which the suit is to be brought,
the limitation qualifies the right so that it becomes a part of the substantive
law rather than procedural.” Id. It continued, “[w]here by statute a right of
action is given which did not exist by the common law, and the statute giving
the right fixes the time within which the right may be enforced, the time so
fixed becomes a limitation or condition on such right, and will control, no
matter in what forum the action is brought.” Id. (quoting 15 C.J.S. Limitation
of Actions § 30).
      We disagree, however, that the Copus exception applies to section
51.003(a). Contrary to the district court’s characterization, section 51.003 does
not create the right to sue to recover a deficiency—it creates no cause of action

                                         8
    Case: 16-20546     Document: 00514306629      Page: 9   Date Filed: 01/12/2018


                                  No. 16-20546

at all. Texas courts have acknowledged as much, explaining that section 51.003
“does not create the right to bring an action for a deficiency; it merely regulates
a right that apparently existed at common law,” or in other words, section
51.003 “merely places a procedural limitation on a traditional common-law
right of action.” Trunkhill Capital, Inc. v. Jansma, 905 S.W.2d 464, 468 (Tex.
App. 1995); see also Colvest Mortg., Inc. v. Clark, No. 05-95-00989-CV, 1996
WL 429300, at *3 (Tex. App. July 23, 1996) (observing the same).
      Western does little to rebut this truth and chooses to defend the district
court’s decision on a different theory: Section 51.003 creates a host of other
substantive rights, and we should not excise the two-year limitations period
from such a “substantive unified statutory scheme.” Sure enough, section
51.003 creates several substantive rights. See Moayedi v. Interstate 35/Chisam
Rd., L.P., 438 S.W.3d 1, 6 (Tex. 2014). Among them, subsection (b) provides the
defendant a right to request a fair-market-value determination, subsection (c)
provides the defendant a right to offset against the deficiency, and subsection
(d) credits insurance proceeds to the account of the borrower in certain
situations. TEX. PROP. CODE. §§ 51.003(b)–(d).
      But Western’s reliance on the statute’s creation of any substantive right
fundamentally misunderstands Copus. The Supreme Court of Texas spoke not
of any old right but of the right (the only right) a statute of limitations
“qualifies”—the “right of action.” Copus, 309 S.W.2d at 231. Section 51.003(a)’s
limitations period qualifies the plaintiff’s right to seek a deficiency judgment,
a cause of action we have already established exists independent of the
statutory scheme. But the limitations period in no way qualifies the
defendant’s right to assert offset or valuation defenses; the substantive and
procedural matters exist independently, albeit under the same statutory roof.

                                 No. 16-20546

      Western’s authority only serves to crystalize section 51.003(a)’s
procedural nature. See Chase Manhattan Bank v. Greenbriar N. Section II, 835
S.W.2d 720, 727 (Tex. App. 1992); Bank of Okla., N.A. v. Red Arrow Marina
Sales & Serv., Inc., 224 P.3d 685, 696 (Okla. 2009). Both of these cases dealt
with anti-deficiency statutes distinct from section 51.003. Chase, 835 S.W.2d
at 727; Red Arrow, 224 P.3d at 689. And while both cases involved pre-suit
time periods, the periods were not statutes of limitations at all but were
instead “condition[s] precedent”—substantive elements of the respective
deficiency claims. Chase, 835 S.W.2d at 724–25; Red Arrow, 224 P.3d at 696.
To make matters even more clear, Red Arrow explained that the condition
before it “differ[ed] vastly” from “an ordinary statute of limitations” because
the latter “regulates merely the time for the commencement of an action.” 224
P.3d at 696 n.38. Section 51.003(a) does exactly that by regulating the time in
which an action “must be brought.” TEX. PROP. CODE. § 51.003(a). It is therefore
a quintessential statute of limitations within the ambit of default procedural
characterization.
      2. Did Kaleh waive his section 51.003(a) statute-of-limitations defense?
      Having lost the substantive-versus-procedural battle, Western seeks to
limit section 51.003(a)’s effective reach. Western claims first that Kaleh
outright waived section 51.003(a) via the following language from each of the
three guarantees:
      No setoff, counterclaim, reduction or diminution of any obligation,
      or any defense of any kind or nature, that Guarantor has or may
      have in the future against Borrower, or that Borrower has or may
      have in the future against Lender, will be available hereunder to
      Guarantor against Lender.
The district court rejected this argument, reading the above provision to waive
only defenses the borrower may have against the lender, not those “that might

                                      10
    Case: 16-20546       Document: 00514306629          Page: 11     Date Filed: 01/12/2018


                                       No. 16-20546

be independently available to the guarantor against the lender.” That reading
was unduly narrow given our decision in LaSalle Bank National Association v.
Sleutel, 289 F.3d 837, 840–42 (5th Cir. 2002), in which we applied a similar
provision to waive a guarantor’s right to assert a defense directly against a
lender. But the district court’s ultimate conclusion stands. Assuming for the
sake of argument that the scope of Kaleh’s waiver was broad enough to capture
limitations, it was void under Texas law. Duncan v. Lisenby, 912 S.W.2d 857,
858–59 (Tex. App. 1995) (explaining that “[a] general agreement in advance to
waive” limitations is void and that the waiver “must be specific and for a pre-
determined length of time” to be enforceable); see also Titus v. Wells Fargo
Bank & Union Trust Co., 134 F.2d 223, 224 (5th Cir. 1943). Kaleh did not waive
his two-year limitations defense.
       3. What is the breadth of section 51.003(a)’s application?
       At this juncture, where section 51.003(a) is both procedural and not
waived, Western acknowledges that its claim to recover the unpaid balance of
the Construction Loan is governed by the two-year limitations period. 5 And
there is no question Western filed its suit more than two years after its
December 2009 foreclosure on the Meritage property. Western’s claim to
recover unpaid debt under the Construction Loan was therefore time-barred,
and the district court erred in holding otherwise. See TEX. PROP. CODE
§ 51.003(a) (requiring suit “be brought within two years of the foreclosure
sale”).




       5 To the extent TEX. PROP. CODE § 51.003(a) and TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE
§ 16.004(a)(3) both apply to the same claim, “the more specific time limit controls.” Valdez v.
Hollenbeck, 465 S.W.3d 217, 227 (Tex. 2015); see also Sowell v. Int’l Interests, LP, 416 S.W.3d
593, 599 (Tex. App. 2013) (applying section 51.003(a) over section 16.004(a)(3) when the two
conflicted).

                                      No. 16-20546

       But Western suggests the effect of section 51.003(a) goes no further. This
is so, Western says, because the two-year limitations period applies only to
suits to recover “indebtedness secured by the real property.” Id. And unlike the
Construction Guarantee claim, Western continues, the Mezzanine and
Completion Guarantee claims did not involve debt secured by real property. 6
       We agree with Western on this point. First, the Completion Guarantee
involved neither debt nor collateral; it simply created a set of ongoing personal
obligations related to the project’s completion. Without a debt collateralized by
real property, section 51.003(a) could not apply to Western’s Completion
Guarantee claim. See Drieling v. Sec. State Bank & Trust, No. 01-14-00257-
CV, 2015 WL 1020212, at *3 (Tex. App. Mar. 5, 2015) (explaining that section
51.003(a) does not apply when the note is not collateralized by real property).
       The Mezzanine Guarantee did, however, involve an underlying debt: the
Mezzanine Loan. The precise identity of the Mezzanine Loan’s collateral is
hotly contested on appeal. Western argues the loan was secured not by real
property but by a pledge of the ownership interest in the borrower entities.
Kaleh counters that the loan was secured by the Meritage property itself and
Western is “barred from arguing otherwise on appeal.” Kaleh advances his
quasi-estoppel argument by pointing to various instances in the record where
Western referred to the Mezzanine Loan as “secured by a Deed of Trust” or
“secured by the same collateral” as the Construction Loan. Western responds


       6 Western argues also that because section 51.003(a) applies only to claims for a
“deficiency judgment”—that is, claims for the unpaid balance of the indebtedness—it is
inapplicable to the remainder of Western’s non-deficiency damages (for unpaid property
taxes, security deposits, etc.) under the Construction Guarantee. Kaleh counters that all of
these measures of damages were identified by the Construction Loan’s deed of trust and thus
covered by section 51.003(a). But, because the Mezzanine Guarantee independently
guaranteed each of these measures of damage, and because we conclude section 51.003(a)
does not apply to the Mezzanine Guarantee, we need not reach Western’s argument or
Kaleh’s rebuttal.
                                            12

                                  No. 16-20546

in kind with its own citations to the record, where it clarified that the
Mezzanine Loan was “secured separately . . . by the . . . member’s interest in
that borrowing entity” or “by a pledge of ownership interest in the borrowers.”
      At most, this quarrel indicates the parties referred to the Mezzanine
Loan’s collateral in an inconsistent, sometimes self-contradictory manner. In
other words, the muddled record created a dispute about the collateral’s true
identity. But this is a dispute the parties already litigated and the district court
already resolved when it concluded the Mezzanine Loan was secured not by
real property but “by a pledge of the ownership interests the respective
borrowers had in the Meritage.” In so deciding, the court cited (and only cited)
the language of the Mezzanine Loan documents themselves, which
unambiguously identify the pledge of various membership interests as the
relevant collateral.
      Under Ohio law, the district court was on sure footing to rely on the
language of the loan documents in lieu of the parties’ extraneous
characterizations. See Aultman Hosp. Ass’n v. Comty. Mut. Ins. Co., 544 N.E.2d
920, 924 (Ohio 1989) (“[C]ourts will not give the contract a construction other
than that which the plain language of the contract provides.”). In turn, we do
not find clear error, and we will not disturb the court’s finding on appeal.
      4. Were Western’s Mezzanine and Completion Guarantee claims timely?
      Because neither the Mezzanine Guarantee claim nor the Completion
Guarantee claim sought to recover debt secured by real property, we withhold
application of TEX. PROP. CODE § 51.003(a) and subject those claims to the
generic four-year limitations period found in TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE
§ 16.004(a)(3). In that respect, the district court found Western’s claims timely.
The court so held because it identified a timely accrual date of June 30, 2010,
the day Western demanded payment from Kaleh.

                                        13

                                  No. 16-20546

      On appeal, Kaleh offers no explanation for how the Completion
Guarantee claim—which involved completion-related costs ostensibly incurred
after Western took control of the Meritage property in September 2009—could
have accrued more than four years prior to Western’s June 2013 suit. Kaleh
has therefore waived any challenge to the claim’s timeliness under the four-
year limitations period, and we affirm the court’s timeliness finding in that
respect. See Am. States Ins. Co. v. Bailey, 133 F.3d 363, 372 (5th Cir. 1998)
(“Failure to provide any legal or factual analysis of an issue results in waiver.”).
      As for the Mezzanine Guarantee claim, however, Kaleh offers a specific,
earlier accrual date: April 22, 2009, the day the borrowers failed to cure
following a notice of default. If we were to accept this date, Western’s claim to
recover unpaid indebtedness under the Mezzanine Guarantee would be
untimely.
      We turn to the Texas accrual framework. In Texas, “[a] claim for breach
of contract accrues when the contract is breached.” Cosgrove v. Cade, 468
S.W.3d 32, 39 (Tex. 2015). More specific to the suit-on-a-debt context, “[i]f
demand is an integral part of a cause of action or a condition precedent to the
right to sue, the statute of limitations does not begin to run until demand is
made, unless demand is waived or unreasonably delayed.” Wiman v.
Tomaszewicz, 877 S.W.2d 1, 5 (Tex. App. 1994) (emphasis added).
       The question therefore becomes: did the Mezzanine Guarantee waive
the need for demand? An examination of the “WAIVERS” provision in the
guarantee itself answers the question in the affirmative: “[N]otice of
default . . . demand for payment, notice of demand . . . are hereby waived.”
Western’s citation to the word “demand” elsewhere in the guarantee does
nothing to negate Kaleh’s unequivocal waiver. As a result, the district court’s

      Even so, the district court acknowledged the possibility that Kaleh
waived demand, and it bootstrapped its conclusion with an alternative accrual
date: September 28, 2009, the day Western foreclosed on the Mezzanine Loan.
The court picked this date because it held “the respective default on the
underlying [Mezzanine] loan did not occur until the [September] foreclosure.”
But that premise is unsupported by the record; Western notified the borrowers
on April 17, 2009 that the Mezzanine Loan “is now in default.” It is only natural
that the borrowers’ default predated foreclosure because a lender has “no right
to foreclosure” until the borrower defaults. Roberts v. Burkett, 802 S.W.2d 42,
46 n.3 (Tex. App. 1990). As a consequence, September 28, 2009 was similarly
inapt as an accrual date.
      Having disagreed with both of the district court’s accrual dates, we
confront a final timely alternative supplied by Western: August 11, 2009, the
day Western delivered notice of acceleration of the debt. Western points us to
the Texas framework summarized by Boren v. United States National Bank
Association, 807 F.3d 99, 104 (5th Cir. 2015). There, we explained that when a
promissory note “contains an optional acceleration clause . . . the action
accrues when the holder actually exercises its option to accelerate.” Id. (quoting
Holy Cross Church of God in Christ v. Wolf, 44 S.W.3d 562, 566 (Tex. 2001)). A
lender must generally send two forms of notice to exercise this option: (1) “a
notice of intent to accelerate” and (2) “a notice of acceleration.” Id.
      Western lobbies for affirmance under Boren because, though it sent a
notice of default and intent to accelerate in April 2009, it did not effectuate the
second prong of the equation until it sent the August 2009 notice of
acceleration. While Western is correct that the Mezzanine Loan’s promissory
note contains an acceleration clause, Western neglects an important caveat to
the Boren framework: a note maker can waive either of the default steps for

                                        15

                                       No. 16-20546

acceleration. See Shumway v. Horizon Credit Corp., 801 S.W.2d 890, 893–94
(Tex. 1991) (“[A] waiver of ‘notice of intent to accelerate’ is effective to waive
that right,” and “[w]aiver of ‘demand’ or ‘presentment’, and of ‘notice’ or ‘notice
of acceleration’, in just so many words, is effective to waive presentment and
notice of acceleration.”). The parties’ discussion of this particular waiver issue
is minimal; Kaleh suggests offhand that the loan documents waived notice of
acceleration, and Western leaves the issue entirely unaddressed. The answer
to that question is naturally of great importance to picking between the April
and August accrual dates, and it thus bears on the ultimate question of
timeliness.
       We decline, however, to pick between the two dates at this juncture
because the district court never reached the waiver question. See Stephens v.
Witco Corp., 198 F.3d 539, 542–43 (5th Cir. 1999) (declining to affirm on an
alternate legal theory when “questions of fact remain . . . that must be resolved
before” the law could be applied). We therefore instruct the district court, on
remand, to pass first judgment on the waiver question and to then evaluate
the Mezzanine Guarantee claim’s timeliness in light thereof. 7
C. Attorney’s Fees
       Having resolved Kaleh’s appeal, we turn now to Western’s cross-appeal.
Western raises two issues: (1) whether the district court correctly denied the
lion’s share of Western’s attorney’s fees and (2) whether the district court
correctly denied Western’s post-foreclosure construction costs. We must



       7 We note further that because the district court found the Mezzanine Guarantee claim
timely in all respects, it had no need to discern whether the non-loan liabilities stemming
from the Mezzanine Guarantee (unpaid insurance, real estate taxes, and security deposits)
should be subject to the same accrual date as the claim to recover the loan balance. Depending
on the district court’s answer to the waiver question, it is free to evaluate the issue for the
first time on remand.

address each issue because both measures of damages are anchored on
Western’s Completion Guarantee claim, a claim we affirmed above as timely.
See supra, § B.4.
      Applying Ohio substantive law, “the trial court[’s] determination [on
attorney’s fees] should not be reversed absent a showing that the court abused
its discretion.” Bittner v. Tri-County Toyota, Inc., 569 N.E.2d 464, 467 (Ohio
1991). At the same time, the trial court’s “legal determination[s]” are subject
to de novo review. State ex rel. DiFranco v. City of S. Euclid, 7 N.E.3d 1146,
1148 (Ohio 2014). The attorney’s-fees issue here is two-pronged. Substantively,
did Western’s proof of fees suffice under Ohio law? And procedurally, should
the district court have denied Western’s request to prove up fees as “costs” at
a post-trial hearing?
      1. Did Western’s fee evidence suffice?
      We address first the sufficiency of Western’s fee evidence. The Erie
question largely boils down to this: Under Ohio law, must a fee claimant
produce evidence of hours actually billed, rate actually charged, and work
done, or may a claimant simply describe the task performed, offer the total bill
incurred, and provide testimony that a reasonable rate and reasonable amount
of hours would approximate the total? The district court found Ohio law
requires the former, and because Western’s evidence largely took the form of
the latter, the court denied fees (save appellate fees). The Supreme Court of
Ohio has yet to outline the threshold for proof of attorney’s fees in this
particular respect, so we are left to venture an Erie guess.
      We begin with Bittner, in which the Supreme Court of Ohio solidified the
state’s acceptance of the lodestar method. 569 N.E.2d at 466. That is to say,
Ohio determines “the amount of a reasonable fee” by examining “the number
of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable

                                       17
    Case: 16-20546      Document: 00514306629        Page: 18     Date Filed: 01/12/2018


                                     No. 16-20546

hourly rate,” subject to a host of modifying factors. Id. Although the Bittner
Court did not go on to say whether the claimant must offer proof of hours
worked and rate charged, 8 it did cite heavily from Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461
U.S. 424 (1939). See Bittner, 569 N.E.2d at 466–467 (citing Hensley, 461 U.S.
at 424). Hensley contains, among other things, a command familiar to federal-
law practitioners: “The party seeking an award of fees should submit evidence
supporting the hours worked and rates claimed. Where the documentation of
hours is inadequate, the district court may reduce the award accordingly.” 461
U.S. at 433 (emphasis added). Bittner does not cite this specific proposition
from Hensley, but its reliance on Hensley’s approach indicates to us that the
Supreme Court of Ohio would likely accept the evidentiary principles therein. 9
      Bittner aside, our evaluation of Ohio intermediate caselaw brings us to
the same conclusion. The parties rely principally on two divergent cases. First
is In re Estate of Wood, 379 N.E.2d 256, 260 (Ohio Ct. App. 1977), in which an
Ohio court upheld a fee award for an estate lawyer because the attorney
“introduced sufficient evidence of the services performed and of the reasonable
value of such services” and the court found no precedent “which would require
an attorney to set forth the time he has expended.” On the other side of the
spectrum is Unick v. Pro-Cision, Inc., No. 05CV1401, 2011 WL 1005429, at *1,
*5, *7 (Ohio Ct. App. Mar. 16, 2011), in which the fee claimant “failed to provide
evidence of the rates or hours worked by his attorneys,” and the court denied



      8 Bittner did, however, make specific note of the fact that the “attorneys submitted
well-documented time reports detailing the amount of time they spent preparing for trial”
along with “testimony regarding the number of hours worked and their hourly rates of
recompense.” 569 N.E.2d at 466.
      9 In fact, the Sixth Circuit has cited the proof-of-hours-and-rate requirement from
Hensley when evaluating attorney’s fees under Ohio law. Yellowbook, Inc. v. Brandeberry,
708 F.3d 837, 848 (6th Cir. 2013) (citing Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437).

    Case: 16-20546      Document: 00514306629         Page: 19    Date Filed: 01/12/2018


                                     No. 16-20546

fees because the claimant “b[ore] the burden of initially proving the number of
hours an attorney spent on his case [and] the hourly rate that the attorney
charges.” (citing Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434); see also Pracker v. Dolan, No.
94-G-1867, 1995 WL 301455, at *4 (Ohio Ct. App. Apr. 21, 1995) (reversing a
fee award when the claimant submitted only the total hours billed but not the
hours spent for any particular service).
      We conclude Unick more accurately represents Ohio’s contemporary
approach for two reasons. First, Wood predates the Supreme Court of Ohio’s
opinion in Bittner (and its corresponding reliance on Hensley). And second, in
the relatively short time span since Unick, five other Ohio appellate courts—
including the same one that authored Wood—have cited Unick for the very
proposition at issue: proof of reasonable fees requires proof of work done, hours
billed, and rate charged. 10
      In light of Unick, we do not find the district court’s thorough review to
be an abuse of discretion. With respect to fees paid to Baker Botts and Frost
Brown & Todd, Western submitted only testimony of the service performed,
the total invoice, and an estimate that a reasonable hypothetical rate and a
reasonable number of hypothetical hours would approximate that total.
Western’s evidence left the district court to “speculate or surmise how much
time was involved for related services,” and ultimately, whether the fees
actually incurred were reasonable. Unick, 2011 WL 1005429, at *4. Western’s
evidence with respect to fees owed to trial counsel, Vorys, Sater, Seymour, and



      10 See Se. Land Dev., Ltd. v. Primrose Mgmt. L.L.C., 952 N.E.2d 563, 573–74 (Ohio Ct.

Pease, was closer to sufficient, but it ultimately suffered from the same basic
flaw. Western offered testimony of services performed, total fees incurred,
rates of some of the lawyers who worked on the case (but not all of them), and
total hours billed. But Western did not connect any of those components,
meaning the court was again left to speculate what work was performed, at
what rate, and for how many hours. That, too, was insufficient. See Pracker,
1995 WL 301455, at *4 (reversing fee award when the claimant submitted only
total hours billed but did not provide hours spent for any particular service).
      To conclude this issue, Western points out that the reason the district
court awarded appellate fees was because those “fees have not yet been
incurred, [and] the only evidence that could prove the reasonableness is expert
testimony” in the form of a future estimate. As such, Western argues it is at
the very least entitled to trial fees not yet incurred at the time its expert gave
his estimates. However, assuming Ohio law permits proof of future fees by way
of estimated hours and rates, we still affirm the district court’s denial. This is
so because Western’s expert did not segregate his blanket “September 2015 to
October 2015” estimate—which spanned both pre-trial work and estimated
trial work—between those fees attributed to work already done (for which
Western’s proof did not satisfy the Unick rule) and work to be done in the
future. As a consequence, the district court’s denial of fees was not error.
      2. Is the court’s decision to require proof of fees at trial reversible error?
      Western argues further that we must reverse and remand even if its
initial proof of fees did not suffice. More specifically, Western contends Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 54 entitled it to prove up its fees post-trial, or in other
words, that it should have been allowed to “supplement” its initial proof of fees
with “additional evidence.” Rule 54 provides in relevant part: “A claim for
attorney’s fees and related nontaxable expenses must be made by motion

                                        20

                                  No. 16-20546

unless the substantive law requires those fees to be proved at trial as an
element of damages.” FED. R. CIV. P. 54(d)(2)(A). The district court concluded
Western’s attorneys’ fees sounded in “damages” under Ohio law and thus
required proof of such fees at trial. Western disagrees, suggesting the fees are
better characterized as “costs” under Ohio law.
      Rule   54’s   damages-versus-costs    distinction     arises   with   relative
infrequency in this circuit, but when it does, it typically involves a party who
first moves for attorney’s fees as costs after trial. E.g., Richardson v. Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A., 740 F.3d 1035, 1037 (5th Cir. 2014); Williams v. Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A., 560 F. App’x 233, 245 (5th Cir. 2014) (per curiam). In that
situation, when the district court erroneously classifies the fees as “damages”
and denies the post-trial motion, it effectively deprives the fee-claimant of his
or her only opportunity to prove attorney’s fees, and we find reversible error.
Richardson, 740 F.3d at 1040.
      This case differs. The attorney’s-fees issue surfaced early on, the district
court placed Western on notice of the need to come forward at trial with
evidence of attorney’s fees, Western presented such evidence, and the court
ruled on the sufficiency of that evidence. Western was neither deprived of the
opportunity to prove up fees (like the claimant in Richardson) nor was Western
required to makes its case to the incorrect fact-finder—in the bench-trial
context, the court will evaluate fees either way. See Circle Y Constr., Inc. v.
WRH Realty Servs., Inc., 427 F. App’x 772, 777 (11th Cir. 2011) (per curiam)
(finding no reversible error when a district court allowed a post-bench-trial
Rule 54 motion because “the district court provided ample opportunity for both
sides to present . . . their positions on the amount of fees that were due and to
make a determination on the basis of that evidence”). Western received an
opportunity to prove fees, and the proof it offered did not suffice. Thus, even if

   Case: 16-20546     Document: 00514306629      Page: 22   Date Filed: 01/12/2018


                                  No. 16-20546

the district court mischaracterized Western’s fees as “damages” under Ohio
law, we perceive no harm in the process the district court employed, and we
will not reverse and remand.
D. Post-Foreclosure Construction Costs
      Finally, we evaluate whether Western was entitled to its post-foreclosure
construction costs. The district court grounded its denial of those costs in three
alternate holdings. We agree with the first and need go no further: the court
held Western’s failure to prove that its costs adhered to the project’s “Plans
and Specifications” foreclosed recovery. We review the legal component of that
holding de novo. See Long Beach Ass’n, Inc. v. Jones, 697 N.E.2d 208, 209 (Ohio
1998) (characterizing contract construction as an issue of law).
      In pertinent part, Kaleh agreed under the Completion Guarantee to
indemnify Western for costs and expenses “incurred . . . because of . . . the
Project [not being] fully completed in accordance with the Plans and
Specifications and the other provisions of the Loan Agreement, including
without limitation the requirements of Section 4.13 of the Loan Agreement,
and in conformity with existing zoning and other laws, ordinances and
regulations.” Western contends the district court focused too narrowly on the
“Plans and Specifications” phrase, and instead, the court should have
permitted recovery under the “other provisions of the Loan Agreement” clause.
Such “other provisions” cover things like damage or destruction, vandalism,
and structural defects, to name a few. Western says its costs, regardless of
whether they were tied to the “Plans and Specifications,” fall into one of these
other categories.
      Yet, Western’s reading misunderstands the structure of the guarantee.
In the most basic sense, Kaleh agreed to ensure that the Meritage project was
“completed.” Phrased from the lender’s perspective, Western was entitled to

                                       22
    Case: 16-20546       Document: 00514306629          Page: 23     Date Filed: 01/12/2018


                                       No. 16-20546

recover costs incurred to make the project “complete.” But what does
“completion” mean? The above provision, awkwardly phrased as it may be,
provides the definition; it explains that completion requires the conjunctive
coalescence of several things: (1) satisfaction of the project’s “Plans and
Specifications” and (2) satisfaction of the “other provisions of the Loan
agreement” and (3) satisfaction of other criteria not relevant here. See Clagg
v. Baycliffs Corp., 695 N.E.2d 728, 731 (Ohio 1998) (explaining that “the word
‘and’ is usually interpreted in the conjunctive”). 11
       Viewed through that lens, Western’s misstep becomes apparent.
Western is indeed correct that costs incurred in remediating something
covered by the “other provisions of the Loan agreement” could be recoverable.
After all, a Meritage property with material damage, vandalism, or a
structural defect is not “completed” under the terms of the guarantee. But, for
Western to remediate the defect in a manner that completes the project, it must
do so consistently (or, at least not inconsistently) with the remaining criteria
for completion, including the project’s “Plans and Specifications.”
       Think about it by way of example. Imagine the borrowers left the
Meritage’s pool house with vandalized ceiling lights and a cracked foundation,
both defects presumably covered by the “other provisions.” Imagine further
that the project’s plans called for a modest style of recessed lighting and a
particular     foundation      with    particular     dimensions       and    a   particular
composition. Could Western then replace the lights with chandeliers, repair
the foundation in a manner wholly inconsistent with the plans, and



       11 Ohio courts (like most courts) are “permitted to interpret” the word “and” in the
disjunctive “if the sense requires it,” that is, when it would be unreasonable to give the word
its ordinary meaning. Clagg, 695 N.E.2d at 731. We, however, do not see the district court’s
interpretation as unreasonable.
                                              23

                                   No. 16-20546

nevertheless recover its costs from Kaleh? No—those repairs would not
complete the property as Kaleh guaranteed it. In other words, Kaleh (in this
hypothetical) guaranteed a completed pool house of a particular type, and
though the defects entitled Western to repair them, the manner of repair was
not without qualification.
      It may very well be that Western conducted the bulk of its repairs and
improvements in line with the project’s plans. The problem was a lack of proof.
In short, because there was no evidence that the post-foreclosure construction
complied with the “Plans and Specifications,” the district court was left to
speculate as to whether that work in fact brought the project to contractual
completeness. Without evidence of the plans and what they did (or did not)
provide for, and with Western’s damages witness unable to identify the source
or original authenticity of the plans or to tie the incurred costs to them,
Western simply failed to prove its entitlement to recovery. We therefore agree
with the district court’s interpretation of the contract, and we do not see its
corresponding evaluation of the evidence as clearly erroneous.
                             IV.    CONCLUSION
      A summary of our decisions is as follows. First, the district court
correctly identified the governing law. Second, the two-year limitations period
in TEX. PROP. CODE § 51.003(a) is procedural and applies insofar as it bars
Western’s claim for recovery of unpaid debt under the Construction Loan.
Third, the district court shall evaluate on remand whether the Mezzanine
Loan’s promissory note waived notice of acceleration, and in turn, shall
examine the ultimate timeliness of the Mezzanine Guarantee claim and its
constituent parts under the four-year limitations period. Fourth, we find the
Completion Guarantee claim timely. Fifth, we uphold the district court’s denial
of Western’s attorney’s fees. And sixth, we uphold the district court’s denial of

Western’s post-foreclosure construction costs. It will be up to the district court
to recalculate damages upon resolution of the remaining issues.
      The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

v.
Desmond Lee PAULINE, Appellee.
BAP No. NC-90-1288-JAsV, Bankruptcy No. 1-89-00008.
United States Bankruptcy Appellate Panel of the Ninth Circuit.
Argued and Submitted July 26, 1990.

David N. Chandler, Santa Rosa, Cal., for appellant.
Douglas B. Provencher, Santa Rosa, Cal., for appellee.
Before JONES, ASHLAND and VOLINN, Bankruptcy Judges.

OPINION
JONES, Bankruptcy Judge:

I.

OVERVIEW
In response to a motion for abandonment, the bankruptcy court held that Raymond Carey ("Appellant Carey"), the Chapter 7 Trustee for Desmond Lee Pauline ("Debtor"), had sixty (60) days to find a party willing to buy the Debtor's home at a price sufficient to satisfy all of the liens on the home plus the allowed amount of the Debtor's homestead exemption. The court further held that if Appellant Carey did not find such a buyer the Debtor's home would be deemed abandoned. We affirm the court's order.

II.

FACTS
The Debtor filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on January 3, 1989. At the time of the filing, the encumbrances on the Debtor's home, including IRS tax liens and the Debtor's homestead exemption, totalled more than the petition-date value of the home.
Six-months later, Appellant Carey determined that the Debtor's home should be abandoned. In a letter to a creditor of the Debtor dated August 23, 1990, Appellant Carey memorialized this determination by stating in the letter that he was "abandoning [his] trustee interest in the [home]."
Notwithstanding his stated intention to abandon the home, Appellant Carey later reversed himself and decided to sell the home. When the Debtor found out that Appellant Carey intended to sell the home, the Debtor filed a motion urging the bankruptcy court to order the abandonment of the home. After considering the motion, *728 the bankruptcy court gave Appellant Carey sixty (60) days to find a buyer who would be willing to buy the home at a price sufficient to cover all of the liens on the home plus the allowed amount of the Debtor's homestead exemption. The bankruptcy court further stated that in the event no purchaser was found within the sixty day period the property would be deemed abandoned. Appellant Carey timely appealed.

III.

DISCUSSION
We decline to overturn the bankruptcy court's decision for three reasons. First, Appellant Carey failed to object to the Debtor's homestead exemption claim within the thirty day time period established by Bankruptcy Rule 4003(b). As a result, the Debtor's homestead exemption became final with respect to any action which Appellant Carey might have taken against the Debtor's home. See In re Montgomery, 80 B.R. 385, 388 (Bankr.W.D.Tex.1987) ("[I]f no one objects within the time frame established by Bankruptcy Rule 4003(b)[, t]he debtor's entitlement to the [claimed] exemption . . . becomes invulnerable to later attack.")
Second, Appellant Carey's reversal regarding the home was apparently triggered by a realization that if he sold the home, rather than abandoning it, he might be entitled to a trustee's fee on the funds used to satisfy the IRS's tax liens. As such, Appellant Carey's actions would appear to be startlingly similar to those types of property churning actions which 11 U.S.C. § 554 (1986) (the "Abandonment" section) was intended to address. See, e.g., Morgan v. K.C. Machine & Tool Co. (In re K.C. Machine & Tool Co.), 816 F.2d 238, 246 (6th Cir.1987) ("In enacting [section] 554, Congress was aware of the claim that formerly some trustees took burdensome or valueless property into the estate and sold it in order to increase their commissions. Some of the early cases condemned this particular practice[,] . . . and decried the practice of selling burdensome or valueless property simply to obtain a fund for their own administrative expenses." (citing Standard Brass Corp. v. Farmers Nat'l Bank, 388 F.2d 86 (7th Cir.1967); Miller v. Klein (In re Miller), 95 F.2d 441 (7th Cir. 1938); Seaboard Nat'l Bank v. Rogers Milk Products Co., 21 F.2d 414 (2d Cir. 1927))); see also In re Paolella, 79 B.R. 607, 609 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.1987) ("[T]he principle of abandonment was developed . . . to protect the bankruptcy estate from the various costs and burdens of having to administer property which could not conceivably benefit unsecured creditors of the estate." (citation omitted) (emphasis added)).
Lastly, we note that the IRS never asked Appellant Carey to sell the home for its benefit. It is reasonable to assume that the IRS did not ask Appellant Carey to liquidate the IRS's tax liens on the Debtor's home because the IRS felt that it could liquidate the liens at least as efficiently as could Appellant Carey.

IV.

CONCLUSION
Because the Debtor's homestead exemption is final with respect to the Trustee and because the Trustee has apparently engaged in a course of conduct designed to enhance the size of his bank account rather than the size of the funds available for the Debtor's unsecured creditors, we decline to overturn the bankruptcy court's decision.

383 So.2d 146 (1980)
L.L. BEACHAM, Jr.
v.
Mrs. Edith Russell BEACHAM.
Nos. 51940, 51818.
Supreme Court of Mississippi.
April 30, 1980.
Thomas J. Lowe, Jr., Joseph A. Gentile, Jackson, for appellant.
L.L. Beacham, Jr., pro se.
King & Spencer, Robert W. King, Jackson, for appellee.
Before SMITH, P.J., and BROOM and COFER, JJ.
SMITH, Presiding Justice, for the Court.
On February 14, 1967, L.L. Beacham, Jr., appellant, obtained a divorce from appellee, Edith Russell Beacham upon the ground of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment. It was judicially established by the decree that it had been the misconduct of Edith Russell Beacham that was the ground for the divorce, and that L.L. Beacham, Jr. was the aggrieved party. The minor children born of the marriage, who were living with their mother at the time, were allowed to remain with her under the decree. For the support of the children Beacham was directed to pay $200.00 each a month and, in addition, he was directed to pay to their mother $425.00 per month as alimony. Beacham has made the payments required of him for the support of the children who have now reached majority. And, although not all payments have been made on time, he has also paid $425.00 per month to Mrs. Beacham as ordered in the original divorce decree, with the possible exception of some interest on delayed installments.
The situation with regard to these alimony payments has continued unchanged since the original divorce decree in February, 1967, a period of some thirteen years, although Beacham has tried, unsuccessfully, to have the decree modified to reduce or discontinue them.
The present appeal by Beacham is from decrees of the Chancery Court of Hinds County dated June 6, and July 11, 1979, (the cases have been consolidated) rejecting Beacham's requests for modification of the former decree so as to permit him to discontinue payments to Mrs. Beacham and holding him in contempt for failures or delays with respect thereto.
*147 The payments for support of the children were made by Beacham as required, the children had reached their majority before the hearings which resulted in the decrees appealed from were entered, and the children are no longer dependent upon their mother for supervision or parental care.
Leaving aside the several collateral matters which are raised or sought to be raised on the appeals in these cases, there is very little dispute about the substantial or significant facts relating to the circumstances of the parties.
At the time of the divorce, the house and all of its furnishings had become the property of Mrs. Beacham. It is perfectly clear that she is a single woman, in good health, with no dependents and with an income of some $18,000.00 a year, exclusive of any payment of alimony by Mr. Beacham. Mrs. Beacham cannot be characterized as being in any sense a needy person.
At the time of the decrees appealed from, in addition to her substantial income, she had in prospect retirement pay and social security. At the time the divorce decree was entered in 1967, when custody and supervision of the children was left with Mrs. Beacham, apparently so as not to disturb their existing circumstances, it cannot be said at this date that it was unreasonable for the court, in allowing them to remain with their mother, and directing Beacham to make payments for their support, also to award to Mrs. Beacham a sum as alimony in connection with her duties in supervising and looking after the children. It was a matter which can reasonably be considered to have been in the mutual best interest of the parties as well as of the children.
Now that this duty (looking after the children) no longer rests upon Mrs. Beacham and the circumstances are such as no longer to require contributions to Mrs. Beacham from Mr. Beacham upon the basis of any need or otherwise, he should not be required to continue them. Beacham was the innocent party in the divorce and the divorce decree so adjudicated. The destruction of the marriage was the result of misconduct on the part of Mrs. Beacham. Mrs. Beacham no longer has the responsibility of the minor children. She cannot be said to be in any sense needy, in poor health, or unable to lead an independent life with ample means of support without further payment to her of alimony by Beacham. In such circumstances, requiring Beacham to continue to pay alimony to her should cease.
The policy in Mississippi regarding the award of alimony in such a case has long been established. This Court held in Coffee v. Coffee, 145 Miss. 872, 111 So. 377 (1927), that alimony will not be allowed to the wife unless the decree for divorce is in her favor. While exceptions to this rule have been noted in later cases, such as, for instance, where the wife is without estate and has no means of support or the husband's property is an accumulation of the joint efforts of the parties, or where the wife is sick and unable to earn a livelihood. None of these exists in this case.
In Bunkley and Morse's Amis Divorce And Separation in Mississippi, paragraph 6.04 (1957), in concluding a discussion of the rule, it is said: "It should be emphasized that the general rule is that alimony should not be granted to the wife where the separation and divorce are brought about by her acts and conduct. The rule is a sound one and is based on the proposition that a husband is entitled to have his wife receive her support in his home while she is discharging the duties of a wife as imposed under the marriage contract." In the same work the authors refer to Gatlin v. Gatlin, 248 Miss. 868, 161 So.2d 782 (1964), which was a case involving an exception to the general rule in that alimony was allowed to the wrongdoing wife "because of her destitute situation and her poor health, ..." the court holding that the chancellor should have retained jurisdiction even in such a case in order to permit reconsideration when appropriate.
In Russell v. Russell, 241 So.2d 366 (Miss. 1970), this Court had occasion to reexamine and approve the general rule that alimony will not be awarded to a wife whose misconduct was the ground for the husband's *148 divorce. In Russell, supra this Court, after reviewing the authorities, found that Mrs. Russell's situation did not fall within any of the exceptions to the general rule. Moreover, in Russell, although the Court found that Mrs. Russell was not financially independent, it was noted that she had an income from a former husband for the support of his children, the former husband having arranged for them to have a home. The Court found that Mrs. Russell was able to work and considered that she was able to earn her own living. This Court reversed the chancellor who had awarded alimony to Mrs. Russell saying that it could not agree that Mr. Russell should pay her alimony where the chancellor had dissolved the marriage because of her fault.
In the present case there is no dispute that Mrs. Beacham is in the prime of life, enjoying good health, earning a very substantial salary and with every reasonable prospect for a secure future in the form of retirement pay and social security. In this situation, under the rule above stated, it is not necessary to go into the financial status of Mr. Beacham or to point out the undeniable fact that he has been and is in poor health.
It would not be unreasonable to assume that, in awarding alimony to Mrs. Beacham in the decree granting Beacham a divorce, and providing for support of the children in the home with Mrs. Beacham, the chancellor was motivated by a desire to make Mrs. Beacham's task of supervision easier and thus justified the award. However, no matter what prompted the award, no reason whatever now exists justifying the continuance of alimony payments to Mrs. Beacham. As in Russell, supra, it was error not to relieve the former husband of continuing payments to his former wife.
It is unnecessary to pass upon the constitutionality of the Mississippi alimony statute (as it existed prior to the current session of the Mississippi Legislature) under Orr v. Orr, 440 U.S. 268, 99 S.Ct. 1102, 59 L.Ed.2d 306 (1979) nor to pass upon other questions raised not relevant to the central issues.
Alimony is not a bounty to which Mrs. Beacham became entitled to receive indefinitely simply by reason of the fact that at one time she had been married to Beacham. In the divorce decree, it was judicially established that the marriage had been broken up and terminated because of her own misconduct. It cannot be said that she is in any way dependent for a livelihood upon receiving alimony from Beacham. The divorce effectively and finally dissolved and ended their relationship with each other and with it their reciprocal responsibilities. Unless some reason, based upon public policy, could be pointed out that, in good conscience, there is a compelling need to require support from her former husband, he should be relieved of the burden of making contributions to her. No such reason can be pointed out in this case and we are compelled to hold that none exists.
The decrees appealed from will be reversed and a decree entered here relieving Beacham of further payments of alimony to Mrs. Beacham. The case will be remanded to the chancery court for further proceedings with respect to the amounts due Mrs. Beacham which have accrued, from which Beacham is not relieved. It is apparent from the record that Mrs. Beacham is well able from her own means to employ and pay an attorney to represent her and the allowance of attorney's fees on this appeal is denied.

v.

MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
BUCHWALD, District Judge.
Defendant Bear, Stearns Securities Corp. ("Bear Stearns" or "defendant") moves for an order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 157(d) withdrawing the above-captioned adversary proceeding from the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. Plaintiff Helen Gredd ("Gredd" or the "trustee"), the Chapter 11 Trustee for the Manhattan Investment Fund ("the Fund"), opposes the motion. For the reasons that follow, defendant's motion is denied.

BACKGROUND
This is the fourth opinion this Court has issued in this case. See Bear, Stearns Sec. Corp. v. Gredd, 01 Civ. 4379(NRB), 2001 WL 840187 (S.D.N.Y. July 25, 2001) (granting first motion to withdraw reference for Counts II and III of the complaint) ("Gredd I"); Bear, Stearns Sec. Corp. v. Gredd, 275 B.R. 190 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (granting defendant's motion to dismiss Counts II and III) ("Gredd II); In re Manhattan Investment Fund Ltd., 288 B.R. 52 (denying defendant's motion for interlocutory appeal of Bankruptcy Court decision denying motion to dismiss Counts I and IV) ("Gredd III"). The Bankruptcy Court has also issued an opinion in this matter, denying defendant's motion to dismiss Counts I and IV, which are the counts defendant now seeks to have adjudicated before this Court. See In re Manhattan Investment Fund Ltd., 310 B.R. 500 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.2002). Moreover, several other Southern District Judges have issued a total of twelve opinions and orders in civil and criminal cases arising out of the same underlying facts. Consequently, we assume familiarity with the facts, and provide only a brief overview of the relevant procedural history below.
This action arises out of a Ponzi scheme engineered by Michael Berger, the Fund's manager, who sought to cover losses from ill-advised short sales of technology stocks with deposits made by new investors. The results were disastrous; the Fund hemorrhaged hundreds of millions of dollars and Mr. Berger was criminally prosecuted, pleading guilty to securities fraud.[1] The instant matter involves the Fund trustee's efforts to avoid certain transfers she alleges to be fraudulent.
In Gredd I, we granted Bear Stearns' motion to withdraw the reference for *66 Counts II and III of the complaint for the limited purpose of determining "whether the proceeds generated from short sales of stock, and the securities later purchased to cover those short sales, constituted `interest[s] of the debtor in property' within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. § 548(a)(1)(A)." Gredd II, 275 B.R. at 191. Before ruling, we considered and rejected Bear Stearns' proposal to withdraw the entire reference, determining that a partial withdrawal best served the interests of judicial efficiency. See, e.g., Aff. of Daniel E. Reynolds, Ex. 33 (Daniel J. Kramer Letter dated 7/12/02 arguing for full withdrawal). Subsequently, in Gredd II, we dismissed Counts II and III, remanding Counts I and IV to the Bankruptcy Court. See Gredd II, 275 B.R. at 199. After the Bankruptcy Court denied its motion to dismiss Counts I and IV, Bear Stearns moved pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 158(a)(3) and Fed. R. Bankr.P. 8001(b) and 8003 for leave to appeal the Bankruptcy Court's decision. In Gredd III, we denied that motion.
Count I seeks to avoid allegedly fraudulent transfers of margin payments made by the Fund to Bear Stearns. Count IV alleges that, to the extent to which the trustee is successful in this case, any claims made or liens asserted by Bear Stearns in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding should be subordinated to all other claims pursuant to 11 U.S.C. §§ 105 and 510(c). Two days after the close of discovery in the Bankruptcy Court, Bear Stearns again moved this Court to withdraw the reference for Counts I and IV pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 157(d), asserting that, "[n]ow that discovery is complete, it is now clear that Counts I and IV now require substantial and material consideration of federal securities law." Def. Mem. of Law at 1.[2] The trustee opposes the motion on three grounds: first, that the motion is barred by the law of the case doctrine; second, that it is untimely; and third, that Bear Stearns has failed to meet the statutory standard for mandatory withdrawal. We now find that each of the first two grounds provides an independent basis to deny the motion, and accordingly remand the case to the Bankruptcy Court for resolution of Bear Stearns' motion for summary judgment.

DISCUSSION
I. Standard for Mandatory Withdrawal under 28 U.S.C. § 157(d)
As we explained in Gredd I, despite the broad language of § 157(d), which if read literally "could result in a broad escape hatch through which most bankruptcy matters [could] be removed to a district court," In re Combustion Equip. Assocs., 67 B.R. 709, 711 (S.D.N.Y.1986) (internal quotation and citation omitted), courts have narrowly construed the mandatory withdrawal provision to apply only in cases "where substantial and material consideration of non-Bankruptcy Code federal statutes is necessary for the resolution of the proceeding." In re Ionosphere Clubs, Inc., 922 F.2d 984, 995 (2d Cir.1990) (citing In re White Motor Corp., 42 B.R. 693, 700 (N.D.Ohio 1984)). Consideration *67 is "substantial and material" when the case requires the bankruptcy judge to make a "significant interpretation, as opposed to simple application, of federal non-bankruptcy statutes." In re CIS Corp., 172 B.R. 748, 753 (S.D.N.Y.1994); see also City of New York v. Exxon Corp., 932 F.2d 1020, 1026 (2nd Cir.1991) (citations omitted); In re Revere Copper & Brass Inc., 172 B.R. 192, 196 (S.D.N.Y.1994); In re Adelphi Inst., Inc., 112 B.R. 534, 536 (S.D.N.Y.1990). Moreover, "where matters of first impression are concerned, the burden of establishing a right to mandatory withdrawal is more easily met." Mishkin v. Ageloff, 220 B.R. 784, 796 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (citing In re Keene Corp., 182 B.R. 379, 382 (S.D.N.Y.1995) and In re Ionosphere Clubs, 103 B.R. 416, 419-20 (S.D.N.Y.1989)).
II. Analysis
A. The Law of the Case Doctrine
The law of the case is a discretionary doctrine, providing "that where a court decides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case." Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 618-19, 103 S.Ct. 1382, 75 L.Ed.2d 318 (1983). While the law of the case is "a discretionary doctrine which does not constitute a limitation on the court's power but merely expresses the general practice of refusing to reopen what has been decided," Brody v. Village of Port Chester, 345 F.3d 103, 110 (2d Cir. 2003) (citations and internal quotations omitted), nonetheless, the situations justifying reconsideration are generally limited to "an intervening change of controlling law, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent manifest injustice." Doe v. New York City Dep't of Soc. Svcs., 709 F.2d 782, 789 (2d Cir.1983) (quoting 18B C. Wright, A. Miller & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 4478, at 790 (1981) (footnote omitted) (additional citations omitted)). Bear Stearns argues that the doctrine is inapplicable here. We disagree.
Bear Stearns suggests that because it "did not make the arguments submitted to the Court here in [its] earlier motions, and the Court did not reject those arguments," the doctrine does not apply. While it is accurate that the decision in Gredd I did not address the arguments now raised by Bear Stearns, it is also the case that Bear Stearns sought to withdraw the entire proceeding at that time, a proposal this Court rejected in favor of a partial withdrawal relating only to the securities law issues raised by Counts II and III. At oral argument during Gredd I, counsel for Bear Stearns urged the Court to withdraw the entire proceeding, arguing that "Count 1 . . . relates to margin payments, which is, of course, part of the federal securities scheme. It's not a stretch to take the whole case. It all involves the securities industry." Tr. of Oral Arg. at 21. Ultimately, we decided that only Counts II and III raised issues requiring "substantial and material" consideration of the securities laws, and only adjudicated those two counts, remanding Counts I and IV to the Bankruptcy Court. The law of the case doctrine is thus clearly applicable, as this Court has already issued a ruling in which it declined to withdraw the reference for Counts I and IV. Moreover, this is a particularly suitable occasion for application of the doctrine, as it comports with the basic principle that parties must raise their arguments at the first opportunity or waive them. In 2001, the Court held oral argument on the first motion to withdraw the reference, at which point Bear Stearns was permitted to, and did, argue for withdrawal of the entire reference. Were we now to entertain a *68 motion to withdraw Counts I and IV, we would be permitting re-litigation of an issue already decided in the absence of an intervening change in the law or facts that would provide a "cogent" or "compelling" reason for this Court to do so.
B. Timeliness
Even if the instant motion were not barred by the law of the case doctrine, it would nonetheless be rejected for untimeliness. By its plain language, 28 U.S.C. § 157(d) requires that motions to withdraw be "timely." Thus, even if we were to accept that Bear Stearns is now raising new arguments, Bear Stearns would have to satisfactorily explain why it has waited almost five years to argue for withdrawal of Counts I and IV. Bear Stearns' suggestion that "the Trustee likely would have protested" if Bear Stearns had made its motion during discovery, rather than at its conclusion, does not excuse its extraordinary delay. See, e.g., In re FMI Forwarding Co., Inc., 01 Civ. 9462(DAB), 2005 WL 147298 at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 24, 2005) (noting that "courts in the Circuit have defined `timely' to mean as soon as possible after the moving party has notice of the grounds for withdrawing the reference") (internal citation and quotations omitted). In fact, courts in this district have held that a delay of several months in making a motion to withdraw a reference to the Bankruptcy Court may be untimely. See, e.g., Connolly v. Bidermann Indus. U.S.A., Inc., 05 Civ. 1791(RPP), 1996 WL 325575 at *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 13, 1996) (nine month delay renders motion untimely); In re New York Trap Rock Corp., 158 B.R. 574, 577 (S.D.N.Y.1993) (three month delay). We thus find that untimeliness provides an alternative basis to reject Bear Stearns' motion.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, Bear Stearns' second motion to withdraw the reference is denied. The case is hereby remanded to the Bankruptcy Court for further proceedings.
SO ORDERED.
NOTES
[1]  Mr. Berger failed to appear for his sentencing and remains a fugitive.
[2]  Specifically, Bear Stearns contends that determining who can be considered a "transferee" under § 550(a) of the Bankruptcy Code requires consideration of federal regulations governing "margin transactions and broker utilization of customer funds." Levitin v. PaineWebber, 159 F.3d 698, 705 (2d Cir.1998). As an example of a federal regulation implicated by Count I, Bear Stearns points to SEC Rule 15c3-3(e)(2), which it claims to "specifically prohibit[] broker-dealers from using customer funds . . . for the broker-dealer's own propriety [sic] purposes or for any other non-customer transactions." Def. Mem. of Law at 4. Because we have determined that withdrawal is inappropriate, we do not consider the substance of Bear Stearns' arguments here.

MEMORANDUM OPINION
EMMET G. SULLIVAN, District Judge.
Plaintiffs are twenty-two urban hospitals seeking additional reimbursement from the Secretary of Health and Human Services ("defendant" or the "Secretary") for inpatient services plaintiffs provided to Medicare beneficiaries during fiscal years ("FY") 2000 and 2001.[2] The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment, which this Court referred to a magistrate judge for a Report and Recommendation. Now pending before the Court are the parties' objections to the Report and Recommendation. Upon careful consideration of the Report and Recommendation, the parties' objections and responses to objections, the cross motions, responses and replies thereto, the applicable law, the entire record herein, and for the reasons stated below, the Court rejects the magistrate judge's recommendations, GRANTS defendant's motion for summary judgment, and DENIES plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment.

I. BACKGROUND

A. Medicare Reimbursement and the Prospective Payment System
The Medicare program, established by Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1395 et seq., pays for covered *20 medical services provided to eligible aged and disabled persons. Part A of the Medicare program authorizes payments for, among other things, certain inpatient hospital services. See id. §§ 1395c, 1395d. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") (formerly known as the Health Care Financing Administration ("HCFA")) is the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services that has been designated by the Secretary to administer the Medicare program. CMS, in turn, has delegated many of Medicare's audit and payment functions to fiscal intermediaries, who are generally private insurers. See id. § 1395h.
Although hospitals used to be reimbursed for their actual costs in treating beneficiaries (as long as those costs were reasonable), most hospitals are now reimbursed through the Prospective Payment System ("PPS"). See id. § 1395ww(d). Under the PPS, hospitals are "paid fixed rates for providing specific categories of treatment, known as `diagnosis related groups,' or `DRGs.'" Bellevue Hosp. Ctr. v. Leavitt, 443 F.3d 163, 168 (2d Cir.2006) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 1395ww(d)). Medicare administrators develop these rates by setting a "standard nationwide cost ratethe `federal rate'based on the average operating costs of inpatient hospital services. They then assign a weight to each category of inpatient treatment, or [DRG]." Methodist Hosp. of Sacramento v. Shalala, 38 F.3d 1225, 1227 (D.C.Cir.1994) (internal citation omitted). A hospital's final reimbursement per patient is determined by multiplying the patient's DRG and the federal rate, after that rate has been "standardized" by making adjustments based on a variety of factors. See 42 U.S.C. § 1395ww(d)(2)(C) (listing the factors used for standardization).
To account for regional variations in labor costs, the Secretary adjusts the labor-related portion of the federal rate by a geographically specific factor commonly referred to as the "wage index." See 42 U.S.C. § 1395ww(d)(3)(E)(i). Specifically, § 1395ww(d)(3)(E)(i) states that
the Secretary shall adjust the proportion, (as estimated by the Secretary from time to time) of hospitals' costs which are attributable to wages and wage-related costs, of the DRG prospective payment rates computed under subparagraph (D) for area differences in hospital wage levels by a factor (established by the Secretary) reflecting the relative hospital wage level in the geographic area of the hospital compared to the national average hospital wage level.
Id.; see also Robert Wood Johnson Univ. Hosp. v. Thompson, 297 F.3d 273, 276 (3d Cir.2002) ("The wage index compares the average hourly wage for hospitals in a given geographic area with the national average hourly wage, which in turn determines the payment rate above or below the national average at which a hospital is reimbursed. The wage-index for an area generally applies to all hospitals physically located within that geographic area." (internal citation omitted)).

B. Geographic Classification, Reclassification, and the Impact on the Wage Index
For the purposes of the wage index, the Secretary classifies a hospital as being located in either an urban or rural area using Metropolitan Statistical Areas ("MSAs"), as defined by the Executive Office of Management and Budget. See 42 C.F.R. § 412.64. Recognizing that these geographic classification procedures impose a burden on some hospitals,[3] Congress *21 amended the Medicare statute "to allow a hospital to seek reclassification from its geographically-based wage area to a nearby wage area for payment purposes if it meets certain criteria." Robert Wood Johnson, 297 F.3d at 276. The current reclassification provisions permit a rural hospital that meets those criteria to reclassify as urban, and qualifying urban hospitals to reclassify either as rural or to another higher-wage urban area. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395ww(d)(8)(B)(i) & (d)(10); 42 C.F.R. §§ 412.230-412.235. Congress also created the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board, a five-member entity that reviews reclassification applications and, based on the specified requirements, decides whether an applicant is eligible for reclassification. See 42 U.S.C. § 1395ww(d)(10); 42 C.F.R. § 412.230.
Both Congress and the Secretary have recognized that hospital reclassification can substantially impact the wage index for both the geographic area from which a hospital originates and the new area into which the hospital classifies. The Medicare program therefore provides for circumstances when the wage index data for an incoming rural hospital must be excluded from the wage index of the urban area it is entering. 42 U.S.C. § 1395ww(d)(8)(C)(i)(I)-(II). Likewise, Congress implemented a provision to prevent the wage index of a rural area from decreasing when a hospital originating from that area reclassifies into an urban area.[4]See id. § 1395ww(d)(8)(C)(ii). No such statutory provision exists for urban areas, but no reclassification may result in the reduction of a wage index of any county below that of the State's rural areas.[5]See id. § 1395ww(d)(8)(C)(iii); see also Def.'s Objections to Magistrate Judge's Report & Recommendation ("Def.'s Objections") at 5 ("[T]he Act is silent with respect to how to calculate the wage index for an urban area after a hospital has reclassified to another area...."). Plaintiffs in this lawsuit challenge the Secretary's since-changed practice of calculating the wage index for urban areas without including data from hospitals that have reclassified into higher-wage areas.

C. Reclassification and Urban Wage Indexes
The Secretary annually publishes rules in the Federal Register setting forth both the methodology for calculating the wage index and the wage indexes themselves. Beginning in 1991, the Secretary publicly acknowledged the increase in urban reclassifications and, through notice and comment rulemaking, considered various methods to calculate the wage index for urban areas in the wake of such reclassifications. Despite proposals to implement a "hold harmless" provision for urban hospitals similar to the statutory provision in place for rural areas, the Secretary repeatedly declined to do so. See, e.g., 65 Fed. Reg. 47054, 47077 (Aug. 1, 2000) ("[E]xcept for those rural areas in which redesignation would reduce the rural wage index value, the wage index value for each area is computed exclusive of the wage data for hospitals that have been redesignated from the area for purposes of their wage index."); 56 Fed. Reg. 43196, 43221 (Aug. 30, 1991) ("[W]e considered ... provid[ing] *22 the same `hold harmless' protection that the statute affords to rural areas when hospitals are reclassified from those areas. That is, we considered providing that the wage index value for an urban area could not be reduced due to the reclassification of hospitals from that area. However, we do not believe this action would be appropriate.").
In 2001, however, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission ("MedPAC") issued a report to Congress recommending that the Medicare statute be amended to provide a "hold harmless" provision for urban areas. See Def.'s S.J. Mem. at 10-11 (citing Medicare Payment Advisory Comm'n, Report to the Congress: Medicare Payment Policy 82 (Mar. 2001), http://www.medpac.gov/documents/Mar01% 20 Entire% 20report.pdf ("MedPAC Report"), and describing the contents of the report). The report expressed MedPAC's opinion that the Secretary had the authority to make such a change by way of regulation, but noted that the agency had been "reluctant" to do so. MedPAC Report at 83 ("HCFA appears to have the authority to make this change through regulation. However, because the protection for nonreclassified rural hospitals was enacted legislatively and Congress has not legislated such protection for urban hospitals, HCFA has thus far been reluctant to make the change itself.").
Shortly thereafter, the Secretary did in fact propose implementing a "hold harmless" provision for urban areas, and discussed the MedPAC Report and its findings in the proposed rule. See 66 Fed. Reg. 22646, 22678 (May 4, 2001). The rule was adopted in August 2001 and has been in effect since FY 2002. See 66 Fed. Reg. 39828, 39865 (Aug. 1, 2001) ("Currently, the wage index value for an urban area is calculated exclusive of the wage data for hospitals that have been reclassified to another area. For the FY 2002 wage index, we include the wage data for a reclassified urban hospital in both the area to which it is reclassified and the MSA where the hospital is physically located.").

D. Administrative and Judicial Review
To receive reimbursement for services, hospitals file "cost report[s]" with their intermediaries at the end of each fiscal year. 42 C.F.R. § 405.1801(b)(1). Intermediaries then audit the reports and determine the reimbursement amount owed to the providers. That determination is memorialized in a Notice of Program Reimbursement and issued to the provider. Id. § 405.1803(a)(2).
A hospital or group of hospitals dissatisfied with an intermediary's reimbursement determination may file an appeal with the Provider Review Reimbursement Board ("PRRB"). See 42 U.S.C. § 1395oo(a)-(b). The PRRB is "an administrative review panel that has the power to conduct an evidentiary hearing and affirm, modify, or reverse the intermediary's [reimbursement] determination." Your Home Visiting Nurse Servs., Inc. v. Shalala, 525 U.S. 449, 451, 119 S.Ct. 930, 142 L.Ed.2d 919 (1999). Additionally, both the statute and the corresponding regulations provide a mechanism for the PRRB to grant expedited judicial review ("EJR") where the PRRB determines that it lacks the authority to decide a legal issue:
Providers shall ... have the right to obtain judicial review of any action of the fiscal intermediary which involves a question of law or regulations relevant to the matters in controversy whenever the Board determines (on its own motion or at the request of a provider of services...) that it is without authority to decide the question, by a civil action commenced within sixty days of the date *23 on which notification of such determination is received.
42 U.S.C. § 1395oo(f)(1); see also 42 C.F.R. § 405.1842(f)(1)(ii) (noting that before issuing an EJR decision, the PRRB must determine that it "lacks the authority to decide a specific legal question relevant to the specific matter at issue because the legal question is a challenge either to the constitutionality of a provision of a statute, or to the substantive or procedural validity of a regulation or CMS Ruling").

E. Factual and Procedural Background
Plaintiffs are hospitals located in multiple MSAs in New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut from which at least one hospital has classified to another area. See Compl. ¶¶ 3, 15. In FY 2000 and 2001, plaintiffs submitted cost reports to their fiscal intermediaries requesting reimbursement. Def.'s Statement of Material Facts as to Which There is No Genuine Issue ("Def.'s Statement") ¶ 3. Plaintiffs were dissatisfied with their Notices of Program Reimbursement because they believed that the data from reclassified hospitals was improperly omitted from the wage-index calculation, the exclusion of which resulted in reduced reimbursements.[6] Def.'s Statement ¶ 4; Compl. ¶¶ 15, 20.
On appeal to the PRRB, plaintiffs requested (1) consolidation into group appeals for FY 2000 and 2001, and (2) EJR. See Def.'s Statement ¶ 5; Admin. Record ("AR") at 432-33. The PRRB determined that EJR was appropriate in both cases because the PRRB was "without the authority to decide the legal question" presented by plaintiffs' challenge to the reimbursement determination. AR at 2. Specifically, the PRRB noted that plaintiffs were not seeking the type of relief "correction of [plaintiffs'] own wage data"that PRRB could provide. AR at 2. "Rather, they are seeking to have the wages of reclassified hospitals included in their wage index calculation." AR at 2. Because such a remedy would require an evaluation of the lawfulness of the Secretary's interpretation of the Medicare statute, the PRRB concluded that EJR was appropriate. AR at 2.
As required by 42 U.S.C. § 1395oo(f)(1), plaintiffs filed the instant complaints within sixty days of the PRRB's respective EJR determinations. After the cases were consolidated in this Court, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. In December 2008, the Court referred the case to a magistrate judge for a Report and Recommendation. The magistrate judge filed her Report and Recommendation on March 19, 2009, 2009 WL 762897, recommending that both motions for summary judgment be denied and that the action "be remanded to the Secretary for the articulation of findings, as to each provider which is a Plaintiff in this action, with respect to what `adjustment' was made pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1395ww(d)(3)(E)." Report & Recommendation at 9.
In reaching this recommendation, the magistrate judge reasoned that "the absence from the administrative record of any indication of how CMS interpreted and applied 42 U.S.C. § 1395ww(d)(3)(E)" prevented judicial review of a final agency action. Id. at 6. The Report and Recommendation thus concluded that "[i]n the absence of any record in the administrative record of what determination CMS made with respect to the adjustments, and *24 what factors were considered in making such adjustments, the court has no basis upon which to determine whether CMS's determinations were contrary to law, or otherwise arbitrary and capricious." Id. at 6-7. Noting that calculating the reimbursement rates applicable to plaintiffs "would require a virtually trial-like proceeding for the resolution of the disputed factual issues," the magistrate judge instead recommended that the case be remanded to the agency for further factual development of the record. Id. at 7.
Both plaintiffs and defendant have filed objections to the Report and Recommendation. Those objections have been fully briefed and are now ripe for decision.

II. Report and Recommendation
Both parties object to the Report and Recommendation's findings that (1) the administrative record does not make clear how CMS calculated the wage indexes challenged in this case or "what factors were considered in making such adjustments," Report & Recommendation at 6; and (2) the record does not contain sufficient information about the financial impact of the Secretary's calculations on the amount of plaintiffs' reimbursement, see id. at 7. More generally, the parties object to the Report and Recommendation's conclusion that the PRRB's decision does not constitute a final action, and agree that remand is unnecessary because the PRRB properly granted EJR.
"When a party files written objections to any part of the magistrate judge's recommendation with respect to a dispositive motion, the Court considers de novo those portions of the recommendation to which objections have been made, and `may accept, reject, or modify the recommended decision[.]'" Robinson v. Winter, 457 F.Supp.2d 32, 33 (D.D.C.2006) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b)). Upon careful review of both the Report and Recommendation and the parties' objections thereto, the Court respectfully disagrees with the magistrate judge's determination that remand is necessary to develop the factual development in this case.
As noted by the parties, "the sole issue" before this Court is a legal question whether the Secretary's practice of excluding data from reclassified hospitals in calculating the wage indexes for the hospitals remaining in those urban areas violated 42 U.S.C. § 1395ww(d)(3)(E). Pls.' Statement of Material Facts as to Which There is No Genuine Issue ("Pls.' Statement") ¶ 3; see also Def.'s Response to Pls.' Statement of Material Facts as to Which There is No Genuine Issue ¶ 3 ("The sole issue is whether federal law mandated that the Secretary include reclassified hospitals located in the Plaintiffs' geographic area in the wage index calculation for the remaining hospitals."). The parties do not dispute that this data was in fact excluded from the FY 2000 and 2001 calculation of the wage indexes for plaintiffs' geographic areas, and, as the parties explain in their summary judgment briefing and respective objections, the Secretary's reasons for maintaining the challenged policy were explained in detail in the Federal Register. See, e.g., 56 Fed. Reg. 43196, 43221 (Aug. 30, 1991) (explaining why the Secretary was rejecting proposals to implement a "hold harmless" provision for urban hospitals).
The Report and Recommendation correctly notesand the parties fully acknowledge that the administrative record does not contain factual information sufficient to determine the precise amount of additional reimbursement to which plaintiffs would be entitled if they were to prevail in their legal argument. See Pls.' Objections at 9-10 (explaining that some of the relevant information is in the administrative record, but acknowledging that the Secretary and/or intermediary would have *25 to recalculate the exact amount at issue); Def.'s Objections at 11-12 (noting that the administrative record "contains little beyond the documents needed to establish the PRRB's jurisdiction over each of the Plaintiffs"). But this deficiency in the record does not create a material factual dispute preventing the Court from resolving the legal question raised here.[7]
Moreover, the PRRB's determination that it lacked the authority to decide the legal question raised by plaintiffs was in full compliance with 42 U.S.C. § 1395oo(f)(1), which explicitly contemplates the situation presented by this case. See Hunterdon/Somerset 2001 Wage Index Group v. Riverbend Gov't Benefits Adm'r, PRRB Hearing Dec. No. 2004-D13, Case No. 01-1881GE (Apr. 14, 2004), AR at 438 (finding, on its own motion, that EJR was warranted because "the facts material to the issue are not in dispute. The questions posed by the Providers as requiring Board resolution are questions regarding how CMS's policy is made. The Board has no authority to dictate or fashion CMS policy or to retroactively apply policy changes."); see also Robert Wood Johnson, 297 F.3d at 279-80 (acknowledging the court's jurisdiction after the PRRB granted EJR; noting that the court's review was "limited to the issue before the PRRB regarding the Secretary's interpretation" of the statute relevant in that case). Because 42 U.S.C. § 1395oo(f)(1) has been properly invoked, the PRRB's EJR decision constitutes a final decision, see 42 C.F.R. § 405.1842(h)(1), and plaintiffs "have the right to obtain judicial review" of the calculation of their wage index for FY 2000 and 2001, "which involves a question of law or regulations relevant to the matters in controversy." 42 U.S.C. § 1395oo(f)(1). This Court therefore rejects the magistrate judge's recommendation and will proceed to address the merits of the parties' cross motions for summary judgment.

III. SUMMARY JUDGMENT

A. Standard of Review
Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, summary judgment should be granted if the moving party has shown that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56; Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); Waterhouse v. District of Columbia, 298 F.3d 989, 991 (D.C.Cir.2002). In determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the court must view all facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). Likewise, in ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment, the court shall grant summary judgment only if one of the moving parties is entitled to judgment as a matter of law upon material facts that are not genuinely disputed. See Rhoads v. McFerran, 517 F.2d 66, 67 (2d Cir.1975).[8]
*26 Plaintiffs' principal claim is that the Secretary exceeded her statutory authority and that her actions must be set aside pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C), which permits a court to "hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be ... in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right." As the D.C. Circuit has explained, "[i]n examining the Secretary's interpretation of a statute that she administers, the court applies the familiar methodology of Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984)." Methodist Hosp. of Sacramento, 38 F.3d at 1229. The court's first question must be "whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue." Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842, 104 S.Ct. 2778. "If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress." Id. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778.
The court moves to the second step of Chevron only "if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue." Id. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778. Under those circumstances, the court must consider whether the agency's interpretation "is based on a permissible construction of the statute." Id. If so, then the court "must defer to the Secretary's" interpretation. Methodist Hosp. of Sacramento, 38 F.3d at 1229. Where Congress has implicitly delegated authority to the agency to fill a gap left in the statutory framework, "a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency." Chevron, 467 U.S. at 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778.
Finally, "in framing the scope of review, the court takes special note of the tremendous complexity of the Medicare statute. That complexity adds to the deference which is due to the Secretary's decision." Methodist Hosp. of Sacramento, 38 F.3d at 1229 (giving heightened deference to the Secretary's policy of denying retroactive effect to a revised wage index); see also Robert Wood Johnson, 297 F.3d at 282 ("The broad deference of Chevron is even more appropriate in cases that involve a `complex and highly technical regulatory program,'" such as Medicare, which "require[s] significant expertise and entail[s] the exercise of judgment grounded in policy concerns.'" (quoting Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U.S. 504, 512, 114 S.Ct. 2381, 129 L.Ed.2d 405 (1994) (additional citations omitted))).

B. 42 U.S.C. § 1395ww(d)(3)(E)(i) Does Not Speak to the Precise Question at Issue
Plaintiffs challenge the Secretary's exclusion of wage data of reclassified hospitals from the calculation of their wage indexes under § 1395ww(d)(3)(E)(i). As noted above, the statute requires the Secretary to
adjust the proportion ... of the DRG prospective payment rates computed under subparagraph (D) for area differences in hospital wage levels by a factor (established by the Secretary) reflecting the relative hospital wage level in the geographic area of the hospital compared to the national average hospital wage level.
(Emphasis added.)
Plaintiffs argue that this provision is "clear and unambiguous" in requiring the Secretary to include the wage data of reclassified hospitals, which are "by definition `in the geographic area' of" plaintiff hospitals, in the calculation of the wage index. Pls.' Mem. at 6-7. In support of this argument, plaintiffs rely heavily on two cases: Bellevue Hospital Center v. *27 Leavitt, 443 F.3d 163 (2d Cir.2006), and Anna Jacques Hospital v. Leavitt, 537 F.Supp.2d 24 (D.D.C.2008).[9] As discussed below, neither of these cases supports plaintiffs' position.
In Bellevue, the Second Circuit addressed two issues. First, it considered and rejected the plaintiff hospitals' challenge to the agency's use of MSAs in defining the "geographic areas" referred to in § 1395ww(d)(3)(E)(i). At the outset, the Bellevue court acknowledged that the agency's "task" under § 1395ww(d)(3)(E)(i) "is unambiguous: to calculate a factor that reflects geographic-area wage-level differences, and nothing else." 443 F.3d at 174. Plaintiffs in this case take this conclusion to mean that "the first sentence of § 1395ww(d)(3)(E)(i) is unambiguous, period." Pls.' Reply at 5.
Plaintiff's reliance on Bellevue, however, fails to account for the remainder of the Bellevue court's discussion regarding the term "geographic area":
At the same time, ... the statute leaves considerable ambiguity as to the term "geographic area," which, based only on the literal language of the provision, could be as large as a several-state region or as small as a city block. CMS's discretion in interpreting this ambiguous term is cabined by the need to fulfill two somewhat contradictory policies ...:(1) the geographic areas must be small enough to actually reflect differences in wage levels and, (2) each geographic area must include enough hospitals that their costs can be meaningfully averaged and individual hospitals do not get reimbursed for their own actual costs. In balancing these two considerations, the agency has considerable discretion. Moreover, even after determining the scale of each geographic area, lines must be drawn between areas that inevitably will be contested and may seem arbitrary; once again, the statute is silent as to how this process is to take place, leaving the agency with broad discretion.

Bellevue, 443 F.3d at 175 (emphasis added); see id. (concluding that "the use of MSAs to fill the gap left by the ambiguous term `geographic areas' is reasonable").
To the extent that Bellevue's reasoning is applicable in the present case, it actually undermines plaintiffs' position that § 1395ww(d)(3)(E)(i) unambiguously requires the Secretary to include particular hospitals in calculating "the relative hospital wage level in the geographic area" of plaintiff hospitals. Just as the Bellevue court concluded that § 1395ww(d)(3)(E)(i) leaves discretion to the agency to use MSAs in determining the geographic area of a hospital for the purposes of the wage index, so too does the statute leave open the question of whether a hospital should be treated as located "in the geographic area" from which it has reclassified.
The second issue addressed in Bellevue whether the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously in collecting certain data relating to the occupational mix of employees is simply irrelevant to the case at bar. Plaintiff's reliance on Anna Jacques is misplaced for the same reason. Indeed, although Anna Jacques addressed the wage index under § 1395ww(d)(3)(E)(i), that case concerned the agency's interpretation of its obligation under the second sentence of the statutory provision to gather data for use in the calculation of wage indexes. See § 1395ww(d)(3)(E)(i) ("[T]he Secretary shall update the factor under the preceding sentence on the basis of a survey conducted by the Secretary (and *28 updated as appropriate) of the wages and wage-related costs of subsection (d) hospitals in the United States."). Specifically, the Anna Jacques court considered the scope of the Secretary's discretion to determine what types of hospitals should be included in the survey that the Secretary is required to conduct before updating the wage index. See 537 F.Supp.2d at 31 (concluding that the statute did not give the Secretary discretion to exclude critical access hospitals from the survey, because "the plain language of the statute indicates that Congress required the Secretary to conduct an accurate survey of the wages and wage-related costs of subsection (d) hospitals," and exclusion of critical access hospitals would not "faithfully reflect" that information). Anna Jacques thus addressed an entirely different part of § 1395ww(d)(3)(E)(i), one that deals with the collection of wage-index data rather than the calculation of a wage index after that data has been gathered. Accordingly, the Anna Jacques court's holding that the second sentence of the statute is unambiguous does not shed light on whether or not the first sentence of the statute clearly requires the Secretary to include the data from reclassified hospitals in its calculation.
Reading the statutory framework as a whole reinforces the conclusion that § 1395ww(d)(3)(E)(i) does not unambiguously require the Secretary to include reclassified hospitals in the geographic area where they are physically located. Of particular note in this regard are the other subsections of § 1395ww(d) that explicitly (1) "hold harmless" rural hospitals, § 1395ww(d)(8)(C)(ii); and (2) set the "rural floor" below which no wage index may fall as a result of reclassification, § 1395ww(d)(8)(C)(iii). Plaintiffs' reading of § 1395ww(d)(3)(E)(i) would render these subsections superfluous, because § 1395ww(d)(3)(E)(i) would already protect against the concerns addressed by those provisions. See TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31, 122 S.Ct. 441, 151 L.Ed.2d 339 (2001) ("It is a cardinal principle of statutory construction that a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant." (internal quotation marks omitted)).
In sum, the Court agrees with the Secretary that 42 U.S.C. § 1395ww(d)(3)(E)(i) does not clearly address how the Secretary must treat wage data from hospitals that have reclassified to a different area in calculating the wage index. See Def.'s S.J. Mem. at 16. Although § 1395ww(d)(3)(E)(i) unambiguously requires the Secretary to "establish" a "factor" that reflects "the relative hospital wage level in the geographic area of the hospital," the language leaves substantial discretion to the Secretary in determining what constitutes both the "relative wage level" and the relevant "geographic area." Cf. Bellevue Hosp. Ctr., 443 F.3d at 174. The Court must therefore proceed to the second step of Chevron to consider whether the Secretary's policy of excluding data from reclassified hospitals from the calculation of plaintiffs' wage indexes was based on a "permissible construction" of § 1395ww(d)(3)(E)(i).

C. The Secretary's Interpretation is Reasonable
Having concluded that the statute does not address the precise question at issue, the Court must consider whether the Secretary's interpretation of § 1395ww(d)(3)(E)(i) was reasonable and, if so, must defer to that interpretation. See Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778. Plaintiffs rely primarily on the Secretary's decision to implement the "hold harmless" provision for FY 2002 in arguing that the agency's prior practice of excluding the wage data of reclassified *29 hospital was based on an impermissible construction of § 1395ww(d)(3)(E)(i). Put differently, plaintiffs claim that because the Secretary was able to effectuate the change in wage-index calculation without a change to the statutory or regulatory framework, the statute must have already required the inclusion of reclassified hospitals as part of the "geographic area."
The Secretary responds that because the statute is silent as to the inclusion of reclassified hospitals' wage data, the agency was not only permitted to change its practice but was required to do so when information gained through the administration of the program led the Secretary to conclude that inclusion of the data was the preferable approach. Here the Secretary relies on a long line of cases, including Chevron, recognizing that an agency should not be prevented from adapting its policies when circumstances counsel in favor of such a change. See Def.'s S.J. Mem. at 23 (citing cases). Indeed, the Supreme Court in Chevron made this point particularly clearly:
An initial agency interpretation is not instantly carved in stone. On the contrary, the agency, to engage in informed rulemaking, must consider varying interpretations and the wisdom of its policy on a continuing basis. Moreover, the fact that the agency has adopted different definitions in different contexts adds force to the argument that the definition itself is flexible, particularly since Congress has never indicated any disapproval of a flexible reading of the statute.
467 U.S. at 863-64, 104 S.Ct. 2778; see also Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N.A., 517 U.S. 735, 742, 116 S.Ct. 1730, 135 L.Ed.2d 25 (1996) ("[T]he mere fact that an agency interpretation contradicts a prior agency position is not fatal.... [C]hange is not invalidating, since the whole point of Chevron is to leave the discretion provided by the ambiguities of a statute with the implementing agency.").
The Court rejects plaintiffs' attempt to fault the Secretary for doing precisely what the Chevron Court envisionedevaluating "the wisdom of [the agency's] policy on a continuing basis." Indeed, the Federal Register passages repeatedly referenced and discussed by the parties make clear that the Secretary carefully considered whether the Medicare statute should be interpreted to include a "hold harmless" provision for urban hospitals. The Secretary originally rejected this interpretation because of the concern that including reclassified hospitals in their original labor markets would (1) disrupt the statutory scheme, which specifically enumerated the circumstances under which reclassified hospitals should be included in the calculations of their originating geographic area; and (2) negatively impact the majority of hospitals by requiring that the overall standardized rate be reduced to comport with a budget-neutrality requirement contained in the statute. See 56 Fed. Reg. at 43221.
When the agency reevaluated this interpretation in 2001, its rationale for doing so was clearly explained. The Secretary noted that including the data of reclassified hospitals in "the MSA where the hospital is physically located .... improves consistency and predictability in hospital reclassification and wage indexes, as well as alleviates the fluctuations in the wage indexes due to reclassifications." 66 Fed. Reg. at 39865. Moreover, the Secretary explained that reclassified hospitals may continue to compete for labor with the other hospitals in their MSA, and that their higher wages could pressure neighboring hospitals to increase their wages accordingly. Id. at 39866. These considerations, in addition to the conclusion that the Secretary had the authority to make *30 this change through rulemaking, found support in the MedPAC Report which was cited and discussed in the proposed rule.
Plaintiffs repeatedly assert that only the Secretary's 2001 interpretation is reasonable, but they fail to point to anything about the agency's prior interpretation of the statutory scheme that was either unreasonable or arbitrary.[10] As noted above, the mere fact that the agency reevaluated the impact of its policy and changed its practice does not render the prior interpretation unreasonable. It is also significant thatdespite a number of congressional amendments to 42 U.S.C. § 1395ww(d) during the period that the agency enforced its policy of excluding reclassified hospitals from the calculation of the wage indexes of the urban areas in which those hospitals were physically located Congress never questioned or otherwise addressed the policy. See Chevron, 467 U.S. at 864, 104 S.Ct. 2778 (pointing out that Congress's failure to "indicate[] any disapproval of a flexible reading of the statute" supports the conclusion that "the definition itself is flexible"). Because the Court concludes that the Secretary's policy of excluding reclassified hospitals from plaintiffs' wage-index calculations constituted a permissible construction of the statute, the Secretary's interpretation is entitled to deference. Therefore, plaintiffs' challenge under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C) fails.

D. Additional Claims
Plaintiffs also contend that the Secretary's exclusion of reclassified hospitals from the wage index calculations in FY 2000 and 2001(1) violated 42 C.F.R. § 413.5(b)(3); (2) was arbitrary and capricious in violation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); and (3) violated plaintiffs' rights to equal protection.[11] These arguments are not well-developed in the parties' submissions and, as explained briefly below, are without merit.
Section 413.5(b)(3) of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations is a regulation which states "[i]n general terms" that one goal of reimbursement should be to create "a division of the allowable costs between the beneficiaries of [the Medicare] program and the other patients of the provider that ... is fair to each provider individually." Plaintiffs conclusorily state that the Secretary's challenged policy was unfair to the individual hospitals, but fail to explain how or why this particular regulation applies in the present case or how the regulation confers any enforceable legal rights upon plaintiffs. For these reasons, the Court rejects this claim.
Despite the distinct legal standards, plaintiffs make one combined argument that the Secretary's policy (1) was arbitrary and capricious and (2) violated their constitutional rights to equal protection. With respect to the claim based on 5 U.S.C. § 706(A)(2), plaintiffs argue that the Secretary failed to fulfill the statutory *31 purpose of § 1395ww(d)(3)(E)(i) and that the negative impact on plaintiff hospitals renders the Secretary's practice arbitrary and capricious. See Pls.' Mem. at 22-24. The D.C. Circuit has recognized that the arbitrary and capricious standard often "overlaps" with the second step of Chevron, because "whether a statute is unreasonably interpreted is close analytically to the issue whether an agency's actions under a statute are unreasonable." (Shays v. Fed. Election Comm'n, 414 F.3d 76, 96 (D.C.Cir.2005) (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted)). Here, plaintiffs' arguments under the arbitrary and capricious standard map directly onto the arguments that this Court has already addressed and rejected in discussing the Secretary's interpretation of 42 U.S.C. § 1395ww(d)(3)(E)(i). These arguments need not be revisited.
Finally, as the Secretary points out, an equal protection challenge to the Medicare regulations is appropriately evaluated under the rational-basis standard. See Clinton Mem. Hosp. v. Sullivan, 783 F.Supp. 1429, 1440 (D.D.C.1992) (applying a "deferential standard" to an equal protection challenge to a Medicare regulation, and explaining that "the challenged statute or regulation will be struck down only if it `manifests a patently arbitrary classification, utterly lacking in rational justification'" (quoting Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.S. 749, 768, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975))), aff'd sub nom. Clinton Mem. Hosp. v. Shalala, 10 F.3d 854, 860-61 (D.C.Cir.1993). Plaintiffs contend that there was no valid reason to treat urban and rural hospitals differently, or to reimburse similarly situated hospitals at different levels before and after FY 2002. They do not challenge, however, the Secretary's proffered justifications for distinguishing between urban and rural hospitals or for not applying the change in the calculation of the wage indexes retroactively. Indeed, plaintiffs do not address their equal protection claim at all in their reply brief. And because the Secretary's proffered reasons "sufficient to justify any disparate treatment," id., plaintiffs' constitutional claim must fail.

IV. CONCLUSION
Accordingly, for the reasons stated, the Court GRANTS defendant's motion for summary judgment and DENIES plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. An appropriate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.
NOTES
[1]  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d), Secretary Sebelius, in her official capacity as the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, is automatically substituted as the named defendant.
[2]  This case was filed as two separate actions: Civil Action No. 07-2036, which addresses claims relating to FY 2000, and Civil Action No. 07-1484, which addresses claims relating to FY 2001. On January 4, 2008, the Court granted the parties' joint motion to consolidate the cases, and nothing substantive has been filed in Civil Action No. 07-2036 since the filing of the Administrative Record in February 2008. Because Civil Action No. 07-1484 is the operative case, all citations to the record in this Memorandum Opinion reference that case unless otherwise noted.
[3]  The hospitals that tend to be most negatively impacted by these classifications are those that compete for the same labor pool with hospitals located in larger, urban areas with higher wage indexes. See Robert Wood Johnson, 297 F.3d at 276 (describing the "inequitable results" caused by this situation); Athens Cmty. Hosp., Inc. v. Shalala, 21 F.3d 1176, 1177 (D.C.Cir.1994) ("[A] hospital that is in a rural area but must compete for labor with hospitals in a nearby urban area may be insufficiently reimbursed for the cost of providing services.").
[4]  This is often referred to as a "hold harmless" provision, because it ensures that hospitals in rural areas are "held harmless" from the effects of a reclassification. See Def.'s S.J. Mem. at 7.
[5]  This is sometimes called the "rural floor."
[6]  Plaintiffs claim that recalculating the wage index with data from the reclassified hospitals "would result in an increase of [plaintiffs'] collective reimbursement of approximately $23,956,069" for FY 2001 and approximately $20,588,699 for FY 2000. Compl., Civil Action No. 07-1484, at 14; Compl., Civil Action No. 07-2036, at 14.
[7]  The parties' briefing on both the cross motions and the objections to the Report and Recommendation includes considerable argument relating to the propriety of plaintiffs' proposed order, which specifically directs the Secretary to recalculate the wage index in a particular way and orders the Secretary to reimburse plaintiffs using these new calculations. Notwithstanding this dispute, however, the parties agree that if plaintiffs were to prevail on the merits, the case would have to be remanded to the agency to recalculate the wage indexes. And because, as discussed below, the Court concludes that defendant is entitled to summary judgment, further consideration of plaintiffs' proposed order is unnecessary.
[8]  The parties here agree that there are no material facts in dispute. They vigorously dispute, of course, which side is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
[9]  The Anna Jacques decision is currently on appeal to the D.C. Circuit. See Case Nos. 08-5407 and 08-5529 (D.C.Cir.).
[10]  Plaintiffs focus on a few particular words in the 2001 Federal Register notice, claiming that the Secretary's choice of words either (1) proves that the Secretary knew its prior practice was unlawful, and/or (2) constitutes an admission under the Federal Rules of Evidence. Defendant's briefing persuasively demonstrates why these arguments are utterly lacking in merit, and the Court will not address plaintiffs' contentions any further.
[11]  Plaintiffs state that defendant's policy violates "the Equal Protection Clause," but never specify what constitutional provision this claim is based upon. The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not apply to the federal government. Therefore, any constitutional claim against defendant based on equal protection principles would be cognizable only under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

WALD, Circuit Judge:


1
Davis County Solid Waste Management and Energy Recovery Special Service District and Waste Energy Partners Limited Partnership (collectively "petitioners") challenge the final standards governing municipal solid waste ("MSW") combustion that were promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA" or "agency") on December 19, 1995.  See Standards of Performance for Municipal Waste Combustors and Emission Guidelines for Existing Sources, 60 Fed.Reg. 65,387 (1995) ("1995 Standards").  These standards, which implement sections 111 and 129 of the Clean Air Act ("CAA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 7411, 7429 (1994), include new source performance standards ("NSPS") and emissions guidelines for a variety of substances and mixtures.  The NSPS apply to new municipal waste combustor ("MWC") units, while the emission guidelines apply to existing MWC units.


2
According to petitioners, the 1995 standards exceed the EPA's statutory authority under the CAA because they are based on the aggregate MSW combustion capacity ("MSW capacity") of the plant at which a MWC unit is located, rather than on the MSW capacity of the MWC unit.  Petitioners also argue that as applied to them the 1995 standards are arbitrary and capricious and that the EPA failed to comply with the CAA's procedural requirements in issuing the standards.  Cement Kiln Recycling Coalition ("CKRC") argues that the EPA exceeded its statutory authority, acted arbitrarily and capriciously, and failed to comply with the CAA's procedural requirements in applying the standards to cement kilns.  Since we agree with petitioners that the 1995 standards violate the plain meaning of section 129 and therefore vacate the standards, we do not reach petitioners' additional challenges or those of CKRC.

I. BACKGROUND

3
MSW is the waste generated by household, commercial, institutional and industrial sources, such as appliances, newspapers, food wastes, boxes and office paper.  MSW is disposed of in landfills or by incineration, also referred to as combustion.  According to the EPA, approximately 16 percent of the MSW generated in the United States today is combusted.  1995 Standards, 60 Fed.Reg. at 65,390, 65,392.   Combustion of MSW results in the emission of various air pollutants, such as acid gases, organics, metals, nitrogen oxides and ash, some of which are considered to be carcinogens or to have other adverse effects when inhaled.  See Assessment of Municipal Waste Combustor Emissions Under the Clean Air Act, 52 Fed.Reg. 25,399, 25,403-06 (1987) ("1987 Assessment").  Prompted by growing awareness about the potential hazards of air emissions from MWC units, as well as a petition from several states and environmental groups, in 1987 the EPA issued an advance notice of its intention to regulate MWC units under section 111 of the CAA, which requires the EPA to propose emission standards for sources that the EPA determines "causes, or contributes significantly to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare."  42 U.S.C. § 7411(b)(1)(A);  1987 Assessment, 52 Fed.Reg. at 25,399 (1987).


4
The EPA issued the proposed standards for MWC emissions in 1989.  See Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources:  Municipal Waste Combustors, 54 Fed.Reg. 52,251 (1989) ("1989 Proposed NSPS");  Emission Guidelines:  Municipal Waste Combustors, 54 Fed.Reg. 52,209 (1989) ("1989 Proposed Guidelines").  The proposed standards did not require that any particular technology be installed in MWC units to control emissions;  rather, they established limits on the levels of certain pollutants that MWC units could emit, and derived these limits from studying the level of emissions achievable with the best pollution control technology.  In establishing these emission limits, the standards distinguished among MWC units based on whether the unit was built after or was already existing at the time the standards were proposed and on the aggregate MSW capacity of the plant at which a MWC unit was located.  MSW capacity was defined as the maximum amount of MSW that could be combusted daily at a unit, and aggregate MSW plant capacity was defined as the sum of the MSW capacities of all of the MWC units at the same location.  1989 Proposed NSPS, 54 Fed.Reg. at 52,255, 52,261-62;  1989 Proposed Guidelines, 54 Fed Reg. at 52,213, 51,219-20.


5
The proposed standards for new units located at plants with an aggregate capacity greater than 250 tons per day ("tons/day") ("large new units"), and existing units located at plants with an aggregate MSW capacity above 2,200 tons/day ("regional existing units"), were based on the emissions control achievable with the highest efficiency scrubber system, a spray dryer/fabric filter system ("SD/FF").  The standards for new units located at plants with an aggregate capacity of 250 tons/day or less ("small new units") and existing units located at plants with an aggregate MSW capacity above 250 tons a day and up to 2,200 tons/day ("large existing units"), were based on the emissions control achievable with an intermediate scrubber system, such as dry sorbent injection/fabric filter ("DSI/FF") system or a dry sorbent injection/electrostatic precipitator ("DSI/ EPS") system.1  The standards for existing units located at plants with an aggregate MSW capacity of 250 tons/day or less ("small existing units"), on the other hand, did not necessitate the use of any scrubber technology because the EPA decided that its cost for these small plants would be unreasonable.  Instead, the standards for small existing MWC units only required that these plants employ an ESP, the minimum control technology available to reduce emissions of particulate matter, and, like all MWC units, follow good combustion practices ("GCP") and meet certain material separation requirements.2  1989 Proposed NSPS, 54 Fed.Reg. at 52,254, 52,272;  1989 Proposed Guidelines, 54 Fed.Reg. at 52,012-52,228-30.


6
Congress responded to the EPA's 1989 proposed standards by enacting section 129, specifically addressed to solid waste incineration units, as part of Title III of the 1990 CAA amendments.  Section 129(a)(1) directs the EPA to establish emission standards for solid waste incineration units, including NSPS directly applicable to new units and emission guidelines applicable to existing units by way of state implementation plans.3  42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(1).  Congress defined a "solid waste incineration unit" as "a distinct operating unit of any facility which combusts any solid waste material from commercial or industrial establishments or the general public."  42 U.S.C. § 7429(g)(1).  Certain incinerators, such as units requiring permits under the Solid Waste Disposal Act or materials recovery facilities, were excluded from the definition of a solid waste incineration unit.  Id.  MSW was defined as "refuse ... collected from the general public and from residential, commercial, institutional and industrial sources" and units combusting a fuel stream that is comprised of 30 percent or less of MSW were excluded from the definition of MWC units and from the standards applicable to MWC units.4  Id. § 7429(g)(5).


7
Section 129(a)(2) lays out the methodology the EPA must use in setting the emissions standards, referred to as maximum achievable control technology ("MACT") standards, and requires that the standards "shall reflect the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of ... [certain listed air pollutants] that the [EPA], taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction, and any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements, determines is achievable for new or existing units in each category."  Id. § 129(a)(2).  The EPA "may distinguish among classes, types, ... and sizes of units within a category in establishing [MACT] standards," but the EPA's discretion to determine the stringency of MACT standards is limited;  the MACT standards must be at least as stringent as the MACT floor.  The MACT floor is defined as either "the emissions control ... achieved in practice by the best controlled similar unit" for "new units in a category," or as "the average emissions limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of units in the category" for existing units.  Id. This description of the MACT methodology demonstrates that the demarcation of the relevant categories of solid waste incineration units is central to the regulatory scheme established in section 129.  The importance of how a category of units is defined is clearest in regard to existing units, whose MACT floor is the lowest level of emissions achieved by the best controlled 12 percent of units in a category;  the MACT floor will obviously be lower if the category includes more units with advanced pollution control devices than if the category contains fewer units with such devices.  But how the categories are defined proves important also with respect to new units, since the standards for a new unit in a given category will be based on the best performing similar unit, which will be another unit in that category.


8
Section 129 also identified the pollutants for which the EPA must issue emissions standards and set deadlines by which the standards must be issued.  Section 129(a)(4) required that the EPA "specify numerical emission limitations" for certain substances and mixtures, some of which (cadmium, lead, mercury and fly/bottom ash) were not covered by the proposed 1989 standards.  Id. § 7429(a)(4).  The schedule set out in section 129(a)(1) is as follows:  standards for MWC units with a MSW capacity above 250 tons/day were to be promulgated by November 15, 1991;  standards for MWC units with a MSW capacity of 250 tons/day or less and for units combusting hospital, medical or infectious waste were to be promulgated by November 15, 1992;  and standards for units combusting commercial and industrial waste were to be proposed by November 15, 1993 and promulgated by November 15, 1994.  Id. § 7429(a)(1).  The EPA was also required to publish a schedule by May 15, 1992, indicating when standards for other categories of solid waste incineration units would be promulgated.


9
At the time of the 1990 CAA amendments, the EPA was under a court deadline to promulgate final standards for new and existing MWC units.  Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources:  Municipal Waste Combustors, 56 Fed.Reg. 5488, 5488 (1991) ("1991 NSPS");  Emissions Guidelines:  Municipal Waste Combustors, 56 Fed.Reg. 5514, 5514 (1991) ("1991 Guidelines").  In setting a deadline for the promulgation of standards for MWC units with a capacity greater than 250 tons/day, Congress stated that it did not intend to disturb any court ordered schedule, and that standards issued pursuant to such a schedule should be subsequently modified, if necessary, to conform to section 129.  Id.  The EPA therefore only issued final standards applicable to new and existing units with unit MSW capacities greater than 250 tons/day.  The final standards, issued in 1991, differed somewhat from those proposed in 1989.  The standards for new units were based on the emissions control obtainable not only with a SD/FF system, as proposed, but also with selective noncatalytic reduction ("SNCR").5  In promulgating the final 1991 standards for existing units, the EPA changed the categorization of units it had proposed in 1989, eliminating the "regional unit" category and instead distinguishing between "very large units," which were units located at plants with aggregate MSW capacities above 1,100 tons/day, and "large units," which were units located at plants with aggregate MSW capacities above 250 tons/day up to and including 1,100 tons/day.  The standards for very large units were based on the emissions control obtainable with a SD/ESP system, whereas the standards for large units were based on the control obtainable with a DSI/ESP system.  The 1991 standards dropped the materials separation requirement proposed in 1989 because of cost concerns, but the GCP requirement for all units remained.  1991 NSPS, 56 Fed.Reg. at 5490;  1991 guidelines, 56 Fed.Reg. at 5516-17.


10
The EPA proposed new standards for MWC units, based on section 129 and the MACT methodology, on September 20, 1994.  See Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources:  Municipal Waste Combustors, 59 Fed.Reg. 48,198 (1994) ("1994 Proposed NSPS");  Emissions Guidelines:  Municipal Waste Combustors, 59 Fed.Reg. 48,228 (1994) ("1994 Proposed Guidelines").  The 1994 proposed standards imposed more stringent emissions limits than the 1991 standards and covered more MWC units.6  1994 Proposed NSPS, 59 Fed.Reg. at 48,200-02, 48,205; 1994 Proposed Guidelines, 59 Fed.Reg. at 48,230-32.   As required by the MACT methodology, the EPA first calculated MACT floors based on the emissions control achieved by the best controlled similar unit for new units, or the emissions control achieved by the best performing 12 percent of units in the same category for existing units.  In determining which units were similar or in the same category for the purposes of setting MACT floors, the 1994 proposed standards differentiated among both new and existing units based on the aggregate MSW capacity of the plant at which the MWC unit was located rather than on the capacity of the individual MWC unit.  Like the earlier standards, the 1994 proposed standards defined aggregate MSW plant capacity as the sum of the maximum amount of MSW each MWC unit located at a particular site is designed to combust daily.  MWC units were then grouped for MACT standard-setting purposes into those with an aggregate MSW capacity greater than 250 tons/day ("large plants") and those with an aggregate MSW capacity greater than 35 megagrams per day ("Mg/day") up to and including 250 tons/day ("small plants").7  1994 Proposed NSPS, 59 Fed.Reg. at 48,198, 48,202, 48,212-13;  1994 Proposed Guidelines, 59 Fed.Reg. at 48,231-32, 48,244.


11
The EPA kept the MACT standards for several pollutants at the MACT floors for both new and existing units, because it concluded that going beyond the MACT floor would impose significant retrofitting costs that were unreasonable given the limited additional pollution control that stricter standards would achieve.  The MACT floors for new units at large plants were based on a SD/FF system with SNCR and activated carbon injection ("CI"), while the MACT floors for existing units at large plants were based on a SD/FF or SD/ESP system with SNCR and carbon injection.8  The MACT floors for new units at small plants, on the other hand, were based on a SD/FF system with CI and the MACT floors for existing units at small plants were based on only a DSI/ESP system and carbon injection.  1994 NSPS, 59 Fed.Reg. at 48,213-16;  1994 Proposed Guidelines, 59 Fed.Reg. at 48,232-33, 48,245-49.   Units located at plants with a MSW capacity between 25 Mg/day and 35 Mg/day were required to submit initial reports but were not subject to emission controls.  1994 NSPS, 59 Fed.Reg. at 48,212-16;  1994 Proposed Guidelines, 59 Fed.Reg. at 48,242-49.   All units subject to the standards were required to comply with the GCP specified in the 1991 standards, with new training and MWC operator requirements;  additional siting and material separation plan requirements were imposed on new units.  1994 Proposed NSPS, 59 Fed.Reg. at 48,206, 48,219-22;  1994 Proposed Guidelines, 59 Fed.Reg. at 48,232, 48,235.


12
On December 19, 1995, the EPA promulgated the 1994 proposed standards in final form, with a few modifications.  1995 Standards, 60 Fed.Reg. 65,387.   The major changes were the following:  new and existing MWC units located at plants with aggregate MSW capacities greater than 35 Mg/day, but actually combusting less than 10 Mg/day of MSW and limited to this lower level by permit, were exempt from the standards and were only required to file an initial report on their operations;  new and existing MWC units with a total capacity of 25 to 35 mg/day were exempted from initial notification requirements;  and the MACT floor for nitrogen oxides for both new and existing units was determined separately for each type of combustor.  1995 Standards, 60 Fed.Reg. at 65,401-44.   Notably, the 1995 final standards retained the proposed approach of creating categories of MWC units based on the aggregate MSW capacity of the plants at which the units are located.  The final standards also retained the proposed definition of a MWC as "any setting or equipment that combusts MSW," and further continued to exclude cofired combustors, which burn MSW along with non-MSW materials, from the scope of the standards, provided only 30 percent or less of the combustor's fuel stream was MSW.  Id. at 65,391-95, 65,398-99.


13
Petitioners operate existing MWC units that have unit MSW capacities below 250 tons/day, but are located at plants with an aggregate MSW capacity above 250 tons/day.  Including petitioners' units, there are 45 units located at 18 plants in this status.  Because the 1995 standards categorize units by aggregate plant MSW capacity for purposes of determining the MACT floor, these units are currently grouped with large existing units.  Since large existing units generally have the most efficient pollution control systems of any existing units, the MACT floor derived from the emissions of large existing units is very stringent.  Petitioners argue that if MWC units were instead categorized by unit MSW capacity for the purpose of determining MACT floor, their units would be subject to less stringent emissions levels, because they would be grouped with smaller units that have less efficient pollution control systems and thus higher MACT floors.9  Petitioners' MWC units are currently equipped with DSI/ESP systems, and in order to meet the 1995 standards the units would have to be retrofit with SD, CI and possibly SNCR devices, at a substantial cost.


14
After the 1995 standards were issued, petitioners and CKRC filed the challenges at issue here.  This court subsequently denied the EPA's request for a voluntary remand to supplement the record and stayed the 1995 standards pending the outcome of this appeal.

II. DISCUSSION

15
Petitioners' main challenge is that the use of aggregate plant capacity to set the categories of MWC units for purposes of determining MACT floors and standards is inconsistent with section 129 of the CAA, which they claim requires categories of MWC units for MACT purposes to be based on unit MSW capacity.  We must vacate the 1995 standards if they are "in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right."  42 U.S.C. § 7607(d)(9)(C);  see also 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C);  American Petroleum Inst. v. EPA, 52 F.3d 1113, 1119 (D.C.Cir.1995) (same standard applies under CAA and APA review provisions).  As the EPA is entrusted with the responsibility of administering the CAA, the Chevron two-step analysis governs our inquiry into whether the agency's 1995 standards represent a permissible construction of section 129.  If we determine that "Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue, that is the end of the matter;  for the court ... must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress";  but "if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute."  Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781-82, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).  In this case, our analysis need not proceed beyond Chevron's first step, for it is clear that the 1995 standards conflict with the plain meaning of section 129.

A. The Language of Section 129

16
The precise question here is whether section 129 establishes different categories of MWC units based on unit MSW capacity for the purpose of determining MACT floors and standards.  The language of section 129(a)(1) is critical to our analysis, and we set it out in full:


17
(a) New source performance standards10


18
(1) In general


19
(A) The Administrator shall establish performance standards and other requirements pursuant to section 7411 of this title and this section for each category of solid waste incineration units.  Such standards shall include emissions limitations and other requirements applicable to new units and guidelines (under 7411(d) of this title and this section) and other requirements applicable to existing units.

(B) Standards under section 7411 of this title and this section applicable to solid waste incineration units with capacity greater than 250 tons per day combusting municipal waste shall be promulgated not later than 12 months after November 15, 1990.  Nothing in this subparagraph shall alter any schedule for the promulgation of standards applicable to such units under section 7411 of this title pursuant to any settlement and consent decree entered by the Administrator before November 15, 1990:  Provided, That, such standards are subsequently modified pursuant to the schedule established in this subparagraph to include each of the requirements in this section.


21
(C) Standards under section 7411 of this title and this section applicable to solid waste incineration units with capacity equal to or less than 250 tons per day combusting municipal waste and units combusting hospital waste, medical waste and infectious waste shall be promulgated not later than 24 months after November 15, 1990.


22
(D) Standards under section 7411 of this title and this section applicable to solid waste incineration units combusting commercial or industrial waste shall be proposed not later than 36 months after November 15, 1990, and promulgated not later than 48 months after November 15, 1990.


23
(E) Not later than 18 months after November 15, 1990, the Administrator shall publish a schedule for the promulgation of standards under section 7411 and this section applicable to other categories of solid waste incineration units.


24
It is indisputable that section 129(a)(1) expressly differentiates among units based on unit MSW capacity when it states that standards for "units with [a MSW] capacity greater than 250 [tons/day]" must be issued by November 15, 1991, while standards for "units with [a MSW] capacity equal to or less than 250 tons/day" need not be issued until November 15, 1992.  The only question remaining is whether in this provision Congress intended to create two categories of MWC units based on unit capacity for the purpose of determining what emissions controls will be imposed on the units, or whether it intended only to differentiate between the two types of MWC units for regulatory scheduling purposes.  The EPA maintains that section 129(a)(1) simply sets out the deadlines by which emissions standards must be promulgated and does not create two categories of MWC units for substantive regulatory purposes.  Petitioners unsurprisingly contend the opposite, that section 129(a)(1) plainly establishes two separate categories of solid waste incineration units, large MWC units (units with unit MSW capacities above 250 tons/day) and small MWC units (units with unit MSW capacities of 250 tons/day or less), for which emissions controls must be separately promulgated.


25
The text and structure of section 129(a)(1) and the rest of section 129 go to show that petitioners have much the better of the argument.  Section 129(a)(1) begins by stating that the EPA shall promulgate standards and guidelines for "each category of solid waste incineration units," and then proceeds to identify specific types of units and the date by which standards shall be issued for each type.  The types of units identified are not only MWC units with a unit capacity above 250 tons/day and MWC units with a unit capacity of 250 tons/day or less, but also units combusting hospital and medical waste and units combusting commercial or industrial waste.  The plain implication of section 129(a)(1) is that the types of units listed are the relevant categories for determining emissions standards.  This implication is reinforced by the final part of section 129(a)(1), section 129(a)(1)(E), which states that the EPA shall publish a schedule indicating when standards applicable to "other categories of solid waste incineration units" will be promulgated.  The reference to the EPA's authority to identify and set promulgation deadlines for other categories of solid waste incineration units plainly implies that certain categories of these units have already been identified.  This interpretation is bolstered by the fact that at no other point in section 129 are any categories of solid waste incineration units identified in prior parts of the section.  Instead, the language used in the following parts of section 129 assumes that the basic categories of solid waste incineration units have already been set and proceeds to give guidance on how the EPA should treat different units within the categories in determining emission standards, emphasizing in particular that the EPA is to distinguish between new and existing units within a category.  For example, section 129(a)(2) instructs the EPA to require the maximum degree of emissions control that the EPA determines "is achievable for new or existing units in each category," specifies that the EPA is to follow a different methodology in calculating MACT floor for new and existing units and authorizes the EPA to set "[e]missions standards for existing units in a category [that are] ... less stringent than standards for new units in the same category," provided the standards for existing units are at least as stringent as the MACT floor.


26
Significantly, the EPA does not dispute that section 129(a)(1) sets out the basic categories of solid waste incineration units.  According to the EPA, however, section 129(a)(1) should be read as differentiating among units on the basis of the type of waste being combusted, and thus the categories of units created in section 129(a)(1) are units combusting MSW (MWC units), units combusting medical, hospital and infectious waste, and units combusting commercial and industrial waste.  The EPA maintains that reading the regulatory deadlines in section 129(a)(1) as establishing the different categories of solid waste incineration units would actually run counter to the legislative mandate, because this approach would preclude differentiation among units by the type of waste combusted.  According to the EPA's view of petitioners' statutory argument, small MWC units and units combusting hospital waste, medical waste, and infectious waste would have to be considered as one category because these units are both listed in the same clause of section 129(a)(1) and assigned the same promulgation deadline.  We have difficulty in following the EPA's logic.  Section 129(a)(1) creates two categories of MWC units not simply because it imposes different dates by which the standards for large and small MWC units must be promulgated, but more compellingly because it separately defines these two types of MWC units.  Since section 129(a)(1) also separately identifies units combusting hospital, medical, and infectious waste and units combusting commercial and industrial waste, these represent two additional categories of solid waste incineration units.  Thus, the most logical and straightforward reading of section 129(a)(1) is that it establishes four categories of solid waste incineration units--MWC units with a unit capacity above 250 tons/day, MWC units with a unit capacity of 250 tons/day or less, units combusting hospital, medical and infectious waste, and units combusting commercial or industrial waste.


27
The EPA's claim that section 129(a)(1) is simply a scheduling provision is also implausible in light of the regulatory scheme detailed in the following subsection of the statute, section 129(a)(2).  See Ethyl Corp. v. EPA, 51 F.3d 1053, 1061 (D.C.Cir.1995) (drawing on a neighboring CAA provision in determining that the EPA's interpretation of its authority to issue waivers for fuel additives violated the plain meaning of section 211(f)(4) of the CAA).  Under the MACT methodology set out in section 129(a)(2), the emission standards must be at least as stringent as the MACT floors, and MACT floor for existing units is defined as the average level of emissions achieved by the best performing 12 percent of units in a category.  Therefore, in order to promulgate emissions standards, the EPA must first calculate MACT floors, and the EPA cannot calculate the MACT floors until it has studied the emissions levels of all the units in the relevant category.  When this MACT methodology set out in section 129(a)(2) is viewed in light of the regulatory deadlines established in section 129(a)(1), it becomes apparent that Congress must have intended large and small MWC units to represent separate categories of solid waste incineration units.  If large MWC units are a separate category of units, the EPA can set emissions standards for these units before it gathers data on emissions at small MWC units;  but if large and small MWC units are in the same category, the EPA cannot set standards for large MWC units until it has studied emissions at small MWC units, because the EPA would need this emissions data to calculate MACT floors.


28
That the EPA was able to avoid this dilemma in practice only by simultaneously studying emissions at all MWC units and then simultaneously promulgating new standards for large and small MWC units in 1994 does not detract from the plain import of the section's language and structure, which assumes differently timed regulatory actions.  While section 129 certainly does not preclude the EPA from simultaneously studying and promulgating standards for large and small MWC units, nothing in section 129 either requires or even suggests such simultaneous action.  Rather, it is clear from the text of section 129(a)(1), setting out different deadlines for when standards for large and small MWC units are to be promulgated, that Congress anticipated separate promulgation.  The EPA's approach essentially reads these different deadlines out of the statute, and it is of course a well-established maxim of statutory construction that courts should avoid interpretations that render a statutory provision superfluous.  Pennsylvania Dep't of Pub. Welfare v. Davenport, 495 U.S. 552, 562, 110 S.Ct. 2126, 2132, 109 L.Ed.2d 588 (1990);  Alabama Power Co. v. EPA, 40 F.3d 450, 455 (D.C.Cir.1994).  In the final analysis the only interpretation of section 129's language that both gives meaning to the regulatory deadlines in section 129(a)(1) and coheres with the MACT methodology set out in section 129(a)(2) is one that reads section 129(a)(1) as creating two categories of MWC units for regulatory purposes, namely large and small MWC units.


29
The EPA points to section 129(a)(2), which states that the EPA "may distinguish among classes, types ... and sizes of units within a category in establishing [MACT] standards" as evidence that section 129 authorizes the EPA to group MWC units by aggregate plant capacity for MACT purposes.  42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(2).  According to the EPA, it has merely exercised its discretion under section 129(a)(2) and differentiated among three classes of MWC units:  those located at plants with an aggregate MSW capacity above 250 tons/day, those located at plants with an aggregate MSW capacity of 250 tons/day or less, and those located at plants with an aggregate MSW capacity of 35 Mg/day or less.  But this justification for the aggregate plant capacity approach of the 1995 standards assumes that Congress put all MWC units in one category in section 129(a)(1), since section 129(a)(2) only gives the EPA discretion to distinguish among units within a category.   As discussed above, however, this assumption is indefensible in light of the distinction in section 129(a)(1) between MWC units with unit capacities above 250 tons/day and MWC units with unit capacities of 250 tons/day or less.


30
Given that section 129(a)(1) created these two categories of MWC units, section 129(a)(2) actually serves as further evidence that the aggregate plant capacity approach used in the 1995 standards violates the plain meaning of section 129.  In section 129 Congress notably did not give the EPA much discretion to create categories of solid waste incineration units;  rather, it listed several categories of solid waste incineration units and only allowed the EPA discretion to identify "other categories of solid waste incineration units."   In contrast, section 111 of the CAA, which applies to all stationary sources of air pollutants, and section 112, which applies to all stationary sources of hazardous air pollutants, give the EPA substantial discretion to create categories of sources for which standards must be promulgated.  42 U.S.C. § 7411(b)(1)(A);  42 U.S.C. §§ 7412(c)(1), 7412(c)(3).  Neither the provision of discretionary authority to distinguish "within a category" in section 129(a)(2), nor the grant of authority to identify categories of air pollution sources in section 111, can, however, be used so as to eradicate the very specific limits placed on the EPA's authority to create categories of solid waste incineration units laid out in section 129(a)(1).11  See, e.g., Mead Corp. v. Browner, 100 F.3d 152, 155-56 (D.C.Cir.1996) (EPA's general power to group hazardous waste sites for response purposes under CERCLA does not authorize the EPA to include a site on national site list that does not meet statutory listing criteria simply by grouping it with sites that do meet criteria);   American Petroleum Institute, 52 F.3d at 1119 ("EPA cannot rely on its general authority to make rules necessary to carry out its functions when a specific statutory directive defines the relevant functions of EPA in a particular area").  Sections 111 and 112 act as counterindicators to the EPA's interpretation, since they illustrate that Congress knew how to bestow such category-defining discretion when it wanted to do so.

B. The Legislative History of Section 129

31
The EPA also defends its aggregate plant capacity approach by citing to the legislative history of section 129, which it says demonstrates that Congress intended to allow the EPA to establish its own categories of units, including categories based on aggregate plant capacity, in order to realize the congressional purpose behind section 129.  Even though we find the meaning of section 129(a)(1) clear from its text, we will examine the legislative history of section 129 to determine whether reading section 129 according to its literal meaning will frustrate congressional intent.  Ordinarily, "[t]he plain meaning of legislation should be conclusive, except in the 'rare cases [in which] the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters.' "   United States v. Ron Pair Enters., Inc., 489 U.S. 235, 242, 109 S.Ct. 1026, 1030, 103 L.Ed.2d 290 (1989) (quoting Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc., 458 U.S. 564, 571, 102 S.Ct. 3245, 3250, 73 L.Ed.2d 973 (1982)) (alterations in original);  see also Environmental Defense Fund v. EPA, 82 F.3d 451, 468-69, as amended, 92 F.3d 1209 (D.C.Cir.1996).  "[L]iteral interpretation need not rise to the level of 'absurdity' before recourse is taken to the legislative history, ... [but] there must be evidence that Congress meant something other than what it literally said before a court can depart from plain meaning."  Engine Mfrs. Ass'n v. EPA, 88 F.3d 1075, 1088 (D.C.Cir.1996) (citation omitted).  An examination of the legislative history here fails to provide the requisite evidence that reading section 129 as creating two categories of MWC units based on unit capacity would frustrate legislative purpose or otherwise violate the intent of its drafters;  indeed, we believe it demonstrates the opposite.


32
The language and structure of section 129 changed dramatically as the 1990 CAA amendments wound their way through Congress.  The House did not include any provision on solid waste incineration in the bill it initially passed and sent to conference, and there was no informative discussion of section 129, after it appeared in the conference bill.  See 136 CONG. REC.  11,904 (daily ed. May 23, 1990) (Statement of Rep.  Bliley), reprinted in 2 COMM. ON ENV'T  & PUB. WORKS, 103D CONG., A LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF THE CLEAN AIR ACT AMENDMENTS 2724 (1993) ("LEGISLATIVE HISTORY"').  Consequently, the only relevant history of section 129 comes from the Senate's deliberations.  A provision on municipal combustion was contained in the reported version of Senate Bill 1630, the legislation embodying the CAA amendments.  This early version of section 129 (which at this point was actually section 130) differed dramatically from the finally enacted section 129;  for example, it addressed only municipal waste combustion, required that the EPA use the best available control technology approach then in use in section 211 of the CAA in promulgating standards, did not differentiate between new and existing units in specifying how standards would be calculated or provide for the EPA to take costs into account in setting emission controls.  S. 1630, 101st Cong., § 130 (as reported), reprinted in 5 LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, at 8154-80.  An amendment offered by Senator Dole on the floor after the bill was reported out of committee, which was also supported by the bill's managers and sponsors, embodied much of the language of the present section 129(a)(1), including the separate promulgation deadlines for MWC units with unit capacities above 250 tons/day and MWC units with unit capacities of 250 tons/day or less.  136 CONG. REC.  6549 (daily ed. Apr. 3, 1990), reprinted in 4 LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, at 7250.  Although the Senate amendment required the EPA to distinguish among classes, sizes and types of units within a category, this mandatory language was changed in conference to permit rather than require the EPA to do so.  In addition, section 129(a)(2) was changed in conference to incorporate the MACT methodology, which was also applied to section 112 of the CAA, replacing the best achievable control technology approach and the caveat was added that section 129's deadlines were not to displace any court-ordered schedule.   H.R. CONF. REP.   No. 952, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. at 187-88 (1990), reprinted in 1 LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, at 1637-38.


33
From our reading, we can discern no clear congressional understanding as to what categories of solid waste incineration units were created by section 129.  Senator Dole did not specifically discuss how the different categories of solid waste incineration units would be identified when he offered his amendment.  However, he did state that he offered the amendment so that standards applicable to "large municipal incinerators" would not be imposed on all incinerators and described the difficulties these standards would pose for hospital and medical waste incinerators, "smaller modular incineration systems widely used ... for dealing with municipal waste for rural areas and small communities," and for "[i]ndustrial incinerators."   136 CONG. REC.  6400 (daily ed.  Apr. 3, 1990), reprinted in 4 LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, at 7049-50.  His comments, if anything, point in the direction that section 129(a)(1) was intended to create four categories of units--large MWC units, small MWC units, hospital and medical units and industrial units--as indeed the plain language of section 129(a)(1) suggests.  On the other hand, post-conference statements on the Senate floor by a sponsor and a manager of the bill, Senators Durenberger and Chafee, respectively, indicate that they thought units would be divided into categories according to the type of waste combusted and that all MWC units would be in one category.  Senator Durenberger stated that section 129 "requires EPA to issue new source performance standards for municipal incinerators, for medical waste incinerators and for incinerators burning commercial and industrial waste," while Senator Chafee commented that "[t]he conference agreement includes provision to control the air emissions from municipal, hospital and other commercial and industrial incinerators."   136 CONG. REC.  6401 (daily ed. Apr. 3, 1990) (Statement of Sen.  Durenberger), reprinted in 4 LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, at 7052;  136 CONG. REC.  S16,955 (daily ed. Oct. 27, 1990) (Statement of Sen.  Chafee), reprinted in 1 LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, at 952.  Meanwhile, remarks by Senator Baucus, the other Senate manager, stating that "the Administrator[,] in establishing MACT for incinerators is directed to establish different categories for units combusting municipal waste with capacity greater than 250 tons per day, units with capacity less than 250 tons per day combusting municipal waste and medical waste, and for units combusting commercial or industrial waste," suggest that he believed not only that there would be two categories of MWC units, based on unit capacity, but also that smaller MWC units and units combusting medical waste would be in the same category.  136 CONG. REC.  S16,979 (daily ed. Oct. 27, 1990), reprinted in 1 LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, at 1031;  see also 136 CONG. REC.  6402 (daily ed. Apr. 3, 1990) (Statement of Sen.  Baucus) (amendment embodying section 129 "directs EPA to establish one set of standards for municipal incinerators, another set for hospital incinerators and small units, and another set for industrial incinerators."), reprinted in 4 LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, at 7054.  The inconsistencies in the comments of different Senators is not surprising;  the provisions of section 129 are highly technical, and the impact of the different descriptions of section 129(a)(1)'s categories would have been difficult to foresee.  Inevitably, such a plethora of inconsistent statements provides too "meager [a] record" for us to conclude that Congress intended to create a single category of MWC units, particularly "given the clear statutory language" to the contrary.  Engine Mfrs. Ass'n, 88 F.3d at 1091;  see also Qi-Zhuo v. Meissner, 70 F.3d 136, 140 (D.C.Cir.1995) ("in the realm of legislative interpretation, inconsistent history certainly cannot override plain language").


34
The legislative history does demonstrate that in enacting section 129 Congress sought to force the EPA to impose stricter emission standards on MWC.  The 1989 proposed regulations formed the backdrop to Congress' passage of section 129, and it is evident that Congress believed the 1989 proposed standards did not impose adequate emissions control, especially in regard to the smaller existing units that were exempted from having to install any scrubber devices.  The legislation embodying the 1990 CAA amendments specifically directed the EPA to reconsider its proposed 1989 emissions standards for "small new units and for existing units" in light of the new MACT methodology.  42 U.S.C. § 7429, Note (Review of Acid Gas Scrubbing Requirements);  see also H.R. CONF. REP.   No. 101-952, at 342 ("Proposed requirements for units smaller than 250 tons per day should be reconsidered in light of the new provisions of section 129."), reprinted in 1 LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, at 1792.  In the Senate debates, Senator Durenberger commented that although the EPA's approach at that juncture was a "credible effort," the EPA's standards were "not as protective as the standards ... sought in legislation," and that section 129 would require significantly more units to install scrubbers than the 1989 proposed standards.  136 CONG. REC.  S16,924 (daily ed. Oct. 27, 1990), reprinted in 1 LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, at 857-58.  Senator Baucus agreed, stating that "EPA is to review its proposal with respect to the acid gas scrubber requirement for all existing units....  EPA proposed a scrubber requirement for some very large existing units and no requirement for smaller units.  Whether that determination properly implements this new standard is in doubt."   136 CONG. REC.  S17,241 (daily ed. Oct. 26, 1990), reprinted in 1 LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, at 1137;  see also 136 CONG. REC.  6403 (daily ed. Apr. 3, 1990) (Statement of Sen.  Baucus) ("EPA's proposal is not adequate [in part because] ... it is limited to large municipal incinerators"), reprinted in 4 LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, at 7056.


35
Reading section 129 as categorizing MWC units based on unit capacity instead of aggregate plant capacity will not frustrate Congress' purpose of forcing the EPA to impose more stringent emissions controls on existing units.  Even if MWC units are categorized based on unit capacity, the standards for existing MWC units will still be more stringent than those proposed in 1989 because of the MACT methodology, and all MWC units with a capacity above 35 Mg/day will have to install some form of scrubber equipment.  More importantly, as the EPA itself admits, the effect of recalculating MACT floors based on unit capacity instead of aggregate plant capacity will be to make the standards applicable to small existing units significantly more stringent than in the 1995 standards.  Most small existing units that have unit MSW capacities lower than 250 tons/day are currently grouped in the small plant category;  the only exceptions are the 45 units (including petitioners' units) that have unit MSW capacities below 250 tons/day but are located at plants with aggregate plant capacities above 250 tons/day.  The effect of recalculating MACT floors based on unit capacity will be to replace this small plant category with a new "small unit" category that contains not only the units that were previously in the small plant category, but also these additional 45 MWC units.  Many, if not most, of these 45 MWC units have more effective pollution control systems than the existing units that were in the small plant category.  Since MACT floors are calculated by determining the level of emissions achieved by the best performing 12 percent of units in a category, grouping these 45 MWC units with the units that were in the small plant category will result in new MACT floors that are more stringent than the MACT floors that were calculated for the small plant category in 1995.  The actual emissions standards will similarly be more stringent, because, as discussed above, section 129 requires that the actual standards must be at least as stringent as the MACT floors.  The only way that this result can be avoided is if the EPA exercises its discretion to distinguish among units within a category and creates subcategories of small units, for which it can then calculate MACT floors and standards separately.


36
It is true that categorizing on the basis of unit capacity may make the standards applicable to petitioners' units and other similarly situated units less stringent.  While these units have more effective pollution control equipment than most units currently in the small plant category, they also have less effective equipment than most units currently in the large plant category.  Consequently, petitioners' units and other similarly situated units will encounter less stringent MACT floors, and most likely less stringent actual emission standards, when grouped with small units than they would when grouped with large units, even accounting for the increased stringency that will result from including these units in the new small unit category.12  But it is not at all apparent that this potential loss in emissions control goes against Congress' intent in enacting section 129.  At the same time as it sought greater emissions control, Congress clearly did not intend that all units should be required to adhere to emissions controls of the same stringency.  This intention was evident to some degree in the reported version of Senate Bill 1630, which authorized the EPA to distinguish among units based on the type of combustion technology or pollution control equipment the units employed.  It became much more apparent once Senate Bill 1630 was amended to require the EPA to differentiate among categories of solid waste incineration units and between new and existing units, to consider costs, non-air quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements in determining whether to set emissions standards that are more stringent than the MACT floor, and to allow the EPA to distinguish among classes, types and sizes of units in setting standards.  According to Senator Dole, the purpose of the new language was to insure that "real and important differences in size, class and type of technology ... are recognized," so that the use of incineration as a waste disposal method did not become economically infeasible.  136 CONG. REC.  6400 (daily ed. Apr. 3, 1990), reprinted in 4 LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, at 7049;  see also 136 CONG. REC.  S17,238-39 (daily ed. Oct. 26, 1990) (Statement of Sen.  Dole) (discussing provisions of S. 1630 after conference), reprinted in 1 LEGISLATIVE HISTORY at 1129-31.  Other Senators critically involved in the 1990 CAA amendments agreed, arguing that the new language would give the EPA greater flexibility to take important distinctions among units into account.  136 CONG. REC.  6402 (daily ed. Apr. 3, 1990) (Statement of Sen.  Baucus), reprinted in 4 LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, at 7054;  136 CONG. REC.  S17,238-39 (daily ed. Oct. 26, 1990) (Statement of Sen.  Durenberger) (responding to Sen.  Dole's comments on S. 1630 after conference), reprinted in 1 LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, at 1129-31.


37
Section 129 thus represents a compromise between competing concerns and purposes;  Congress wanted both to impose more stringent emission controls on incinerators and not to foreclose the use of incineration by imposing such stringent standards that smaller units could not feasibly meet them.  In a context of competing legislative purposes, it is often difficult to determine whether an interpretation of a statute frustrates or advances congressional purposes;  since if a "provision strikes a balance between competing policies, ... any adjustment of the balance to favor one policy would inevitably 'frustrate' another."  Engine Mfrs. Ass'n, 88 F.3d at 1089 n. 42;  see also Natural Resources Defense Council v. EPA, 822 F.2d 104, 113 (D.C.Cir.1987) ("[w]hile a broad policy goal may well be the animating force driving the legislation, achievement of actual passage of the measure invariably requires compromise and accommodation.").  Given Congress' emphasis on "real differences," such as size, among solid waste incineration units, and the fact that recategorizing units based on unit capacity may result in stricter emissions controls for some units, we are unable to conclude that any potential loss in emissions control at petitioners' and other similarly situated units would so frustrate the legislative purpose behind section 129 as to allow us to ignore the provision's plain language.


38
The EPA additionally argues that the legislative history of section 129 demonstrates that Congress meant unit capacity to refer to aggregate plant capacity, and thus, "as a matter of historical fact, Congress did not mean what it appears to have said."  Engine Mfrs. Ass'n, 88 F.3d at 1089.   The EPA bases this argument on the frequent remarks by members of Congress indicating that they believed they were "build[ing] upon the EPA proposal" in enacting section 129.  136 CONG. REC.  S16,924 (daily ed. Oct. 27, 1990) (Statement of Sen.  Durenberger), reprinted in 1 LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, at 857;  136 CONG. REC.  6403 (daily ed. Apr. 3, 1990) (Statement of Sen.  Baucus), reprinted in 4 LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, at 7056;  136 CONG. REC.  H12,863 (daily ed. Oct. 26, 1990) (Statement of Rep.  Bliley), reprinted in 1 LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, at 1225.  According to the EPA, this suggests that Congress did not perceive the categorization scheme set out in section 129 as different from that in the 1989 proposed standards, which distinguished among units based on aggregate plant capacity, not unit capacity.  The EPA also notes that the conference report and comments by the Senate managers and sponsors frequently refer to the standards for "small units" contained in the 1989 proposed standards, but in fact the regulations did not propose standards for "small units" but for MWC units located at "small MWC plants."   See, e.g., H.R. CONF. REP.   No. 101-952, at 342 (stating that "[p]roposed requirements for units smaller than 250 tons per day should be reconsidered," rather than that proposed requirements for units located at plants smaller than 250 tons/day should be reconsidered), reprinted in 1 LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, at 1792;  136 CONG. REC.  S17,241 (daily ed. Oct. 26, 1990) (Statement of Sen.  Baucus) (stating that "EPA proposed a scrubber requirement for some very large existing units and no requirement for smaller units," although the EPA actually had proposed scrubber requirements for units at large plants and exempted units at small plants), reprinted in 1 LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, at 1137;  136 CONG. REC.  S16,924 (daily ed. Oct. 27, 1990) (Statement of Sen.  Durenberger) (noting that Senate was delaying the promulgation date of standards "for the small units" so that the EPA could determine whether these units should remain exempt from scrubber requirements, even though the EPA had only exempted units at small plants from scrubber requirements);  reprinted in 1 LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, at 858.


39
All well and good, but an examination of the definition of "solid waste incineration unit" contained in section 129 itself reveals that Congress unequivocally defined a solid waste incineration unit as "a distinct operating unit of any facility" that combusts solid waste.  42 U.S.C. § 7429(g)(1).  In the 1995 and earlier standards, which used aggregate plant MSW capacity as the dividing line between categories of MWC units, "plant" was defined to mean the same thing as facility.  The 1995 standards define a plant as "one or more [MWC] units at the same location" and use plant and facility interchangeably in identifying the MWC units subject to particular emissions controls;  for example, the NSPS for new units are described as applying to "each new MWC unit located at an MWC facility that has an aggregate [MSW] plant capacity" above 35 Mg/day.  1995 Standards, 60 Fed.Reg. at 65,391, 65,415;  see also 1989 Proposed Guidelines, 54 Fed.Reg. at 52,219 ("[f]or purposes of determining the regulatory size category of an existing MWC plant, the capacity of all the existing MWCs at the same location would be aggregated").  To follow the EPA's lead and read unit capacity as meaning aggregate plant capacity in section 129 would therefore essentially equate a unit with a facility, in the face of explicit congressionally approved text providing that units and facilities are not identical.


40
The cumulative evidence thus suggests that while Congress desired to build upon the 1989 proposed standards, it did not intend to adopt the same categories of MWC units that the regulations had established, and that the phrase "small units" was simply used in congressional deliberations as a shorthand reference to units located at plants with a small aggregate plant MSW capacity.  Given that section 129 distinguishes between units and facilities in its definitional subsection, it seems likely that if Congress had meant unit capacity (or to parrot the exact language of section 129(a)(1), "units with capacity") to refer to aggregate plant MSW capacity, it would have said just that.  Significantly, Title III of the 1990 CAA amendments also contained provisions amending section 112 of CAA, which governs emissions of hazardous air pollutants, making it clear that the EPA was to determine the aggregate emissions of all of the stationary sources at a particular site in assessing whether a source constituted a "major source."   The definition of major source added to section 112 by the 1990 CAA amendments says it "means any stationary source or group of stationary sources located within a contiguous area and under common control" that potentially emits "in the aggregate, 10 tons per year or more of any hazardous air pollutant or 25 tons per year or more of any combination of hazardous pollutants."  42 U.S.C. § 7412(a)(1);  see also 136 CONG. REC.  S16,927-29 (daily ed. Oct. 27, 1990) (Statement of Sen.  Durenberger) (discussing definition of major source under section 112), reprinted in 1 LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, at 864-69.  We naturally find it difficult to accept that Congress would specifically instruct the EPA to determine the applicability of emissions controls on an aggregate basis in one section of the 1990 CAA amendments and not do so in neighboring section, if in fact it had the same intent regarding the second section as well.


41
We finally conclude that the 1995 standards conflict with the plain meaning of section 129 and exceed the EPA's statutory authority under section 129 of the CAA.  Section 129 creates two categories of MWC units based on unit capacity, units with unit MSW capacities above 250 tons/day and units with unit MSW capacities of 250 tons/day or less.  The 1995 standards ignore the categories of MWC units created in section 129 and group MWC units on the basis of aggregate MSW capacity instead of unit MSW capacity for MACT purposes.  Although the EPA has some discretion to distinguish among MWC units in setting emissions standards, section 129 does not give it authority to ignore the categories that Congress established, and "[i]t is axiomatic that an administrative agency's power to promulgate legislative regulations is limited to the authority delegated by Congress."  Bowen v. Georgetown Univ.  Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 208, 109 S.Ct. 468, 471, 102 L.Ed.2d 493 (1988).III. REMEDY


42
In light of the preceding discussion, we have no choice but to vacate substantial portions of the 1995 standards, based on our conclusion that they exceed the EPA's statutory authority.  It is not immediately apparent to us, however, that all of the 1995 standards must be vacated.  As discussed above, the effect of recategorizing by unit capacity will be to shift some units in what is currently the large plant category to what is now the small plant category.  This shift likely will not affect the NSPS for new units, regardless of unit capacity.  The MACT floor for new units is the level of control achieved by the best controlled similar unit, which in the case of new units at large plants is a unit with a GCP/SD/FF/SNCR/CI system and for new units at small plants is a unit with a GCP/SD/FF/CI system.  Unless the units shifted to the small plant category were the only units employing GCP/SD/FF/SNCR/CI controls--a proposition that seems highly improbable based on the record--the MACT floor and standards for new units at large plants should remain the same.  Similarly, the MACT floors and standards for new units at small plants might possibly be affected by the recategorization if the units shifted used SNCR and did not use a distinguishable form of combustor (i.e., a mass burn or modular combustor), which also appears to be an unlikely scenario.


43
As MACT floors for existing units are determined by calculating the average emissions limitations achieved by the best performing 12 percent of units in a given category, recategorizing MWC units is likely to have an effect on the standards for existing units.  But it may still be the case that the new MACT floors for existing units with unit capacities above 250 tons/day will be nearly the same as those proposed for the large plant category in the 1995 standards, provided the emissions control achieved by the best performing 12 percent of units that remain in the large plant category is still the level of control obtainable with a SD/FF or ESP/SNCR/CI system.  On the other hand, it is clear that the recategorization will affect the MACT floors for existing units with unit capacities of 250 tons/day or less, which previously were in the small plant category.  Unless the EPA subcategorizes MWC units in this category by location or other factors, the standards for these units will become significantly more stringent.


44
Thus, it is possible that only the standards applicable to existing units in the small plant category must be vacated.  At oral argument, however, counsel for the EPA stated that he believed the 1995 standards would need to be vacated in their entirety if we were to decide that MWC units had to be recategorized by unit capacity.  Given this acknowledgment, and the fact that it is not entirely clear from the record precisely which standards will have to be changed and to what extent, we vacate the 1995 standards in their entirety and remand to the EPA for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  On remand, the EPA may reissue those standards, if any, that are not affected by our decision if it determines that these standards are still appropriate.


45
Since we vacate the 1995 standards in their entirety, we do not reach petitioners' other challenges.  We also do not reach CKRC's claim that the EPA erred in interpreting section 129 to apply to industrial furnaces such as cement kilns or its argument that the EPA cannot apply the existing or future standards to cement kilns without studying their unique operation in more depth.  We recognize that, if the EPA simply reissues the standards that are not affected by recategorizing MWC units by unit capacity, CKRC may be forced to reinstitute its challenges, and CKRC's second argument, particularly, is not without plausibility.  But because we vacate the 1995 standards in their entirety, our consideration of these matters awaits another day.

IV. CONCLUSION

46
We hold that the EPA's use of aggregate plant MSW capacity rather than unit MSW capacity in the 1995 standards to create categories of MWC units for MACT purposes violates the plain meaning of section 129 and exceeds the EPA's statutory authority.  We therefore vacate the 1995 standards in their entirety on this ground and remand to the EPA, without reaching the additional challenges raised by petitioners and CKRC.


47
So ordered.



1
 SD and DSI are "scrubbers," referred to as such because they function by "scrubbing" pollutants out of the gas stream that results from combustion.  In SD, lime slurry is sprayed into a SD vessel through which the gas stream flows.  The lime and acid gases react to form sulfate salts.  In DSI, a powdered sorbent (such as lime, hydrated lime or sodium bicarbonate) is pneumatically injected into a section of either the flue gas duct or the furnace part of a MWC unit, whereupon the sorbent reacts with acid gases to form alkali salts.  To be effective, scrubbers must be used in conjunction with devices that capture particulate matter, including the salts and other substances produced by the scrubbers.  FF and ESP are such devices.  A FF, often referred to as a baghouse, consists of a series of cylindrical bags through which the combustion gas stream is filtered and the particulate matter released by the scrubber are captured.  An ESP imparts an electrical charge to particles that causes the particulate matter in the gas stream to adhere to metal plates in the ESP.  Rapping on the plates causes the particlesto fall into a hopper for disposal.  See 1989 Proposed NSPS, 54 Fed.Reg. 52,263-64;  Proposed Guidelines, 54 Fed.Reg. at 52,220-22;  see also Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards,EPA, Pub. No. EPA-450/3-89-924c, Municipal Waste Combustors-Background Information for Proposed Standards:  Post-Combustion Technology Performance (August 1989)


2
 GCP are procedures designed to ensure that MWC units are properly designed, constructed, operated and maintained.  Material separation involves excluding certain materials that are particularly likely to release hazardous substances when combusted, such as tires or batteries, or separating materials that can be recycled to lower the amount of MSW being combusted.  1989 Proposed NSPS, 54 Fed.Reg. at 52,263-64;  1989 Proposed Guidelines, 54 Fed.Reg. at 52,220-23


3
 "Standards" is used here to refer to both NSPS and emissions guidelines


4
 Section 129(g)(5) actually refers to "municipal waste" as opposed to MSW, but it is apparent from the fact that section 129 addresses solid waste incineration units that the type of municipal waste at issue is MSW


5
 SNCR involves injecting of ammonia, urea, or urea and methanol into the combustor to reduce the emission of nitrogen oxides.  1994 Proposed NSPS, 59 Fed.Reg. at 48,213-24;  1994 Proposed Guidelines, 59 Fed.Reg. at 48,243-44;  see also Leslie L. Sloss et al., NITROGEN OXIDES CONTROL TECHNOLOGY FACT BOOK 97-101 (1992) ("NITROGEN OXIDES FACT BOOK"))


6
 Units built or modified after December 20, 1989, but before September 20, 1994, were subject to the 1991 NSPS as well as the 1994 emission guidelines.  1994 Proposed Guidelines, 59 Fed.Reg. at 48,230


7
 The 1994 proposed standards, as well as the 1995 final standards, actually define large and small plants in terms of MSW capacity measured in Mg/day instead of tons/day--large plants are defined as plants with an aggregate MSW capacity above 225 Mg/day, while small plants are plants with an aggregate MSW capacity of 225 Mg/day or less.  One megagram is equivalent to 2,204 pounds or 1.1 short tons, and thus 225 Mg is close to 250 tons.  See 1994 Proposed NSPS, 59 Fed.Reg. at 48,198;  1994 Proposed Guidelines, 59 Fed.Reg. at 48,228.   Given that the EPA treats these measurements, 225 Mg/day and 250 tons/day, as equivalent, and that the provision of section 129 at issue refers to 250 tons/day, this opinion refers to 250 tons/day instead of 225 Mg/day


8
 CI involves injecting powdered activated carbon into the flue gas after combustion but before the gas stream reaches the scrubber or particulate matter devices.  The carbon is a catalyst for oxidation of mercury into forms that can be more readily captured by these devices.  1994 Proposed Guidelines, 59 Fed.Reg. at 48,243-44.   SNCR was not required for large existing mass burn refractory units.  Proposed Guidelines, 59 Fed.Reg. at 48,233, 48,247


9
 The extent of any decrease in stringency of the emissions controls applicable to petitioners' units that would result from determining MACT floors based on unit MSW capacities is unclear, as MACT floors and standards for the small plant category would have to be recalculated if petitioners' units and other similarly situated units were shifted to the category


10
 Although this subsection is titled "New source performance standards," it is apparent from the references to emission guidelines and existing units in section 129(a)(1)(A) that the subsection addresses the promulgation of emissions standards for all solid waste incineration units, and not just new source performance standards for new units


11
 We emphasize that we do not hold that the EPA is precluded from ever taking a unit's location into account, but simply that EPA cannot use location to override the MWC unit categories established by Congress.  Section 129(a)(2) gives the EPA broad discretion to differentiate among units in a category, and there is nothing in the text of section 129(a)(2) that would prevent the EPA from subcategorizing within the two categories of MWC units established by Congress on the basis of the units' location, provided the EPA indicated why such a subcategorization was appropriate


12
 Again, whether the new emission standards for petitioners' units and other similarly situated units are in fact less stringent than the emissions standards imposed on these units in 1995 will depend on whether the EPA utilizes its discretion to create subcategories within the small unit category or justifies imposing standards on these units that are more stringent than the MACT floor


                                                                           FILED

      Because Linares-Henriquez failed to establish eligibility for asylum, she

necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal.

Henriquez failed to establish eligibility for CAT relief because she did not establish

a likelihood of torture in El Salvador. See Santos-Lemus, 542 F.3d at 747-48.

      Finally, Linares-Henriquez’s due process contention regarding the BIA’s

streamlined decision is foreclosed by Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, 350 F.3d 845,

IN RE JOEL L. HERNANDEZ, RELATOR

_______________________________





Before QUINN, C.J., and CAMPBELL and HANCOCK, JJ.

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF

MANDAMUS AND PROHIBITION 



By a petition for a writ of mandamus and prohibition, relator Joel L. Hernandez requests issuance of mandamus directing the Honorable Larry B. “Rusty” Ladd, Presiding Judge of the Lubbock County Court at Law No. 1, and Lubbock County, to conduct a “judicial inquiry” or hearing into the extension of his jail time pursuant to article 43.09 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  
See
 Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 43.09 (Vernon 2007).  
See also 
Tex. R. App. P. 52.1.  Relator also requests that we direct the trial court judge to act on his application for writ of habeas corpus.  We will deny relator’s petition.

Relator’s petition states he currently is incarcerated in the Lubbock County Jail.  Relator was convicted in the Lubbock County Court at Law No. 1 of the misdemeanor offense of assault-domestic violence.  
See 
Tex. Penal Code Ann. § 22.01(a) (Vernon 2007).  He was sentenced to 365 days in jail and a fine and court costs in the amount of $4309.  This Court affirmed appellant’s conviction on September 24, 2008. 
See Hernandez v. State,
 280 S.W.3d 384 (Tex.App.–Amarillo 2008, no pet.).  According to relator’s petition, he filed an application for writ of habeas corpus with the trial court on May 26, 2009 asserting violations of his statutory and constitutional rights and requesting the trial court conduct a “judicial inquiry” as to his inability to pay the imposed fine and costs and his continued jail time pursuant to article 43.09.  
In response, relator asserts, the trial court sent him a letter informing him that the court was closed until June 22, 2009 and Judge Ladd was “on vacation.”
(footnote: 1) 

Thereafter, on June 24, relator filed his petition for writ of mandamus and prohibition with this Court, asking us to: (1) consider his petition on a “fast-track accelerated schedule;” (2) order respondents to file an accelerated reply to this petition; (3) order respondents to issue the writ process, requiring the Lubbock County District Attorney to file a reply to the writ application filed in the trial court; (4) order respondents to render a final writ decision following a mandatory evidentiary hearing; and (5) in the alternative, to transfer this case to the nearest county court at law in the event the trial court is “on vacation.”

A writ of prohibition directs a lower court to refrain from doing some act while a writ of mandamus commands a lower court to do some act. 
In re Lambert
, 993 S.W.2d 123, 126 (Tex.App.–San Antonio 1999, orig. proceeding), 
citing Tilton v. Marshall
, 925 S.W.2d 672, 676 n.4 (Tex.1996).  Prohibition is an extraordinary proceeding and should be used sparingly. 
Guerra v. Garza, 
987 S.W.2d 593, 594 (Tex.Crim.App.1999).   Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy available only in limited circumstances, and not for grievances that may be addressed by other remedies.  
Walker v. Packer
, 827 S.W.2d 833, 840 (Tex.1992) (orig. proceeding).  
  

As noted, relator’s petition refers both to a writ of mandamus and writ of prohibition.  A writ of prohibition has three principal functions: 1) preventing interference with higher courts in deciding a pending appeal; 2) preventing an inferior court from entertaining suits that would relitigate controversies already settled by the issuing court; and 3) prohibiting a trial court's action when it affirmatively appears the court lacks jurisdiction.  
Humble Exploration Co., Inc. v. Walker,
 641 S.W.2d 941, 943 (Tex.App.–Dallas 1982, writ ref’d); 
In re Staley,
 No. 07-00-0467-CV, 2001 WL 25692 (Tex.App.–Amarillo 2001, orig. proceeding).  A writ of prohibition issues only to prevent the threatened commission of a future act.  
State ex rel. Rodriguez v. Onion,
 741 S.W.2d 433, 435 (Tex.Crim.App. 1987).  Relator does not  ask this Court for relief consistent with a request for a writ of prohibition, and his request for such a writ will be denied.



Turning to relator’s petition for a writ of mandamus, relator states he filed his application for a writ of habeas corpus in the trial court on May 26 and the court had not acted on it by the time he filed his petition in this Court on June 24.  Mandamus relief is authorized in a criminal case if the relator establishes that (1) he has no other adequate legal remedy and (2) the act sought to be compelled is purely ministerial. 
State ex rel. Rosenthal v. Poe
, 98 S.W.3d 194, 198 (Tex.Crim.App. 2003).  Regarding the first requirement, there is no right to appeal in a misdemeanor case in which a trial judge refuses to issue a post-conviction writ of habeas corpus or to grant a hearing on the merits of the applicant's claim. 
Ex parte Crosley,
 548 S.W.2d 409 (Tex.Crim.App.1977).  In the current matter, it is unclear that the trial court has refused to rule or hold a hearing.  Rather, it may be that the application has not been brought to the attention of the trial court.
(footnote: 2)
	Even assuming relator’s petition establishes appeal is not available to him, however, the unavailability of an appeal does not automatically make mandamus available. 
See In re Piper, 
105 S.W.3d 107, 110-11 (Tex.App.–Waco 2003, orig. proceeding).  
In circumstances similar to those relator alleges, Texas courts have found the relator to have an adequate legal remedy by filing the application for writ of habeas corpus in another court having habeas jurisdiction.  
See, e.g., In re Wiley,
 No. 12-07-00167-CR, 2007 WL 2178558 (Tex.App.–Tyler July 31, 2007, orig. proceeding)
; Piper
, 105 S.W.3d at 110-11. 
See also
 
Onion
, 741 S.W.2d at 434 (district courts also have power to issue writ of habeas corpus, and Code of Criminal Procedure article 11.09 does not deprive them of that power in cases involving misdemeanors).
(footnote: 3)  
See generally Ex parte Schmidt
, 109 S.W.3d 480, 481 (Tex.Crim.App. 2003).

Here, relator’s petition is based on the assumption that a writ of mandamus issued by this Court is his only remedy.  But the law provides another legal remedy, and relator has not shown it to be inadequate.  
See, e.g., In re Altschul
, 236 S.W.3d 453, 456 (Tex.App.–Waco 2007, orig. proceeding) (distinguishing 
Piper
 and finding mandamus available).  Accordingly, relator’s petition for mandamus and prohibition both are denied.

FOOTNOTES
1:1 
Relator has not provided us a copy of the letter he says he received from the trial court.
 
 
See
 Tex. R. App. P. 52.3(k) (requiring an appendix containing, among other items, “a certified or sworn copy of any order complained of, or any other document showing the matter complained of”).
  
Moreover, the copy of application for writ of habeas corpus relator has provided us bears no file-mark or other indication the application was filed.  These procedural defects alone would require us to deny relator’s petition.
  For purposes of this opinion, however, we will assume the accuracy of relator’s statements concerning his filing of the application.  Further, relator’s petition fails to comply with appellate rule 52.3 in several other respects, in that it contains no table of contents, index of authorities, statement of the case, or statement of jurisdiction.

Petitions for Review of a Final Order of the Federal Communications Commission
Before SMITH, DUHE, and EMILIO M. GARZA, Circuit Judges.
JERRY E. SMITH, Circuit Judge:


1
This is a consolidated challenge to the most recent attempt of the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") to implement provisions of the landmark 1996 Telecommunications Act (the "Act").1 Petitioners, joined by numerous intervenors, challenge several aspects of the FCC's Universal Service Order (the "Order") implementing the provisions of the Act codified at 47 U.S.C. § 254. We grant the petition for review in part, deny it in part, affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand in part.


2
I. Background.


3
A. The 1996 Act and the Universal Service Order.


4
Beginning with the passage of the Communications Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act"), Congress has made universal service a basic goal of telecommunications regulation. As Section 1 of the 1934 Act stated, the FCC was created


5
[f]or the purpose of regulating interstate and foreign commerce in communication by wire and radio so as to make available, so far as possible, to all the people of the United States, without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communication service with adequatefacilities at reasonable charges . . . .


6
47 U.S.C. § 151 (as amended).


7
Armed with this statutory mandate, the FCC historically has focused on increasing the availability of reasonably priced, basic telephone service via the landline telecommunications network.2 Rather than relying on market forces alone, the agency has used a combination of implicit and explicit subsidies to achieve its goal of greater telephone subscribership. Explicit subsidies provide carriers or individuals with specific grants that can be used to pay for or reduce the charges for telephone service. This form of subsidy includes using revenues from line charges on end-users to subsidize high-cost service directly and to support the Lifeline Assistance program for low-income subscribers.


8
Implicit subsidies are more complicated and involve the manipulation of rates for some customers to subsidize more affordable rates for others. For example, the regulators may require the carrier to charge "above-cost" rates to low-cost, profitable urban customers to offer the "below-cost" rates to expensive, unprofitable rural customers.


9
For obvious reasons, this system of implicit subsidies can work well only under regulated conditions. In a competitive environment, a carrier that tries to subsidize below-cost rates to rural customers with above-cost rates to urban customers is vulnerable to a competitor that offers at-cost rates to urban customers. Because opening local telephone markets to competition is a principal objective of the Act, Congress recognized that the universal service system of implicit subsidies would have to be re-examined.


10
To attain the goal of local competition while preserving universal service, Congress directed the FCC to replace the patchwork of explicit and implicit subsidies with "specific, predictable and sufficient Federal and State mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service." 47 U.S.C. § 254(b)(5). Congress also specified new universal service support for schools, libraries, and rural health care providers. See 47 U.S.C. § 254(h). It then directed the FCC to define such a system and to establish a timetable for implementation within fifteen months of the passage of the Act.


11
The Federal-State Joint Board (the "Joint Board"), created by the Act to coordinate federal and state regulatory interests, issued two recommendations on how to implement the universal service provisions.3 The FCC met the statutory deadline when it issued the Order on May 8, 1997.4 Since that time, the agency has issued seven reconsideration orders (the last one on May 28, 1999) and has madetwo reports to Congress regarding the Order.


12
The FCC designated a set of core services eligible for universal service support, proposed a mechanism for supporting those services, and established a timetable for implementation. See Order ¶¶ 21-42. Pursuant to the Act, the agency developed rules for modifying the existing system of support for high-cost service areas and created new support programs for schools, libraries, and health care facilities.


13
1. High-cost Support.


14
The FCC's plans for changing the high-cost support system required it to resolve a number of complicated issues, including (1) what methodology to use for calculating high-cost support; (2) how to allocate costs between the states and the federal government; (3) which carriers should be required to contribute to the support system; and (4) when to implement the high-cost support program. The agency resolved the question of how to calculate the proper amount of high-cost support by accepting the Joint Board's second recommendation to identify areas where the forward-looking cost of service exceeds a cost-based benchmark and to provide extra support to any state that cannot maintain reasonable comparability.5 See Second Recommended Decision ¶ 19; Seventh Report and Order ¶ 61 n.157.


15
Most importantly, the FCC decided to use the "forward-looking" costs to calculate the relevant costs of a carrier serving a given geographical area. In other words, to encourage carriers to act efficiently, the agency would base its calculation on the costs an efficient carrier would incur (rather than the costs the incumbent carriers historically have incurred).6


16
The FCC developed rules for determining which carriers should be required to contribute to the interstate universal service support system and how their contributions should be calculated. It decided to require all telecommunications carriers and certain non-telecommunications carriers to contribute in proportion to their share of end-user telecommunications revenues. See Order ¶¶ 39-42. The agency determined that to reduce the burden on individual carriers' prices, the carriers' contribution base should be as broad as possible. See Order ¶ 783. Therefore, the agency required contributing carriers to include their international telecommunications revenues in their contribution base and rejected claims by certain carriers,7 which do not receive direct subsidies fromthe support program, seeking an exemption from making any contributions. See Order ¶ 805.


17
Finally, the FCC adopted a timetable for implementing its high-cost support plan. Because it has not yet developed an accurate assessment of forward-looking costs, it delayed implementation of its support program for non-rural carriers until January 1, 2000.8 Additionally, because the agency believes it will take even longer to develop accurate forward-looking cost models for rural carriers, it delayed the implementation of its new support plan for rural carriers to "no sooner than January 1, 2001." See Order ¶ 204.


18
During this delay in implementation, the FCC decided that carriers will continue to receive support at the levels generated by existing universal support programs. According to the agency, this gradual, phased-in plan for implementing its new high-cost support system meets the Act's requirement of a "specific timetable for completion." See 47 U.S.C. § 254(a)(2).


19
2. Schools and Libraries.


20
Pursuant to § 254(h), the FCC adopted rules implementing new programs for schools, libraries, and health care facilities, in particular by providing universal service support for internet access and internal connections in schools and libraries. See Order ¶ 436. The agency decided that any entity, including non-telecommunications carriers, that provides internet access or internal connections to schools and libraries will receive universal service support. See Order ¶ 594.


21
To fund the new § 254(h) programs, the FCC accepted the Joint Board's recommendation to assess the interstate and intrastate revenues of providers of interstate telecommunications service. See Order ¶ 808. Because many states do not already have similar support programs for schools and libraries, the agency justified its inclusion of intrastate revenues as necessary to ensure adequate funding for § 254(h) programs.


22
B. Challenges to the Order.


23
On September 5, 1997, petitioner Celpage Inc. filed a motion in this court to stay the Order. We denied that motion on October 16, 1997, and rejected a similar motion by various rural telephone companies on December 31, 1997. Their petitions, along with challenges to the Order by other petitioners, were consolidated in this court.


24
There are two sets of challenges to the Order. The first regards the FCC's plan for replacing the current mixture of explicit and implicit subsidies with an explicit universal service support system for high-cost areas. On both statutory and constitutional grounds, petitioners attack (1) the methodology for calculating support under the plan; (2) the allocation of funding responsibilities between the FCC and the states; and (3) the agency's restrictions on how carriers can recover universal service costs.


25
Other petitioners attack the FCC's high-cost support plan as an encroachment on state authority over intrastate telecommunications regulation because it restricts state eligibility requirements and imposes a "no disconnect" rule for low-income telephone subscribers. Petitioners also challenge, for lack of specificity and for failing to delay implementation of the plan for some rural carriers, the FCC's timetable for implementing the new universal service plan. Additionally, petitioners challenge the FCC's system for assessing contributions, arguing that it improperly includes CMRS providers and unfairly assesses carriers on the basis of their international and interstate revenues.


26
The second set of challenges regards the FCC's proposal for implementing § 254(h)programs supporting schools, libraries, and health care providers. Petitioners claim that the FCC impermissibly expanded the scope of § 254(h) support to include the provision of internet access and internal connections. Moreover, they attack the FCC's statutory authority to provide such support to non-telecommunications providers.


27
Additionally, petitioners charge that the agency encroached on state authority to implement state support programs for schools and libraries and failed to designate which telecommunications services will receive § 254(h) support. They also argue that the  FCC exceeded its statutory authority by requiring subsidies for toll-free telephone calls to internet service providers by non-rural health care providers. Finally, they attack the FCC's § 254(h) contribution system because it assesses both the intrastate and interstate revenues of carriers.9


28
We affirm most of the FCC's decisions regarding its implementation of the high-cost support system, concluding, for the most part, that the Order violates neither the statutory requirements nor the Constitution. We remand for further consideration, however, as to the FCC's decision to assess contributions from carriers based on both international and interstate revenues. We also reverse (1) the requirement that ILEC's recover their contributions from access charges and (2) the blanket prohibition on additional state eligibility requirements for carriers receiving high-cost support.


29
On jurisdictional grounds, we reverse the rule prohibiting local telephone service providers from disconnecting low-income subscribers. We also conclude that the agency exceeded its jurisdictional authority when it assessed contributions for § 254(h) "schools and libraries" programs based on the combined intrastate and interstate revenues of interstate telecommunications providers and when it asserted its jurisdictional authority to do the same on behalf of high-cost support.


30
II. Standard of Review.


31
When deciding whether the FCC has the statutory authority to adopt the rules included in the Order, we review the agency's interpretation under Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), by first deciding whether "Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue," id. at 842. If so, we "give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress." Id. at 842-43. In this situation, we reverse an agency's interpretation if it does not conform to the plain meaning of the statute. This level of review is often called "Chevron step-one" review.


32
Where the statute is silent or ambiguous, however, "the question for the court is whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute." Id. at 843. We may reverse the agency's construction of an ambiguous or silent provision only if we find it "arbitrary, capricious or manifestly contrary to the statute." Id. at 844. That is to say, we will sustain an agency interpretation of an ambiguous statute if the interpretation "is based on a permissible construction of the statute."Id. at 843. We refer to this more deferential level of review as "Chevron step-two" review.


33
The Administrative Procedure Act ("APA") also authorizes us to reverse an agency's action if it acted arbitrarily or capriciously in adopting its interpretation by failing to give a reasonable explanation for how it reached its decision. See 5 U.S.C. § 706 (2)(A) (1994); see also Harris v. United States, 19 F.3d 1090 (5th Cir. 1994). "Arbitrary and capricious" review under the APA differs from Chevron step-two review, because it focuses on the reasonability of the agency's decision-making processes rather than on the reasonability of its interpretation.10


34
Finally, we do not give the FCC's actions the usual deference when reviewing a potential violation of a constitutional right. "The intent of Congress in 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B) was that courts should make an independent assessment of a citizen's claim of constitutional right when reviewing agency decision-making." Porter v. Califano, 592 F.2d 770, 780 (5th Cir. 1979).


35
III. Analysis.


36
A. High-cost Support.


37
1. Methodology for Calculating Support for High-cost Areas.


38
a. Forward-looking Cost-of-Service Methodology.


39
GTE and Southwestern Bell (collectively "GTE") and the FCC engage in a fairly complex economic debate over the merits of calculating costs using the forward-looking cost models based on the "least cost, most efficient" carrier.11 Becauseincumbent local exchange carriers ("ILEC's") such as GTE will receive their subsidies, under the new system, based on the difference between the costs of providing service to a high-cost region and the revenue that could be derived from that service, GTE fears that using the costs of a hypothetical most-efficient carrier will significantly reduce the amount of universal service support it receives.


40
i. Statutory Interpretation.


41
The question, of course, is not whether it is good policy for the FCC to use such cost models,12 but whether the decision to adopt this methodology conforms to the plain language of the statute. If the language is ambiguous, we must then ask whether the use of forward-looking cost models is reasonable given the terms of the statute and the deference the FCC must be afforded under Chevron. Additionally, we must consider whether the agency's actions in reaching its decision are "arbitrary and capricious" under the APA. See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).


42
We conclude that the plain language is ambiguous as to whether the FCC's cost models are permitted. We then decide that under Chevron step-two, the FCC's forward-looking cost models are authorized under their reasonable interpretations of the statutory language. Finally, we do not conclude that the FCC acted in a "arbitrary and capricious" manner in reaching its decision to adopt forward-looking cost models.


43
GTE argues that the methodology violates the "equitable and nondiscriminatory" language in § 254(b)(4). We disagree with GTE's claim that the plain language of § 254(b)(4) prohibits the FCC from adopting its methodology.


44
The section of the statute that GTE relies on represents one of seven principles identified by the statute as the basis for the agency's universal service policies. Rather than setting up specific conditions or requirements, § 254(b) reflects a Congressional intent to delegate these difficult policy choices to agency discretion: "The Joint Board and the Commission shall base policies for the preservation and advancement of universal service on the following principles . . . ." (Emphasis added.) 47 U.S.C. § 254(b).


45
Moreover, the FCC has offered reasonable explanations for how its use of the forward-looking cost models cannot be characterized as inequitable and discriminatory. For instance, the FCC points out that all carriers, including interexchange carriers ("IXC's") such as AT&T and MCI, are subject to the same cost methodology and must move toward the same efficient cost level to maximize the benefits of universal service support.


46
The term "sufficient" appears in § 254(e), and the plain language of § 254(e) makes sufficiency of universal service support a direct statutory command rather than a statement of one of several principles. Still, we do not find that the use of the single word "sufficient," even in the language of command, demonstrates Congress's unambiguous intent regarding the forward-looking cost models. We therefore review under Chevron step-two and conclude that the agency has offered reasonable justifications for its adoption of the "most efficient" methodology.


47
The FCC points to cases in which agencies have adopted similar methodologies to encourage competition.13 It also argues that nothing in the statute defines "sufficient" to mean that universal service support must equal the actual costs incurred by ILEC's. These reasons suffice to survive the reasonableness requirement of Chevron step-two.


48
To be sure, the FCC's reason for adopting this methodology is not just to preserve universal service. Rather, it is also trying to encourage local competition by setting the cost models at the "most efficient" level so that carriers will have the incentive to improve operations. As long as it can reasonably argue that the methodology will provide sufficient support for universal service, however, it is free, under the deference we afford it under Chevron step-two, to adopt a methodology that serves its other goal of encouraging local competition.


49
ii. "Arbitrary and Capricious."


50
Arguing that the FCC has departed from its own stated methodology, GTE charges the agency with "arbitrary and capricious" actions under the APA. See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). The APA's "arbitrary and capricious" standard of review is narrow and requires only a finding that the agency "articulate[d] a rational relationship between the facts found and the choice made."  Harris v. United States, 19 F.3d 1090, 1096 (5th Cir. 1994).


51
GTE points out that while the agency has wedded itself to the "most efficient" carrier cost methodology, it used current depreciation schedules to develop its models for projecting forward-looking costs. These schedules are not based on the actual costs of the current regulated system, but, GTE contends, have been artificially deflated by state regulators so that local carriers recover less than they would in a real, competitive market. Using these artificially-deflated schedules in the cost models disadvantages the ILEC's, because they will not be able to recover their capital costs as they would if free from regulation.


52
Actually, the FCC has departed from its general "most efficient" methodology by making a number of adjustments to its cost model. For instance, instead of assuming the "most efficient" wire center locations in its cost models, the agency simply made calculations based on whatever wire centers already exist. See Order ¶ 251(1). This allowance actually benefits the ILEC's.


53
While GTE argues that the FCC's failure to adhere tightly to its "most efficient"methodology fails the "arbitrary and capricious" test, that test, properly understood, is far less onerous. If the FCC's departures from its methodology "articulate a rational relationship," we will not apply the "arbitrary and capricious" remedy.


54
The FCC seeks to mitigate the effect of the "most efficient" methodology by accounting for wire centers that already exist. Additionally, and contrary to GTE's assertions, the agency is prescribing a range within which the depreciation schedules must fall, rather than simply adopting the schedules that already exist. For the time being, the FCC will rely on the actual depreciation schedules, because it does not see a prospect of significant competition in the near future in the high-cost markets. See Order ¶ 250(5). Moreover, the agency has committed itself to re-prescribe the range for these schedules every three years. See id. ¶ 250(5) n.662. These reasons establish enough of a "rational relationship" with facts presented for the forward-looking cost methodology to pass the APA's arbitrary and capricious test.14


55
b. Methodology for Calculating the Revenue Benchmark.


56
GTE challenged the inclusion of revenues from "discretionary" services in the revenue benchmark used to compare costs and revenues for the purposes of universal service support. The Joint Board, however, recently proposed eliminating the entire revenue benchmark in favor of a single national cost benchmark. See Second Recommended Decision ¶¶ 41-50. The FCC accepted this recommendation. See Seventh Report and Order ¶ 61 ("[W]e reconsider and reject the determination in the First Report and Order that federal support for rate comparability should be determined using a revenue-based benchmark.").15 This decision moots GTE's challenge to the inclusion of discretionary revenues, because no revenues will be used in the calculation of the benchmark.16


57
A case becomes moot if (1) there is no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will recur and (2) interim relief or events have completely and irrevocablyeradicated the effects of the alleged violation. County of Los Angeles v. Davis, 440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979).17 The FCC's new approach eradicates any possible effect of discretionary revenues on the levels of the petitioners' universal service support.18 We therefore dismiss, as moot, GTE's challenge to the use of discretionary revenues in the high-cost support benchmark.


58
GTE also challenged the FCC's use of a national benchmark for purposes of revenue calculations. Because GTE's challenge focused on the problems of a national revenue benchmark, the FCC's elimination of the revenue benchmark also moots its challenge to the national benchmark.


59
GTE's basic attack on the national revenue benchmark is that ILEC's operating in states with below-average revenues will be systematically undercompensated by a universal service support system based on a national revenue benchmark. But none of these arguments necessarily applies to a cost-based national benchmark.19 Indeed, the FCC adopted the cost-based national benchmark because it agreed that "revenues may not accurately reflect the level of need for support to enable reasonably comparable rates because states have varying rate-setting methods and goals." Seventh Report and Order ¶ 62.


60
Because the subject matter of GTE's appeal--a national revenue benchmark--no longer has any legal force, "[a]ny further judicial pronouncements . . . would be purely advisory." See Center for Science in the Public Interest, 727 F.2d at 1164. "We cannot assume jurisdiction to decide a case on the ground that it is the same case as one presented to us, when it is admitted that it is not and when it presents different issues." Id. at 1166 n.6 (emphasis added). Therefore, we also dismiss, as moot, thechallenges to the FCC's national revenue benchmark.20


61
c. Limiting the Federal Mechanism to Twenty-five Percent of Universal Service Costs.


62
The third step in the FCC's methodology for calculating support to high-cost, non-rural areas allocates 25% of the funding responsibility to the agency, leaving 75% to be provided by the states. In other words, only 25% of the overall funds for the explicit universal support program for high-cost areas will be provided from the funds collected from interstate telephone calls; the rest must be provided by the states, usually through charges on intrastate service. Certain states,21 GTE, and Kansas and Vermont22 challenged this allocation on statutory grounds. Specifically, they question the 25% rule for failing to provide "sufficient" support under § 254(e). Kansas and Vermont also challenged the FCC's 25% allocation decision for lack of notice and for failing to ensure reasonable comparability between rural and urban rates.


63
As in the case of arguments against the revenue benchmark, we do not consider these challenges, because the FCC has accepted the Joint Board's recommendation to scrap the 25%/75% rule.23 The Seventh Report and Order proposes a new methodology that places "no artificial limits on the amount of federal support that is available" when a state cannot by itself maintain reasonable comparability. Seventh Report and Order ¶ 34. This new framework is "a different regulation, containing on its face reasoning not previously articulated by the agency as its policy." Center for Science in the Pub. Interest, 727 F.2d at 1166. Therefore, we dismiss the challenges by all of the petitioners as moot.24


64
d. Properly Consulting with the Joint Board Before Amending Jurisdictional Separations Rules.


65
GTE raises an administrative procedural objection to the FCC's adoption of new jurisdictional separations rules25 that propose to end existing high-cost fund support for non-rural carriers on January 1, 1999.26 Instead of arguing that the new rule is arbitrary and capricious, GTE claims that the agency failed properly to refer the matter to the Joint Board, in violation of 47 U.S.C. § 410(c), which states that "[t]he Commission shall refer any proceeding regarding the jurisdictional separation of common carrier property and expenses between interstate and intrastate operations . . . to a Federal-State Joint Board."


66
The FCC responds that it did make a general referral to the Joint Board in March 1996 and that the Joint Board subsequently recommended that the agency replace the existing support mechanisms for non-rural carriers with a new universal service system. The plan to replace the existing support mechanism, the FCC argues, requires a change in the method of jurisdictional separation, and by recommending the plan, the Joint Board had already considered the jurisdictional effects.27


67
GTE and the FCC disagree on the level of specificity needed to fulfill the Joint Board consultation requirement of § 410(c). GTE argues that simply identifying the broad subject of universal service reform did not raise the issue of altering the system that is used to shift costs in many high-cost areas to the interstate jurisdiction. In particular, GTE contends that the Joint Board failed to consider the amounts of the fund allocation between the interstate and intrastate jurisdictions when it considered the plan to implement a new support mechanism.


68
Although the FCC does not have to raise every possible detail in its referral to the Joint Board, it must show that the Joint Board was aware of the effects on the jurisdictional separations rules of replacing the existing high-cost support system. The plain language of the statute shows that any shift in the allocation of jurisdictional responsibility lies at the heart of § 410(c)'s consultation requirement.


69
The Joint Board was aware that replacing the existing high-cost support system will affect the jurisdictional separations rules. This is shown by the fact, for instance, that the Joint Board made a detailed discussion of the current jurisdictional separations rules, acknowledging that they "currently assign 25 percent of each LEC's loop costs to the interstate jurisdiction." See First Recommended Decision ¶ 188.


70
In discussing the comments submitted by affected parties, the Joint Board recognized that the jurisdictional separations rules are part of the old regime of "embedded" or "historical" costs. See id. ¶ 207. Thus, the Joint Board does seem to recognize that the jurisdictional separations rules are part of the old "embedded cost"system and were developed in the context of allocating the actual costs of developing the local and long-distance networks. By recommending replacing the historical cost system with a forward-looking "most efficient" cost model, the Joint Board must have considered that the jurisdictional separations rules no longer would apply in the same way. Although no detailed discussion appears in the First Recommended Decision, the Joint Board's recognition that the jurisdictional separations rules would be affected by adopting a new cost model fulfills § 410(c)'s consultation requirement.28


71
2. Eligibility Requirements for Carriers Seeking Universal Service Support.


72
The states and intervenor Southwestern Bell ("SBC") challenge the FCC's reading of the Act's provisions governing eligibility requirements for carriers seeking universal service support. In general, they question the agency's interpretation of § 214(e) as too narrow and restrictive of the ability of state commissions to set their own criteria and exercise their own discretion over a carrier's eligibility.


73
a. Limiting the Criteria That State Commissions May Consider When Assessing a Carrier's Eligibility.


74
Section 214(e) governs the designation of carriers eligible to receive federal universal service support. Section 214(e)(1)(A) and (B) set out the eligibility requirements, and § 214(e)(2)29 governs the designation of eligible carriers by state commissions.


75
In the Order, the FCC interpreted § 214(e)(2) in this way. With limited exceptions for rural areas, a state commission has no discretion when assessing a carrier's eligibility for federal support. If a carrier satisfies the terms of § 214(e)(1), a state commission must designate it as eligible. Thus, the FCC ruled that a state commission may not impose additional eligibility requirements on a carrier seeking universal service support in non-rural service areas. See Order ¶ 135. The agency does permit the states to impose service quality obligations on local carriers if those obligations are unrelated to a carrier's eligibility to receive federal universal service support. According to the FCC, this interpretation "gives effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress." See Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-43.


76
The states and SBC offer two lines of attack. First, they argue that the plain language of § 214(e)(2) does not support the FCC's blanket prohibition on additional state eligibility requirements. Second, they say that the FCC exceeded its jurisdictional authority, in violation of 47 U.S.C. § 152(b), by purporting to interfere with the states' regulation of intrastate service. Because we conclude that the agencyerred in prohibiting the states from imposing additional eligibility requirements, we do not reach the states' jurisdictional challenges.


77
On the plain language front, the states argue that § 214(e)(2) does not unambiguously prohibit them from regulating carriers receiving federal universal support. Specifically, they contend that Congress did not mean to prohibit the states from imposing service quality standards on eligible carriers. According to the states, the language on which the FCC relies--"[a] State Commission shall upon its own motion or upon request designate a common carrier that meets the requirements of paragraph (1) as an eligible telecommunications carrier"--does not expressly circumscribe state authority to add additional eligibility requirements.


78
The agency's best hope for express authority for its action rests on the statute's use of the word "shall" in § 214(e)(2). Generally speaking, courts have read "shall" as a more direct statutory command than words such as "should" and "may."30 Though we agree that the use of the word "shall" indicates a congressional command, nothing in the statute indicates that this command prohibits states from imposing their own eligibility requirements. Instead, we read § 214(e)(2) as addressing how many carriers a state may designate for a given service area, and not how much discretion a state commission retains to impose eligibility standards.


79
The first sentence requires state commissions to designate at least one common carrier as eligible, but that carrier must still meet the eligibility requirements in § 214(e)(1). The second sentence then confers discretion on the states to designate more than one carrier in rural areas, while requiring them to designate eligible carriers in non-rural areas consistent with the "public interest" requirement. Nothing in the statute, under this reading of the plain language, speaks at all to whether the FCC may prevent state commissions from imposing additional criteria on eligible carriers.31


80
Thus, the FCC erred in prohibiting the states from imposing additional eligibility requirements on carriers otherwise eligible to receive federal universal service support. The plain language of the statute speaks to the question of how many carriers a state commission may designate, but nothing in the subsection prohibits the states from imposing their own eligibility requirements.32 This reading makes sense in light of the states' historical role in ensuring service quality standards for local service. Therefore, we reverse that portion of the Order prohibiting the states from imposing any additional requirements when designating carriers as eligible for federal universal service support.


81
b. The Terms of Section 214(e)(5) Governing the Definition of Service Areas.


82
In their initial brief, the states argued that the FCC had impermissibly encroached on their exclusive authority todesignate service areas for universal service support. The FCC, however, pointed out that ¶ 185 of the Order had only encouraged the states to make certain decisions33 when designating service areas. The agency explicitly denies that the paragraph requires the states to follow its "encouragements." Thus, it appears that the states misinterpreted the FCC's intentions in ¶ 185 and that there is no issue left for us to address.


83
The states, however, continue to contest one aspect of the Order regarding the definition of service areas. The FCC maintains that it may establish a different definition of service areas for rural carriers, with the agreement of the states, without having to submit such a new definition first to the Joint Board. The states argue that the plain language of § 214(e)(5) allows the agency to act only "after taking into account recommendations of [the Joint Board] . . . ."


84
The FCC has two procedural responses and one substantive defense. Because we agree with the FCC that the states have no standing, we do not reach the FCC's other defenses.


85
The agency argues that the states have no standing to challenge its ruling, because the states have failed to show any harm.34  After all, as the FCC points out, it must still garner the approval of each respective state before a rural service area can be redefined. The states argue that they are harmed because the state members of the Joint Board are denied a chance to participate in the decisionmaking process, so the states are less able to coordinate with each other. They further contend that bypassing the Joint Board denied the states any meaningful participation in revising service area definitions for rural territories.


86
This claim is weak, because the states' independent ability to veto particular service areas seems to provide them with a substantial amount of "meaningful participation." This is unlike the situation in the cases the states rely on, in that the states here are not challenging a federal preemption order that threatens their sovereign authority.  See California v. FCC, 75 F.3d 1350, 1361 (9th Cir. 1996). Therefore, the states lack standing to challenge this portion of the Order.


87
c. Declining To Require Eligible Carriers To Offer Supported Services on an Unbundled Basis.


88
GTE argues that the FCC's failure to require carriers to "unbundle" their offerings when receiving universal service support violates the congressional intent expressed in § 214(e)(1) under Chevron step-one. "Bundling" refers to a carrier's practice of offering different services together as one package. For instance, a carrier might offer basic phone service as part of a package that includes call-waiting and voicemail.


89
GTE fears that a new carrier could "cherry pick" high-profit customers by offering only bundled local telephone service packages. Because the intended beneficiaries of universal service are, by definition, less able to afford even basic service, offering expensive bundled packages will allow new carriers to steal wealthier, low-cost customers while leaving ILEC's such as GTE to provide service to everyone else. GTE reasons that Congress, by requiring carriers receiving federal universal service support to advertise the availability of itssupported services, intended to require new carriers to participate in universal service--an intent that would be thwarted by Allowing the new carriers to offer bundled services.


90
The FCC responds that the plain language of the statute is satisfied as long as a carrier offers "services that are supported by Federal universal service mechanisms." 47 U.S.C. 214(e)(1)(A). Except for the advertising requirement, the statute makes no mention of "bundling" or other eligibility criteria. In fact, the FCC argues that because of the exclusive grant of eligibility authority conferred on the states by § 214(e)(2), it cannot impose additional eligibility criteria. Because the statute is silent on the question of bundling, and because the statute seems to prohibit further eligibility criteria, the agency asks us to give deference to its interpretation of § 214(e) under Chevron step-two.


91
We agree that the statute's plain language does not reveal Congress's unambiguous intent. It is not evident, however, that the FCC's interpretation of the statute meets even the minimum level of reasonability required in step-two review.


92
Section 214(e)(1) plainly requires carriers receiving universal service support to offer such supported services to as many customers as possible. Thus, an eligible carrier must offer such services "throughout the service area" and "advertise the availability of such services." This requirement makes sense in light of the new universal service program's goal of maintaining affordable service in a competitive local market. Allowing bundling, however, would completely undermine the goal of the first two requirements, because a carrier could qualify for universal service support by simply offering and then advertising expensive, bundled services to low-income customers who cannot afford it.


93
The FCC suggests that GTE's problems stem not from bundling but from state-imposed "carrier of last resort" ("COLR") requirements, which prohibit ILEC's such as GTE from disconnecting low-profit consumers and leave ILEC's vulnerable to outside competition. But the elimination of COLR requirements would only further undermine the goal of making basic services available to low income consumers and those in "rural, insular, and high cost areas." See 47 U.S.C. § 254(b)(3). This again would violate the express intent of the universal service program. Without a better explanation for its unreasonable interpretation, we would be inclined to find the FCC's implementation "arbitrary and capricious and manifestly contrary to the statute." See Chevron, 467 U.S. at 844.


94
Fortunately, the agency also has explained that "only an eligible carrier that succeeds in attracting and/or maintaining a customer base to whom it provides universal service will receive universal service support." Order ¶ 138. Therefore, it reasons that if offering only bundled services would price low-income customers out of the market, the carrier offering bundled services would eventually lose universal service support. Thus, the FCC can avoid the problem of providing universal service support to carriers that do not serve high-cost customers for which the support is intended. This explanation supports the FCC's claim that its decision to allow bundling is reasonable under Chevron step-two review.


95
Though the decision is a close one, we conclude that the FCC's refusal to require eligible carriers to provide unbundled services is neither "arbitrary, capricious," nor "manifestly contrary to the statute." See Chevron, 467 U.S. at 844. Because the agency will prevent companies from using bundling to receive federal support while avoiding high-cost customers, we do not find its interpretation "so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise." Motor Vehicle Mfrs.' Ass'n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S.29, 43 (1983).


96
3. Authority To Prohibit Carriers from Disconnecting Local Service to Low-income Consumers Who Fail To Pay Toll Charges.


97
Bell Atlantic and the states challenge the FCC's adoption of a regulation35 prohibiting carriers receiving universal service support from disconnecting Lifeline services36 from low-income consumers who have failed to pay toll charges. See Order ¶ 390. The petitioners charge that the "no disconnect" rule exceeds the agency's jurisdictional authority under § 2(b) of the 1934 Act,37 which prohibits FCC regulation of intrastate telecommunications service. Because the plain language of the statute expresses Congress's unambiguous intent, we review the agency's interpretation under Chevron step-one.


98
The agency has three responses. First, it argues that § 2(b) does not apply where Congress has given the FCC an "unambiguous or straightforward" grant of authority. See Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 476 U.S. at 377. The agency argues that Congress granted such express authority in § 254(b)(3), which directs the FCC to base its policies on the principle that "low-income consumers and those in rural, insular, and high cost areas, should have access to telecommunications and information services . . . ."


99
As we have discussed, § 254(b) identifies seven principles the FCC should consider in developing its policies; it hardly constitutes a series of specific statutory commands. Indeed, we have avoided relying on the aspirational language in § 254(b) to bind the FCC to adopt certain cost methodologies for calculating universal service support.38


100
Just as we declined to read § 254(b) as an inexorable statutory command against the FCC, we decline to read it as a grant of plenary power overriding other portions of the Act. The agency has no "unambiguous or straightforward" grant of authority to override the limits set by § 2(b), and, accordingly, it has no jurisdiction to adopt the "no disconnect" rule on the basis of the vague, general language of § 254(b)(3).39


101
Second, the FCC contends that the petitioners' jurisdictional challenge is inapposite because the "no disconnect" rule does not purport to regulate intrastate service, but merely prevents the disconnection of interstate service (and, as a consequence, of intrastate service) for failure to pay toll charges.40 As Bell Atlanticrightly responds, however, the "no disconnect" rule is a "regulation," because it dictates the circumstances under which local service must be maintained. Therefore, the FCC, by issuing the rule, has acted "with respect to" and "in connection with" interstate service within the meaning of § 2(b).


102
The FCC points out that even if the "no disconnect" rule is a "regulation" within the meaning of § 2(b), courts have sustained agency jurisdiction over similar rules under the "impossibility" exception. In North Carolina Utils. Comm'n v. FCC, 552 F.2d 1036 (4th Cir. 1977), the court upheld FCC regulations permitting local subscribers to connect their telephones to the local loop to make interstate calls. North Carolina previously had required subscribers to use leased telephones and argued that § 2(b) prevented FCC intervention because the vast majority of these calls were intrastate. The court rejected this argument, holding that "the FCC has jurisdiction to prescribe the conditions under which terminal equipment may be interconnected with the interstate telephone line network." Id. at 1048.


103
Essentially, the FCC asks us to find that the "no disconnect" rule, aimed at regulating interstate service, is impossible to separate from intrastate service. In similar cases, the District of Columbia Circuit has permitted the FCC to intervene in relatively localized service issues41 and has developed a useful framework for analyzing what the petitioners refer to as the "impossibility" exception to § 2(b). See Public Serv. Comm'n v. FCC ("Maryland PSC"), 909 F.2d 1510, 1515 (D.C. Cir. 1990).


104
To permit the FCC to preempt state regulation of whether to cut off low-income subscribers, that circuit requires the agency to show that "(1) the matter to be regulated has both interstate and intrastate aspects; (2) FCC preemption is necessary to protect a valid federal regulatory objective; and (3) state regulation would negate the exercise by the FCC of its own lawful authority because regulation of the interstate aspects of the matter cannot be unbundled from regulation of intrastate aspects." Maryland PSC, 909 F.2d at 1515 (internal quotations and citations omitted). This framework creates a properly narrow exception to § 2(b) that allows the FCC to preempt state regulation only when it has shown it cannot carry out its authorized federal objectives without encroaching on state autonomy.


105
Applying this framework to the "no disconnect" rule, we agree with Bell Atlantic that the FCC has failed to show why allowing the states to control disconnections from local service would "negate the exercise of the FCC's lawful authority . . . ." As Bell Atlantic points out, the agency offered only a brief explanation of what lawfully authorized federal objectives are being served by the "no disconnect" rule and why it is necessary to preempt local authority to achieve these objectives.


106
In the Order, the FCC simply states that the "no disconnect" rule advances its goal of increasing subscribership and that it will improve the competitiveness of the market for billing and collection of toll charges. See Order ¶¶ 390-391. But the agency has not adequately explained, in either its brief or its Order, why these goals would be "negated" by allowing the states to control disconnection of local subscribers. In contrast to what occurred in Maryland PSC, where the court allowed the FCC to assert jurisdiction to prevent ILEC's from shifting local costs to interstate consumers, the FCC has offered no similar explanation of how protecting interstate service requires imposition of a "no disconnect" rule. Therefore, we declineto allow the agency to assert jurisdiction over the disconnection of local service based on the impossibility exception.


107
Finally, the FCC argues that in the wake of Iowa Utilities, it has jurisdiction over all areas, including intrastate matters, to which the Act applies. In Iowa Utilities, the Court rejected jurisdictional challenges to the portions of the FCC's Local Competition Order implementing §§ 251 and 252 of the Act, which govern the interconnection of new local service carriers with the ILEC's and establish procedures for negotiating, arbitrating, and approving any interconnection agreements. As in the instant case, petitioners challenged the FCC's jurisdiction to implement the Act, arguing that much of the authority to enforce the provisions (§§ 251 and 252) remain with the state commissions by virtue of § 2(b).  Specifically, they contended that the Act gives the FCC jurisdiction over intrastate matters only when the statute explicitly applies to intrastate services and specifically confers agency jurisdiction over intrastate services.


108
The Court brushed aside these attempts to raise the § 2(b) jurisdictional fence and squarely held that "§ 201(b)42 explicitly gives the FCC jurisdiction to make rules governing matters to which the 1996 Act applies." Iowa Utilities, 119 S. Ct. at 730. Though § 2(b)'s language stating that "nothing in this Act shall be construed to apply or to give the Commission jurisdiction" implies that FCC jurisdiction does not always follow where the Act applies, the Court held that "the term 'apply' limits the substantive reach of the statute . . . and the phrase 'or Commission jurisdiction' limits . . . the FCC's ancillary jurisdiction." Id. at 731. Relying on this holding, the FCC argues that because § 254 applies to intrastate as well as interstate matters, § 201(b) confers the necessary jurisdiction to implement the "no disconnect" rule.


109
Though the Court's broad language seems to support the FCC's position, Bell Atlantic finds comfort in the Court's preservation of Louisiana PSC. In reconciling its holding with Louisiana PSC, the Court held that the FCC must show that the meaning of a statutory provision applies to intrastate matters in an "unambiguous and straightforward" manner as "to override the command of § 2(b)." Iowa Utilities, 119 S. Ct. at 731 (quoting Louisiana PSC, 476 U.S. at 377). If the agency fails in this initial task, it cannot use its normally broad regulatory authority to assert what is now only ancillary jurisdiction because of the still-intact jurisdictional fence created by § 2(b). See id. Therefore, after Iowa Utilities, § 2(b) still serves as (1) a rule of statutory construction43 requiring the FCC to find unambiguous statutory authority applying to intrastate matters and (2) a jurisdictional barrier restricting the agency from using its plenary authority to assert ancillary jurisdiction by "taking intrastate action solely because it further[s] an interstate goal." See Iowa Utilities, 119 S. Ct. at 731 (citing Louisiana PSC, 476 U.S. at 374).


110
The question is whether § 254 does indeed "apply" to intrastate matters in a sufficiently "unambiguous" manner. Without such a finding, Iowa Utilities flatly holds that the FCC cannot use its plenary authority to assert ancillary jurisdiction.


111
Unfortunately, Iowa Utilities provides little guidance for resolving the question whether § 254 applies to intrastate services. For the Supreme Court, "the question . . . is not whether the Federal Governmenthas taken the regulation of local telecommunications competition away from the States. With regard to the matters addressed by the 1996 Act, it unquestionably has." Iowa Utilities, 119 S. Ct. at 730 n.6. The Court did not further explain why it felt §§ 251 and 252 "unquestionably" applied to intrastate matters.


112
The FCC bases its contention that § 254 plainly applies to intrastate as well as interstate matters on § 254(b)(3),(c), and (j). According to the agency, § 254(b)(3) applies to intrastate service by stating that "low income consumers . . . should have access to telecommunications and information services, including interexchange services and advanced telecommunications and information services."


113
The use of the word "including," the FCC argues, indicates that the object of § 254 is to provide access to more than just interexchange services. Furthermore, § 254(c) instructs the agency to consider, in the process of establishing what constitutes universal service, whether such services "have . . . been subscribed to by a substantial majority of residential customers."  Finally, § 254(j) specifically preserves the Lifeline Assistance program, which has always provided subsidies for both intrastate and interstate services.


114
We have already discussed our reluctance to rely on the aspirational language of § 254(b).44 Moreover, the phrase "including interexchange carriers" cannot be said unambiguously to mean that § 254 applies to local services, and § 254(c)'s mention of a "majority of residential customers" is far from straightforward. Neither is there much guidance from § 254(j), which specifically protects the Lifeline Assistance program from being affected by any other part of § 254 but does not in any way clarify to what degree § 254 applies to intrastate universal service.


115
Instead, there is substantial support in the statute for a dual regulatory structure in the administration of the universal service program. Section 254(d) specifically instructs interstate carriers to contribute to the FCC's universal service mechanisms, while § 254(f) instructs intrastate carriers to contribute to the states' individual universal service mechanisms. This section contains the only discussion of intrastate universal service mechanisms and directs intrastate carriers to report to the states rather than to the FCC.


116
In light of Iowa Utilities and Louisiana PSC, therefore, we conclude that, "while it is, no doubt, possible to find some support in the broad language of the section for [the FCC's] position, we do not find the meaning of the section so unambiguous or straightforward as to override the command of § 152(b)." Louisiana PSC, 476 U.S. at 377. Unlike §§ 251 and 252, which were solely concerned with intrastate issues (i.e., interconnection of new entrants into the local telephone market), § 254 applies to both interstate and intrastate services. It does so, however, only to the extent that it gives exclusive authority over intrastate contributions to the state commissions. We find it incongruous to use this explicit limitation on FCC authority as the hook to provide it with jurisdiction.


117
Therefore, the FCC exceeded its jurisdiction when it imposed the "no disconnect" rule. Because there is no express grant of statutory authority, a proper showing of "impossibility," or a persuasive explanation of how § 254 applies to intrastate service, we reverse, for want of agency jurisdiction, those portions of the Order implementing the "no disconnect" rule.


118
4. Recovery of Universal Service Contributions.


119
a. Requiring Incumbents To Recover Contributions Through Access Charges.


120
GTE and the FCC again wrangle over the meaning of "explicit" in theirdispute regarding the rule requiring most ILEC's to recover their universal service contributions through access charges. GTE contends that the rule violates § 254(e)'s command that any support for universal service be "explicit," because recovering contributions through increased access charges is a form of implicit subsidy.


121
GTE argues that the rule unfairly disadvantages ILEC's because, unlike their potential new competitors, they cannot recover their universal service contributions through explicit charges on their end-users, but, instead, are required by the FCC to increase their access charges on long-distance service providers. Though they do not necessarily lose out in terms of amounts recovered, GTE fears that this recovery method will put them at a competitive disadvantage because, instead of than seeing the costs of universal service on his bill as an explicit surcharge, an ILEC consumer will pay for the costs of universal service through higher rates.


122
The FCC advances a different understanding of "explicit." "Regardless of how carriers recover their contributions, the FCC's universal service system 'satisfies the statutory requirement that support be explicit' by requiring each carrier to contribute a specific percentage of its end user revenues" (quoting Order ¶ 854). As long as carriers know exactly how much they are contributing to the support mechanisms, the subsidies are explicit.


123
The statute provides little guidance on whether "explicit" means "explicit to the consumer" (as urged by GTE) or "explicit to the carrier" (as urged by the FCC). The statute does state, however, that all universal service support should be "explicit." We read "explicit" to mean the opposite of "implicit." See § 254(e).


124
By forcing GTE to recover its universal service contributions from its access charges, the FCC's interpretation maintains an implicit subsidy for ILEC's such as GTE. In fact, requiring carriers to recover their contributions from access charges on interstate calls shifts the costs of intrastate universal service to the interstate jurisdiction. These are precisely the sorts of implicit subsidies currently used by the FCC in its DAM weighting program. See Order ¶ 212 (discussing rules that permit small LEC's to recover costs for intrastate services from interstate access charges).


125
We are convinced that the plain language of § 254(e) does not permit the FCC to maintain any implicit subsidies for universal service support. Therefore, we will not afford the FCC any Chevron step-two deference in light of this unambiguous Congressional intent. Because the agency continues to require implicit subsidies for ILEC's in violation of a plain, direct statutory command, we reverse its decision to require ILEC's to recover universal service contributions from their interstate access charges.


126
b. Requiring Interstate Carriers To Reduce Interstate Access Charges by the Amount of Federal High-cost Support They Receive Under the New Universal Service System.


127
The states contest an aspect of the Order's effect on interstate access charges, arguing that the requirement that carriers reduce their interstate access charges by the amount of direct federal high-cost support they receive will leave insufficient funds for intrastate universal service. The states make two unconvincing plain-language arguments. First, they point to § 254(b)(5)'s language about "specific, predictable and sufficient" mechanisms to "preserve and advance universal service." As we have observed, § 254(b) identifies a set of principles and does not lay out any specific commands for the FCC. Even § 254(e), which is framed as a direct, statutory command, is ambiguous as to what constitutes "sufficient" support. Therefore, we do not consider the language an expression of Congress's "unambiguous intent" allowing Chevron step-onereview, and we review its interpretation for reasonability under Chevron step-two.


128
The states argue that § 254(e) does not permit the application of federal universal service funds for the interstate jurisdiction. In essence, they seek to preserve state universal service support by reading the statute to require all high-cost support to remain intrastate. Though this might make compelling policy, nothing in the plain language of § 254(e)45 unequivocally establishes the states' right to all of the federal universal support funds. The statutory language is at best ambiguous as to Congress's intent, which, under Chevron step-two, leaves it to the FCC's reasonable interpretation.


129
The FCC has offered good reason to believe that its new explicit support through direct subsidies will replace the amounts lost through the reduction of access charges. See Report to Congress ¶ 230. To be sure, the states and intervenor NASUCA46 make a plausible argument that ILEC's will receive less under the new plan than they did through implicit subsidies. As we have determined, however, because the FCC has offered reasonable explanations of why it thinks the funds will still be "sufficient" to support high-cost areas, we defer to the agency's judgment of what is "sufficient."


130
Under the agency's new universal service plan, it is possible that the states will receive less support for intrastate universal service costs than they did under the old plan. While this may seem unfair as a matter of policy, the states have failed to show that the FCC's interpretation, which may possibly result in a reduction of their level of support, is "arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute." Chevron, 467 U.S. at 844.


131
5. Contributions.


132
a. Requiring CMRS Carriers To Contribute to the Federal Universal Service Fund.47


133
Celpage Inc., a paging carrier, and intervenors representing a number of wireless telecommunications companies (referred to in general as commercial mobile radio service or "CMRS" providers), challenge the FCC's decision to subject them to the universal service support scheme. Celpage raises a number of constitutional and statutory challenges to the decision to require their contributions to the universal service fund. Specifically, Celpage attacks the agency's universal service contribution requirement as an unconstitutional tax, a violation of equal protection, and an uncompensated taking. Additionally, Celpage charges that the FCC's action violates § 254's plain language, is arbitrary and capricious, and does not meet the agency's own principle of competitive neutrality.


134
i. Constitutional Challenges.


135
(a). Unconstitutional Tax.


136
There are two ways in which the universal service contribution requirement for paging carriers could constitute an unconstitutional tax. First, the FCC's application of the universal service requirement to paging carriers such as Celpage might be an unconstitutional delegation of Congress's exclusive taxing power under the Taxing Clause.48 Alternatively, becausethe Act originated in the Senate,49 its requirement of universal service contributions from paging carriers might violate the Origination Clause's requirement that all "[b]ills for raising [r]evenue" originate in the House of Representatives"50


137
Despite their similarities, the Taxing Clause and Origination Clause challenges to the universal service contribution system represent separate lines of analysis.51 In its initial brief, however, Celpage raises only the Origination Clause challenge and does not raise a Taxing Clause claim until its reply brief. Therefore, we will not consider it,52 and we focus our efforts on Celpage's claim that the universal service contribution requirement, as applied to paging carriers, is a violation of the Origination Clause.53


138
Unfortunately for Celpage, its Origination Clause claim cannot survive United States v. Munoz-Flores, 495 U.S. 385, 398 (1990). There, the Court refused to find that a special assessment on certain federal criminals for a "crime victim's" fund is a tax, because "a statute that creates a particular governmental program and that raises revenue to support that program . . . is not a 'Bil[l] for raising Revenue' within the meaning of the Origination Clause." Id.


139
Celpage points out that the Congressional Budget Office has treated universal service fund contributions as federal revenues. But how the government classifies a program for accounting purposes does not resolve whether the funds are used for a specific program or for general revenues. Indeed, the Court in Munoz-Flores upheld the special assessment even though the excess money collected was deposited in the Treasury. Instead of looking at accounting designations, Munoz-Flores teaches us (1) to determine whether the funds are "part of a particular program to provide money for that program . . . ." and (2) to establish a connection between the payors and the beneficiaries. Munoz-Flores, 495 U.S. at 399, 400 n.7.


140
With one exception,54 universal service contributions are part of a particular programsupporting the expansion of, and increased access to, the public institutional telecommunications network. See Order ¶ 8. Each paging carrier directly benefits from a larger and larger network and, with that in mind, Congress designed the universal service scheme to exact payments from those companies benefiting from the provision of universal service.55 This design prevents the sums being used to support the universal service program from being classified as "revenue" within the meaning of the Origination Clause.


141
Paging carriers are uniquely dependent on a widespread telecommunications network for the maintenance and expansion of their business. See Order ¶ 82. As in Munoz-Flores, the challenged assessment targets a group "to which some part of the expenses" of sustaining the universal service program "can fairly be attributed." See Munoz-Flores, 495 U.S. at 400 n.7. Therefore, the application of the universal service contribution requirement to paging carriers does not transform the Act into a "bill for raising revenue" in violation of the Origination Clause.56


142
(b). Equal Protection.


143
To invalidate the FCC's actions on equal protection grounds, we must find that there is no "basis for the action that bears a debatably rational relationship to a conceivable legitimate governmental end." See Reid v. Rolling Fork Pub. Util. Dist., 979 F.2d 1084, 1087 (5th Cir. 1992). This is a tough burden, and Celpage does not come close. Celpage argues there can be no rational reason to include paging carriers in the universal service contribution system, because its contributions will support services that do not benefit Celpage. But the FCC has offered a reasonable proposition: Paging carriers such as Celpage benefit from a larger and more universal public network system, because it increases the number of potential locations for paging use. Even if this proposition is wrong, as Celpage suggests, it certainly meets the very low "debatably rational" test.57


144
(c). Taking.


145
Celpage advances an unconvincing takings claim. As an initial matter, a takings claim is not ripe until a claimant has unsuccessfully sought compensation from the state.58 Celpage does not allege that it has used any of the FCC's administrative procedures to petition for compensation or that such procedures are so inadequate as to make resort to these procedures futile. "To violate the [takings] clause, the state must not only take someone's property but also deny himcompensation." Samaad v. City of Dallas, 940 F.2d 925, 934 (5th Cir. 1991).


146
As we did in the case of GTE's challenge to the forward-looking cost methodology, we reject Celpage's takings claim as not ripe for judicial review.59


147
ii. Other Challenges.


148
Celpage attacks the FCC's interpretation of the "equitable and nondiscriminatory" language in § 254(b)(4). To be truly equitable, Celpage asserts, the agency should not treat all carriers in the same way for purposes of the universal service contribution system. Additionally, Celpage accuses the agency of failing to consider evidence of congressional intent, the record evidence, and other evidence of why paging carriers should not be included in the universal service contribution system.


149
The FCC has successfully dispensed with the plain language challenge. First, as we have explained, the "equitable and nondiscriminatory" language in § 254(b) acts as only one of seven guiding principles for FCC rulemaking. See supra part III.A.1.a.i. That subsection also instructs the agency that "all providers of telecommunications services should make an equitable and nondiscriminatory contribution" to universal service. (Emphasis added.) The language of § 254(b) directs us to give the FCC, in addition to the usual Chevron deference, discretion here to fashion a policy that is guided by both of these principles.


150
Celpage also challenges the FCC's interpretation as arbitrary and capricious under the APA because it is not supported by the record, and the agency has provided no reason why its decision should be made in the face of contrary record evidence. Specifically, Celpage says that the FCC failed to consider ex parte statements by legislators during the rulemaking proceedings urging it to exclude CMRS carriers from the universal service contribution system. Additionally, Celpage points to evidence in the record supporting its position and claims the FCC failed to consider it.


151
To achieve reversal under the APA's arbitrary and capricious standard, Celpage must show that the FCC failed to "articulate[] a rational relationship between the facts found and the choice made . . . ." Harris, 19 F.3d at 1096. A reviewing court tries "to determine whether the decision was based on a consideration of relevant factors . . . ." Louisiana v. Verity, 853 F.2d 322, 327 (5th Cir. 1988).


152
The record does not show that the FCC failed to consider the counter-arguments proffered by the CMRS providers and their allies. The agency did take note of letters from Congress on behalf of CMRS providers and from other legislators taking the opposite position. See Report to Congress ¶ 129 & n.301. Moreover, the letters on both sides have limited persuasiveness, because they are simply "post-passage remarks" that "'represent only the personal views of these legislators'" and "cannot serve to the change the legislative intent of Congress expressed before the Act's passage." Regional Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U.S. 102, 132 (1974) (quoting National Woodwork Mfrs. Ass'n v. NLRB, 386 U.S. 612, 639 n.34 (1967)).


153
The FCC offered a reasonable justification for including CMRS providers--this time relying on statutory language, the Joint Board recommendation, and the reasonable view that paging carriers do receive benefits from the universal service system. Accordingly, the agency's interpretation may not fairly be described as "arbitrary and capricious" under the APA.60


154
iii. Implementing Universal Service Assessment Requirements.


155
Celpage and the CMRS Providers challenge the FCC's rules and procedures for assessing contributions in the form of the Universal Service Worksheet. Specifically, Celpage attacks the worksheet for failing to distinguish between billed revenues and collected revenues for purposes of calculating universal service contributions. The CMRS Providers complain that the FCC's failure to provide guidance on how to adjust for the different nature of CMRS revenues makes the assessment system unconstitutionally vague.


156
We do not reach the vagueness argument, because the FCC persuasively responds that these challenges are not yet ripe for judicial review, for the reason that the agency has made a "tentative decision."61 Similar attacks on the Worksheet are currently pending before the agency as petitions for reconsideration.62 Moreover, recognizing the difficulties that the Worksheet raises, the FCC has already granted CMRS providers interim relief by allowing them to provide good-faith estimates of the figures required by the Worksheet.


157
Thus, the agency properly asks us to defer judicial review of its tentative decision until all administrative remedies are exhausted. In analogous situations, courts have postponed review "until relevant agency proceedings have been concluded [to] permit[] an administrative agency to develop a factual record, to apply its expertise to the record, and to avoid piecemeal appeals." See Telecommunications Research & Action Ctr. v. FCC, 750 F.2d 70, 79 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (internal citations omitted).


158
iv. States' Collection of Universal Service Assessment from CMRS Carriers.


159
Celpage and the CMRS Providers make a convincing challenge in contesting the FCC's decision to permit states to impose universal service contribution requirements on CMRS providers. They argue that the plain language of 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(3)(A) specifically preempts states from doing so. Additionally, the CMRS Providers contend that § 254(f)'s language, relied on by the FCC, does not reach CMRS providers, because they are interstate carriers.


160
(a) Plain Language of § 332(c)(3)(A).


161
Celpage and the CMRS Providers argue that in § 332(c)(3)(A), "Congress has spoken to the precise question at issue," the ability of states to assess CMRS providers for universal service contributions. See Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842. Therefore, they argue that the FCC's interpretation deserves no deference. The plain language of § 332(c)(3)(A) does seem to apply to the issue at hand:


162
Notwithstanding sections 152(b) and 221(b) of this title, no State or local government shall have any authority to           regulate the entry of or the rates charged by any commercial mobile service or any private mobile service, except that this paragraph shall not prohibit a State from regulating the other terms and conditions of commercial mobile         services. Nothing in this subparagraph shall exempt providers of commercial mobile services (where such services        are a substitute for land line telephone exchange service for a substantial portion of the communications within such State) from requirements imposed by a State commission on all providers of telecommunications services          necessary to ensure the universal availability of telecommunications service at affordable rates.


163
Before we discuss the differing interpretations of the statute, we must decide on the proper standard of review. The Tenth Circuit recently reviewed the FCC's interpretation of this section under the second step of Chevron, because the statute does not expressly state how we should read § 332(c)(3)(A) in relation to § 254(f). See Sprint, 149 F.3d at 1061. This standard of review is inappropriate, however, because it would allow the FCC to receive Chevron deference in almost every situation in which two sections of a statute must be read together. Indeed, the Act does contain a specific rule of statutory construction in § 601(c)(1), reprinted in 47 U.S.C. § 152 (Addendum A-1): "This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall not be construed to modify, impair or supersede Federal, State or local law unless expressly provided in such Act or Amendments."


164
Thus, we disagree with the Sprint court that the lack of a specific provision discussing the relation between §§ 332(c)(3)(A) and 254(f) automatically triggers Chevron deference. To the contrary, § 601(c)(1) gives us explicit instruction to read § 254(f) ("federal law") as not conflicting with § 332(c)(3)(A). Therefore, we conduct a Chevron step-one review and try to search out the statute's plain meaning.


165
Celpage and the CMRS Providers offer this "plain common sense" reading: Assessments for universal service by state commissions constitute regulation of rates or entry for purposes of the statute. The first sentence of this subsection prohibits the states from regulating rates or entry, and therefore prohibits universal service assessments, relating to CMRS providers. The second sentence explains that states may impose universal service requirements "where such services are a substitute for land line telephone exchange service . . . ." This plain language, Celpage and the CMRS Providers argue, expressly prohibits states from requiring universal service contributions from CMRS providers without first making a finding that the CMRS services in question are a substitute for landline telephone service.


166
The FCC points to plain language that requires it to make "[e]very . . . carrier that provides intrastate telecommunications service" contribute to the universal service programs as determined by the states. See 47 U.S.C. § 254(f). It then contends that the provisions of § 332(c)(3)(A) should not be read to trump the express commands of § 254(f).


167
The FCC finds support for its reading in the second clause of the first sentence of § 332(c)(3)(A). First, it concludes that requiring universal service contributions is neither rate nor entry regulation. SeeFourth Reconsideration Order ¶ 301. It then notes that this clause says that a state is not prohibited from regulating "other terms and conditions of commercial mobile services." Based on this clause alone, the FCC argues, the states retain the ability to compel universal service contributions as long as it does not constitute regulation of rates or entry. The second sentence simply clarifies that states can also regulate "rates and entry" if they make a finding that CMRS providers are substituting for landline service.


168
The Sprint court adopted this reading of § 332(c)(3)(A) and added another argument for the FCC's position. See Sprint, 149 F.3d at 1061. The second sentence's introductory language, "nothing in this subparagraph . . .," limits the reach of the landline substitution requirement to § 332(c)(3)(A). Therefore, the landline substitution requirement "simply is not relevant to § 254(f)." Id.


169
The petitioners argue that the FCC's reading violates the maxim of statutory construction that all language of a statute must be given effect.63 According to the petitioners, if we read the clause "other terms and conditions" to enable states to impose universal service requirements, then the entire second sentence would be redundant. There would be no reason to create a statutory requirement for when states may impose conditions for universal service if the "other terms and conditions" clause already allows states to impose universal service requirements on CMRS providers.


170
But the FCC persuasively responds that, under its reading, the second sentence clarifies the ability of states to regulate rates and entry in the name of universal service, while the "other terms and conditions" clause opens the door to all other universal service regulation. Thus, we do not conclude, as the petitioners imply we should, that requiring universal service contributions necessarily constitutes the regulation of rates and entry.64 Thus, under the FCC's reading, the states may generally regulate CMRS providers as they please, but they may regulate the rates and entry of CMRS providers only when they make a finding of substitutability.


171
We disagree with the CMRS Providers' further argument that even this reading, adopted in Cellular Telecomms. Indus. Ass'n v. FCC, 168 F.3d 1332 (D.C. Cir. 1999),65 would render the second sentence redundant because the third sentence of the subsection specifically lays out the procedures under which a state can petition for the right to regulate CMRS rates. The FCC's reading would still permit the following understanding of the statute: States (1) in general can never regulate rates and entry requirements for CMRS providers; (2) are free to regulate all other terms and conditions of CMRS service; (3) may regulate CMRS rates and entry requirements when they have made a substitutability finding in connection with universal service programs; and (4) may also regulate CMRS rates if they petition the FCC and meet certain statutory requirements, including either substitutability or unjust market rates. None of the provisions would have to be read as inoperative or redundant.


172
Additionally, this reading would avoid conflict with § 254(f), which requires that "every telecommunications carrier" contribute to the universal service fund. Thisrendition of § 332(c)(3)(A) allows the FCC to give effect to the plain language of § 254(f) while not violating § 601(c)'s directive to construe the Act in ways that do not "modify, impair, or supersede" federal law.


173
Therefore, the reading offered by Celpage and the CMRS Providers does not represent the unambiguous intent of Congress. The FCC's reading reflects Congress's unambiguous intent as expressed in the plain language of the statute and takes into account Congress's instruction that § 254 be construed in ways that do not conflict with other federal laws.66 Therefore, we reject Celpage and the CMRS providers' challenges to this section of the Order.


174
(b) CMRS Providers as Interstate Carriers.


175
Celpage and the CMRS Providers raise a weak challenge to state contribution requirements, contending that CMRS providers are "jurisdictionally interstate" and therefore exempt from state assessments. We agree with the FCC that the plain language of § 254(f) simply requires that "[e]very telecommunications carrier that provides intrastate telecommunications services" contribute to state mechanisms. As the agency found, a significant portion of the CMRS providers' services arise from providing intrastate telecommunications services.67 This undeniably significant involvement of CMRS providers in the provision of intrastate service is more than sufficient to place them within the ambit of § 254(f).


176
b. Determining That Interstate Carriers Must Contribute on the Basis of Their International Revenues.


177
COMSAT, a small interstate carrier specializing in providing international telephone service, challenges the FCC's decision to define the universal service base to include the international revenues of interstate carriers. COMSAT derives such a small portion of its revenues from interstate service that it would end up with universal payment obligations exceeding its interstate revenues. It argues that this bizarre outcome violates § 254(d)'s requirement that all universal service contributions be "equitable and nondiscriminatory" and the FCC's own principle of competitive neutrality. At the very least, COMSAT argues, this result shows that the FCC's action is arbitrary and capricious.


178
As a threshold matter, the FCC challenges the availability of judicial review, because COMSAT failed to petition the agency for reconsideration, as required by § 405 of the Act.68 COMSAT responds that the absence of a § 405 petition for rehearing is not a bar to judicial review if the petitioner was a party in the rulemaking proceeding and the FCC was afforded an opportunity to rule on the issue.69 Because COMSAT did participate in the rulemaking proceeding and did file comments70with the agency on this question, we agree that § 405 does not bar our review.71


179
The FCC is more persuasive when it argues that COMSAT is really asking for consideration of its individual circumstance rather than challenging the rule as a whole. In this situation, the FCC argues that waiver is a more appropriate remedy than is judicial review. In fact, COMSAT did file a petition for waiver but withdrew it without explanation shortly before the FCC filed its brief in this case. COMSAT now claims to be bringing this claim on behalf of all international carriers in similar circumstances, but it fails to identify any such entities and remains alone in its petition for review.


180
While waiver may be an appropriate remedy, the FCC cites no authority for the proposition that consideration of a waiver is required before judicial review may occur, and our research has found no such authority. The case relied on by the FCC stands only for the proposition that waiver will be allowed as long as the underlying rule is rational.72 We see no statutory basis for denying judicial review on the ground that a party must first seek a waiver. Therefore, we consider the rule on its merits.


181
COMSAT's attack boils down to the argument that it is being unfairly treated because it will be forced to pay more in universal service contributions than it can generate in interstate revenues.73 It makes a compelling argument that this result alone violates the equitable language of the statute. The FCC's response to the statutory challenge simply states that there is nothing "inequitable" about requiring a carrier benefiting from universal service from contributing to it.


182
Under this reading, however, it is difficult to know what the FCC would consider inequitable, because any carrier could conceivably benefit from universal service. Obviously, the language also refers to the fairness in the allocation of contribution duties. In this matter, COMSAT can show that it is being forced to pay more under this rule than it can generate in revenues, yet the FCC does not find even this situation "inequitable."


183
Moreover, the FCC dismisses COMSAT's claim that the agency violates the "nondiscriminatory" requirement of § 254(d) simply by saying that the agency has recognized that some providers of international service will be treated differently from others. But this recognition of discrimination hardly saves the agency from the statutory requirement that contributions are collected on a non-discriminatory basis.


184
The agency falls back on its discretion, under the statute, to balance the competing concerns set forth in § 254(b), which include the need for sufficient revenues to support universal service. While the statute allows the FCC a considerable amount of discretion, however, that discretion is not absolute. The heavy inequity the rule places on COMSAT and similarly situated carriers cannot simply be dismissed by the agency as a consequence of its administrative discretion.


185
Therefore, the agency's interpretation of "equitable and nondiscriminatory," allowing it to impose prohibitive costs on carriers such as COMSAT, is "arbitrary and capricious and manifestly contrary to thestatute." Chevron, 467 U.S. at 844. COMSAT and carriers like it will contribute more in universal service payments than they will generate from interstate service.74 Additionally, the FCC's interpretation is "discriminatory," because the agency concedes that its rule damages some international carriers like COMSAT more than it harms others. The agency has offered no reasonable explanation of how this outcome, which will require companies such as COMSAT to incur a loss to participate in interstate service, satisfies the statute's "equitable and nondiscriminatory" language. We therefore reverse and remand this portion of the Order for further consideration.


186
6. Timing.


187
a. Timetable for the Implementation of an Explicit System of Universal Service Support.


188
On statutory and constitutional grounds, GTE attacks the FCC's timetable for implementation of an explicit system of universal service support.75 First, GTE argues that the agency's decision to wait until January 1, 2000, before implementing its plan for providing explicit support for universal service violates the statutory requirements of § 254. Second, GTE asserts that the delay in implementation results in an unconstitutional taking.


189
i. Statutory Language.


190
GTE contends that the delay in implementation violates § 254(e) because it fails to provide "sufficient" funding to support universal service.76 In fact, between the Order's release on May 8, 1997, and its implementation on January 1, 2000, the FCC will have provided no explicit support to the ILEC's, while it has already exposed them to outside competition. In theory, then, new entrants could begin "cherry-picking" the ILEC's' best lowcost, high-profit customers, leaving the ILEC's stuck with the high-cost, money-losing customers that are supposed to be supported by the new universal service subsidy system. This would erode the old implicit subsidy system before the FCC had implemented the new explicit subsidy system.


191
The question is whether the statute's language plainly requires the FCC to have implemented explicit subsidies at the same time that it issued the Order on May 8, 1997. GTE claims the statute requires immediate implementation. But the plain language of § 254(a)(2) requires us to reach the opposite result:


192
The Commission shall initiate a single proceeding to implement the recommendations from the Joint Board required by paragraph (1) and shall complete such proceeding within 15 months after February 8, 1996. The rules established by such proceeding shall include a definition of the services that are supported by Federal universal service support mechanisms and a specific timetable for implementation.


193
47 U.S.C. § 254(a)(2)(emphasis added).


194
By instructing the FCC to establish a "timetable for implementation" by the statutory deadline, Congress assumed the implementation process would occur over a transition period after the fifteen-month deadline. There is no reason to believe--and GTE does not offer a reason--that the instruction to establish a timetable actually means immediate implementation of the explicit subsidy system at the statutory deadline.77


195
Not surprisingly, GTE falls back on the term "sufficient" and argues that even if the FCC may slowly implement the high-cost support program, the statute still requires the agency to ensure that support is sufficient during the transition period. For reasons that we have outlined, the FCC should be accorded a substantial amount of deference when interpreting this word. See supra part III.A.a.i.


196
GTE essentially asks us to hold that "sufficient" is violated whenever there is a change (or the possibility of a change) from the current levels of universal service support. The plain meaning of "sufficient" is far from unambiguous as it pertains to the timing of the high-cost support program's implementation. Calculating how much support is sufficient to provide support for universal service is a judgment the FCC is better able to make than are we, and we therefore defer to its reasonable interpretation under Chevron step-two.


197
As the agency explains, the amount of competition in local markets depends on a number of different factors, of which the implementation of the universal service plan is only one. To enter a new market, entrants must invoke rights to interconnection agreements under §§ 251 and 252.78 In almost all cases, these agreements require lengthy arbitrations by state commissions. Even after the completion of such arbitrations, there may be many court challenges. Because only competition in local markets can erode the current implicit subsidy system to an insufficient level, the FCC made a reasonable determination that there was littlechance of such competition's emerging in the near future.


198
Where the statutory language does not explicitly command otherwise, we defer to the agency's reasonable judgment about what will constitute "sufficient" support during the transition period from one universal service system to another. We follow the Eighth Circuit's recent holding on a similar issue: "The Commission has made a predictive judgment, based on evidence in the record and adequately explained in the order, that competitive pressures in the local exchange market will not threaten universal service during the interim period until the permanent, explicit universal service support mechanisms have been fully implemented." Southwestern Bell, 153 F.3d at 537.


199
ii. Taking.


200
In some ways, GTE's takings argument is simply another version of its contention regarding lack of "sufficient" support. On both issues, GTE argues that the FCC's decision to leave ILEC's exposed to local competition without first implementing the new universal service plan results in a severe reduction of its revenues from local service. Relying on Brooks-Scanlon v. Railroad Comm'n, 251 U.S. 396 (1920), GTE argues that a regulated entity cannot be forced to operate one segment of its business at a loss on the expectation that it can make up the shortfalls from another competitive line of business. At the very least, GTE says, the FCC should adopt a narrow construction of the statutory language to avoid any constitutional infirmities.79


201
The FCC responds that before a narrowing construction should be considered, GTE must show that a taking will "necessarily" result from the regulatory actions. See United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, 474 U.S. 121, 128 n.5 (1985). Even if GTE can show that some taking will result, it must demonstrate that its losses are so significant that the "net effect" is confiscatory. See Duquesne, 488 U.S. at 310-16.


202
GTE has failed to meet the requirements of Duquesne, because it cannot show that it will lose any revenue at all, much less enough to constitute a taking under more recent precedent. Its attempt to distinguish Duquesne is misguided because, contrary to GTE's claim, the Duquesne Court did not base its finding of takings on the fact that the market was no longer closed to competition.


203
Rather, Duquesne stands for the proposition that "no single ratemaking methodology is mandated by the Constitution, which looks to the consequences a governmental authority produces rather than the techniques it employs." Duquesne, 488 U.S. at 299 (Scalia, J., concurring). Duquesne does not require courts to engage in a takings analysis whenever an agency opens a previously regulated market to competition. Further, as we explained in sustaining the forward-cost looking methodology, GTE's reliance on Brooks-Scanlon is misplaced, because we will not apply the rule in that case to transitional or temporary periods. See Continental Airlines, 784 F.2d at 1251.


204
b. Access Charges at Forward-looking Cost Levels as Soon as Cost Models Are Available.


205
MCI asks the FCC to reduce access charges--the fees charged by ILEC's on interstate calls--to the forward-looking cost level used by the agency to calculate support for high-cost areas. Under the FCC's plan, ILEC's will be required to reduce their access charges by the amount they receive in the form of explicit universal service subsidies. MCI argues that by permitting the ILEC's to retain theamount of access charge revenue above cost, the FCC has violated its statutory mandate to eliminate implicit subsidies when it implements the new universal service plan.


206
This argument differs from GTE's assertions. While GTE seeks immediate implementation of the explicit subsidy program, MCI seeks to include the elimination of implicit subsidies within the rubric of the explicit subsidy program. In fact, GTE's fear that implicit subsidies will be eroded during the transition period is precisely the goal of MCI's intervention. Because GTE does not seek the elimination of the implicit subsidies, it is making an argument different from MCI's.


207
For this reason, we agree with the FCC that MCI cannot properly intervene on this issue, because none of the petitioners raised the same challenges to the Order. In United Gas Pipe Line, 824 F.2d at 437, we held that "intervenors may not challenge aspects of the Commission's orders not raised in the petitions for review." Because MCI's challenge does not raise an issue brought up by any of the petitioners, we do not consider its arguments on appeal, but follow the District of Columbia Circuit and decline to grant intervenor standing in a situation in which "we could grant [the intervenor] the full relief it seeks while rejecting all of the petitioners' challenges, and vice versa." Illinois Bell Tel. Co. v. FCC, 911 F.2d 776, 786 (D.C. Cir. 1990).80


208
c. Plan for Transition to a New Universal Service System For Rural, Insular, and High-cost Areas.


209
The FCC's transition plan for its new explicit subsidy universal support system does not immediately apply to all ILEC's. All carriers eligible for universal service support will become part of the new system on January 1, 2000. Small rural carriers, however, will not be required to move into the new system until 2001 at the earliest. See Order ¶ 204. Specifically, the agency (1) has exempted rural carriers, defined as those carriers serving study areas of less than 100,000 lines, from the new forward-looking cost methodology until at least January 1, 2001,81 and (2) has allowed carriers with 200,000 or fewer working loops per study area to continue recovering extra support from the high-cost fund until implementation of the new methodology on January 1, 2000. See Order § 210.


210
i. Establishing a Longer Transition Period for Rural Carriers with fewer than 100,000 lines.


211
Vermont82 attacks the small rural carrier exemption because it does not permit large carriers who happen to serve rural areas the same delayed transitional treatment that rural carriers with studyareas of less than 100,000 lines will receive. Vermont argues that there is no statutory or reasonable basis for distinguishing among rural carriers simply because of their size. For example, census statistics show that Vermont has more residents living in rural areas than does any other state, yet its carrier, Bell Atlantic, does not qualify for the same treatment as do other rural carriers as defined by the FCC's 100,000-line distinctions.


212
Vermont does not point to any statutory authority for its claim that the FCC must give all rural carriers the same treatment under the plan. Instead, it simply argues there is no good reason to treat Bell Atlantic differently from other rural carriers. For these reasons, it asks us to reverse on arbitrary-and-capricious grounds under the APA.


213
A statute survives judicial scrutiny under the APA's "arbitrary and capricious" standard as long as the agency "articulates a rational relationship between the facts found and the choice made" and "so long as the agency gave at least minimal consideration to relevant facts contained in the record." Harris, 19 F.3d at 1096. The FCC provides at least two reasons that articulate such a "rational relationship."


214
First, because the agency delayed the transition for rural carriers on the ground that its cost models for small carriers were inadequate, it was reasonable to treat Bell Atlantic differently. After all, Bell Atlantic is a large ILEC for which the FCC does have cost models. Second, the FCC justifies its delay for small rural carriers because it has found that they will have greater difficulty adjusting to a new system. Again, such a finding would not apply to Bell Atlantic. These reasons suffice.


215
ii. Continuing Application of Existing High-cost Rules until the New Universal Service system Takes Effect.


216
Vermont83 challenges the decision to maintain extra support for ILEC's with study areas of 200,000 or fewer loops until the new methodology is implemented on January 1, 2000. In other words, by exempting carriers with 200,000 or fewer lines from the new high-cost support methodology, the FCC again decided to give extra support to smaller carriers, in this case defined as those carriers with study areas containing 200,000 or fewer loops. As it did in challenging the 100,000 line distinction, Vermont asserts that the distinction is arbitrary and capricious because the FCC ignores evidence that size is not a reliable predictor of cost.


217
The FCC again argues that the 200,000-line rule is transitional, interim relief. The agency has stated that the extra support provided by this rule will expire when the new forward-looking cost methodology goes into effect on January 1, 2000. It asks us to accord it the "substantial deference" it needs to develop transitional solutions to complex regulatory problems. See MCI Telecomms. v. FCC, 750 F.2d 135, 140 (D.C. Cir. 1984).


218
In contrast to the situation involving the rural carrier exemption, the FCC has set a specific date for the end of this transitional period: January 1, 2000. Accordingly, the agency's commitment to a specific date for termination of the support resulting from the 200,000-loop rule makes the rule sufficiently transitional to avoid judicial review. Therefore, for lack of ripeness, we will not review Vermont's challenge to the effects of the 200,000-loop distinction.84


219
B. Subsidization of Services for Schools, Libraries, and Health Care Providers.


220
Section 254(h) adds a new wrinkle to the concept of universal service by directing the FCC to provide support to elementary and secondary schools, libraries, and health care providers. Thus, the agency has a new statutory mandate to subsidize support for certain beneficiaries, irrespective of whether they are high-cost consumers. GTE raises objections to the agency's implementation of this broad statutory mandate,85 and Cincinnati Bell and the states challenge the proposal to assess contributions to this new universal service fund.


221
1. Mandating Support for Internet Access and Internal Connections to Schools and Libraries.


222
While section 254(h) plainly authorizes the FCC to support discounted telecommunications services to schools and libraries, GTE finds no equivalent statutory authority to support discounted internet access and internal connections. Therefore, GTE argues that the agency exceeded its statutory authority when it mandated support for discounted internet services and internal connections.


223
Although we agree with GTE that the statute and its legislative history do not support the FCC's interpretation, the language of the statute is ambiguous enough to require deference under Chevron step-two. Because, however, the FCC's decision to extend universal service support to internet access and internal connections raises grave doubts as to whether § 254(h) creates an unconstitutional tax, we construe the statute narrowly to avoid raising these constitutional problems.86


224
The FCC concedes that internet access and internal connections cannot be defined as "telecommunications services" for purposes of the section.87 It argues, however, that the plain language of § 254(h)(1)(B) and (c)(3) authorizes it to require discounted internet access and internal connections to schools and libraries (but not to health care providers).


225
Subsection 254(h)(1)(B) requires all telecommunications providers to provide to elementary schools, secondary schools, and libraries, on request, discounted services "that are within the definition of universal service under subsection (c)(3) of this section." Subsection (c)(3) authorizes the FCC to designate "additional services for such support mechanisms for schools, libraries, and health care providers for thepurposes of subsection (h) of this section." These "additional services" are "[i]n addition to services included in the definition of universal service under paragraph (1)," which defines universal service as an "evolving level of telecommunications services."


226
The FCC points out that there is no language restricting these "additional" services to telecommunications services. Furthermore, Congress used the limiting term "telecommunications services" in § 254(h)(1)(A) when discussing the provision of universal service support for rural health care providers. The agency argues that "the varying uses of the terms 'telecommunications services' and 'services' in § 254(h)(1)(A) and (B) suggests that the terms were used consciously to signify different meanings." Order ¶ 439. Therefore, the FCC concluded that the term "additional services" is not limited to telecommunications services. It then decided that, based on the legislative history and its understanding of the purposes of the statute, it should require internet access and internal connections88 support for schools and libraries.


227
We first consider whether the FCC's interpretation conflicts with the plain language of § 254(h)(1)(B) and (c)(3). Although the best reading of the statute does not authorize the agency's actions, we find the statute sufficiently ambiguous to invoke step- two of Chevron.


228
The statute restricts the FCC's authority to interpret the phrase "additional services" in subsection (c)(3) to "the purposes of subsection (h) of this section." The use of the phrase "telecommunications services" in the title of § 254(h) indicates that the "purposes of subsection (h)" are to provide discounted support for telecommunications services.89


229
We find further support for this reading in the legislative history of § 254(h): "New subsection (h) of section 254 is intended to ensure that health care providers for rural areas, elementary and secondary school classrooms, and libraries have affordable access to modern telecommunications services . . . ."90 The House Conference Report also elaborates on the interaction between subsections (h)(1)(B) and (c)(3):


230
New section (h)(1)(B) requires that any telecommunications carrier shall, upon a bona fide request, provide services for educational purposes included in the definition of universal service under new subsection (c)(3) for elementary and secondary schools and libraries at rates that are less than the amounts charged for similar services to other parties, and are necessary to ensure affordable access to and use of such telecommunications services.91


231
And while the legislative history of subsection (c)(3) supports giving the FCC discretion when designating services for schools and libraries, it nevertheless describes the subsection (c)(3) definition as "applicable only to public institutional telecommunications users."92 This language provides more evidence that Congress intended thatthe FCC designate additional telecommunications services under subsection (c)(3) rather than any additional services that the agency deems desirable.


232
Indeed, the agency's broad reading of "additional services" would mean that the use of the word "services" in other parts of § 254(c) could be broadened to include non-telecommunications services. For instance, § 254(c)(2) authorizes the Joint Board to recommend modifications to the definition of "services." Under the FCC's interpretation, the Joint Board (composed of state telecommunications regulators and members of the FCC) could be free to redefine "services" to include services unrelated to telecommunications. This result is an implausible reading of Congress's intent.93


233
This is not the end of the analysis, however, because some aspects of the statute's language and legislative history also support the FCC's reading. First, the plain language of § 254(c)(1) invites the FCC periodically to re-define "universal service" to "tak[e] into account advances in telecommunications and information technologies and services." Moreover, the "purposes of subsection (h)" language in subsection (c)(3) could include more than the "telecommunications services" referred to in § 254(h)'s section heading. After all, subsection (h)(2)(A), which is also one of the "purposes of subsection (h)," instructs the FCC to establish competitively neutral rules to "enhance . . . access to advanced telecommunications and information services . . . ."


234
Finally, some of the legislative history implies that Congress intended for subsection(h) to support internet access:


235
[T]he provisions of subsection (h) will help open new worlds of knowledge, learning and education to all Americans--rich and poor, rural and urban. They are intended, for example, to provide the ability to browse library collections, review the collections of museums, or find new information on the treatment of an illness, to Americans everywhere via schools and libraries.94


236
The reference to "brows[ing] library collections" indicates that in drafting subsection (h), Congress envisioned some kind of support for internet access.


237
The best reading of the relevant statutory language nonetheless indicates that the FCC exceeded its authority by mandating discounts for internet access and internal connections. The statutory invitation in subsection (c)(1) to "re-define" universal service to include information services does not necessarily relate to the FCC's authority under subsection (c)(3).


238
Additionally, subsection (h)(2)(A) provides the agency only with authority to "establish competitively neutral rules to enhance access" to information services. It does not contain specific language supporting provision of such services "at rates less than the amounts charged for similar services to other parties," as in subsection (h)(1)(B). And finally, the legislative history does not indicate whether Congress thought the statute would enhance access to internet services through discounts on telecommunications services or, instead, through direct subsidies for internet access.


239
Even though GTE has offered a persuasive reading of the statute, its plain language does not make Congress's intentsufficiently "unambiguous" for Chevron step-one review. Therefore, we defer to the FCC's interpretation under Chevron step-two and affirm those aspects of the Order providing internet services and internal connections to schools and libraries.95


240
2. Authority To Provide Support Payments to Non-telecommunications Entities That Provide Internet Access and Internal Connections to Schools and Libraries.


241
The FCC invokes its rulemaking power under § 254(h)(2)(A) and its "necessary and proper" authority under § 154(i) to provide support payments to non-telecommunications entities that provide internet access and internal connections to schools and libraries. GTE attacks this decision as violating the express intent of Congress as read through the plain language of the statute.


242
The FCC does not argue that any specific provision of the statute authorizes it to add non-telecommunications companies to the universal service payment system. Rather, it avers that (1) the statute gives it broad authority to establish competitively neutral rules; (2) the statute does not speak directly to the issue of non-telecommunications providers; and (3) the statute's silence indicates that the agency should receive Chevron deference.


243
GTE relies on the traditional maxim of statutory construction, "expressio unius est exclusio alterius."96 GTE points out that § 254(h)(1)(B) already discusses how carriers will be reimbursed for providing discounted services: "[a] telecommunications carrier providing service under this paragraph . . . ." According to GTE, Congress's choice of the phrase "telecommunications carrier" precludes the FCC from providing those same payments to non-telecommunications carriers.


244
We conclude that the combination of the FCC's "necessary and proper" authority under § 154(i) and the limited usefulness of the expressio unius doctrine in the administrativecontext permit the FCC to expand the reach of universal support to non-telecommunications carriers. While courts have rightly warned against using silence in a statute to give "agencies virtually limitless hegemony,"97 we are convinced that Congress intended to allow the FCC broad authority to implement this section of the Act.


245
In Iowa Utilities Board, the Eighth Circuit offered this explanation of the reach of § 154(i) in denying the FCC jurisdiction over the pricing of local telephone service: "[Section 154(i)] merely suppl[ies] the FCC with ancillary authority to issue regulations that may be necessary to fulfill its primary directives contained elsewhere in the statute. [It does not] confer[] additional substantive authority." 120 F.3d at 795. In this matter, however, the FCC is not asserting additional substantive authority, as it tried to do in Iowa Utilities. It is not asserting additional jurisdictional authority, but, rather, is issuing a regulation "necessary to fulfill its primary directives."


246
The agency's primary directive is to "enhance access to advanced telecommunications and information services" for schools and libraries. See § 254(h)(2)(A). It is taking modest steps to ensure that Congress's instructions on expanding universal service in the form of internet access and internal connections will not be frustrated by local monopolies.98 For these reasons, we affirm the decision to permit support of non-telecommunications carriers providing internet access and internal connections to schools and libraries.


247
3. Encroaching on State Authority To Set Discount Rates for Intrastate Services to Schools and Libraries.


248
Section 254(h)(1)(B) divides the regulation of discount rates on services offered to schools and libraries between the FCC and the states. "The discount shall be an amount that the Commission, with respect to interstate services, and the States, with respect to intrastate services, determine is appropriate and necessary to ensure affordable access to and use of such services by such entities." § 254(h)(1)(B).


249
The FCC has decided to offer federal universal service funds to help support the intrastate rate discounts. Predictably, the agency has conditioned such funding on the states' "establish[ing] intrastate discounts at least equal to the discounts on interstate services." Order ¶ 550. GTE challenges this condition as an encroachment on the states' statutory right to "determine [what is] appropriate and necessary to ensure affordable access."


250
GTE has failed to point to any statutory or other authority prohibiting the FCC's condition for funding. States are free to refuse federal support for intrastate discounts and, therefore, remain free to determine what is "appropriate and necessary," consistent with the plain language of the statute. In the Tenth Amendment context, this court has refused to view similar federal conditional grants as "equivalent to coercion." See Texas v. United States, 106 F.3d 661, 666 (5th Cir. 1997). Without express statutory language prohibiting such a practice, we reject GTE's challenge to the FCC's funding conditions.


251
4. Exercising Authority in Deciding That Schools and Libraries Can Obtain Discounts on All Commercially Available Telecommunications Services.


252
The FCC has also decided that, pursuant to its authority under § 254(c)(3), it will allow schools and libraries to obtain supported discounts on all commerciallyavailable telecommunications services. The agency believes that this approach will maximize schools' and libraries' flexibility to purchase whatever package of services they need.


253
GTE challenges the agency's statutory authority to refuse to limit the types of services that will be available for support. It contends that the plain language of § 254(c)(3) requires the FCC to "designate" which telecommunications services will receive universal service support and which telecommunications services will not. The key to GTE's argument is the meaning of "designate."


254
According to GTE, "designate" denotes some action of specific selection. The standard dictionary definition of "designate" includes "to distinguish as to class" and "to indicate and set apart for a specific purpose, office, or duty." Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 313 (10th ed. 1994). GTE claims that by using the word "designate," Congress instructed the FCC to "indicate and set apart" which services may receive support under § 254(h). GTE also finds support in the legislative history, which says the FCC should "take into account the particular needs of . . . schools and libraries."99


255
We disagree with GTE that the plain-meaning understanding of "designate" demonstrates Congress's unambiguous intent to require the FCC to specify which services will be supported. By using the word "designate," Congress also could have meant for the agency to authorize a broad class of services. Thus, by "designating" all commercially available telecommunications service, the FCC can be said to have "designated" which services may be supported. For this reason, the designation "commercially available telecommunications services" does not violate the plain meaning of the statute under Chevron step-one.


256
Under Chevron step-two, the FCC has reasonably concluded that it can fulfill its statutory duty to "designate" while giving schools and libraries the maximum flexibility to choose which services they need. It is not unreasonable for the FCC to conclude that it could best "take into account . . .the particular needs" of schools and libraries by allowing support for all commercially available telecommunications services.100 Because Congress's use of "designate" in subsection (c)(3) does not unambiguously require the FCC to limit which services may be supported, and because the FCC's decision is reasonable under Chevron step-two, we reject GTE's request and affirm the decision to allow schools and libraries to obtain support for all "commercially available telecommunications services."


257
5. Authority To Subsidize Toll-Free Telephone Calls to Internet Service Providers by Non-rural Health Care Providers.


258
Congress directed the FCC to provide universal service support for "any public or nonprofit health provider that serves persons who reside in rural areas." § 254(h)(1)(A). Congress also instructed the agency "to enhance, to the extent technically feasible and economically reasonable, access to advanced telecommunications and information services for all public and nonprofit . . . health care providers." The FCC has seized on the more general language in the second provision as authority for subsidizing telephone calls to internet service providers by both rural and non-rural health care providers.


259
GTE advances an argument based on the expressio unius canon. Because the first provision gives specific instructions onproviding subsidized support for health care providers and explicitly limits that support to rural health care providers, GTE argues that the FCC has no statutory authority to expand such support to non-rural health care providers. In the agency's view, Congress could have extended support to non-rural providers, but chose not to. This signifies a Congressional decision that the FCC should respect.


260
The FCC responds that the expressio unius canon should not resolve a question of statutory interpretation in an administrative law context. Additionally, it argues that § 254(h)(2)(A) obligates the FCC to "enhance, to the extent technically feasible and economically reasonable, access to advanced telecommunications and information services."


261
We do not read § 254(h)(2)(A)'s "enhancing" language to require the FCC to act as it did here. But, we conclude that the language in § 254(h)(2)(A) demonstrates Congress's intent to authorize expanding support to "advanced services," when possible, for non-rural health providers.


262
GTE has already established that § 254(h)(1)(A) requires support for telecommunications service to rural health care providers only. We can then read § 254(h)(2)(A) as an instruction to the FCC to work to support "advanced services" for non-rural health care providers when "economically reasonable." Importantly, the FCC's plan does not extend, to non-rural health providers, the same telecommunications discounts enjoyed by § 254(h)(1)(A) rural health providers. Rather, the agency chose to support access (through subsidized telephone calls) to an "advanced . . . information service" (an internet service provider), finding that this subsidy was "economically reasonable" and "technically feasible." Order ¶ 748.


263
The FCC has found a way to "enhance access," as authorized by the plain language of § 254(h)(2)(A), so we affirm this portion of the Order.


264
6. Contribution System To Provide Universal Service Funding for Schools, Libraries, and Rural Health Providers.


265
The FCC decided to fund the universal support mechanisms for schools, libraries, and rural health care providers by "assessing both the interstate and intrastate revenues of providers of interstate telecommunications services." Order ¶ 808. The uncertainty of state support for the new § 254(h) subsidies and other financial considerations, according to the FCC, justifies assessing both the intrastate and interstate revenues of interstate carriers.


266
Cincinnati Bell ("CBT"), a small carrier with a mostly intrastate revenue base, attacks the decision as a violation of § 2(b)'s prohibition on federal regulation of intrastate services. The states challenge the FCC's related assertion that it has the authority to require carriers to recover their intrastate contributions from the states.


267
a. Authority To Assess Contributions on the Combined Interstate and Intrastate Revenues of Carriers That Provide Interstate Telecommunications Services.


268
Along the same lines as Bell Atlantic's challenge to the "no disconnect" rule, CBT argues that the FCC's decision to assess intrastate revenues exceeds its jurisdiction, in violation of the still-intact Louisiana PSC reading of § 2(b). CBT contends that unlike the provisions considered in Iowa Utilities, § 254 does not "apply" to intrastate matters in a sufficiently unambiguously manner so as to confer federal jurisdiction.


269
As we have discussed, we understand § 2(b) to serve as both a rule of statutory construction in considering whether a provision applies to intrastate matters and as a jurisdictional fence against assertions of the FCC's ancillary jurisdiction. See Iowa Utilities, 119 S. Ct. at 731. Like Bell Atlantic, CBT is using § 2(b) to challenge theFCC's construction of § 254 to apply to intrastate ratemaking.


270
The FCC's first defense denies that its actions even constitute a "regulation" that would fall under the rule of statutory construction created by § 2(b) and Louisiana PSC. The agency argues that simply factoring intrastate revenues into calculations of universal service contributions does not constitute regulation of those services. The FCC has used both intrastate and interstate revenues as a basis for imposing accounting obligations or tariff requirements in other contexts without any court's finding § 2(b) violations. Additionally, the FCC has stated that carriers may recover their contributions only from interstate rates. The agency believes this last requirement will prevent its contribution requirements from improperly affecting intrastate rates.


271
Despite the persuasiveness of this argument, we conclude that § 2(b)'s broad language encompasses the FCC's decision to assess intrastate revenues. The plain language of § 2(b) discusses "jurisdiction with respect to . . . charges, classifications, practices, services, facilities, or regulations for or in connection with intrastate communication service . . . ." We agree with CBT that the inclusion of intrastate revenues in the calculation of universal service contributions easily constitutes a "charge . . . in connection with intrastate communication service."


272
The plain language of § 2(b) directs courts to consider FCC jurisdiction over a very broad swathe of intrastate services. We decline to exempt the FCC's assessment of intrastate revenues from the ambit of § 2(b).101


273
The FCC then contends that § 254 does apply to intrastate matters, because it unambiguously authorizes the agency to develop universal service mechanisms that are sufficient to support both interstate and intrastate service. In support of this assertion, the agency points to § 254(d)'s requirement that "[e]very telecommunications carrier that provides interstate telecommunications services shall contribute . . . to the specific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms established by the Commission to preserve and advance universal service." The FCC then compares this language to § 254(f), which allows states to adopt universal service regulations as long as they do not "rely on or burden Federal universal service support mechanisms." This language, the FCC claims, shows that Congress intended for it to bear the primary responsibility for ensuring the sufficiency of universal service for both interstate and intrastate services.


274
These two provisions do not reflect enough of an unambiguous grant of authority to overcome the presumption established by § 2(b). While, under Chevron step-two, we usually give the agency deference in its interpretation of ambiguous statutory language, the Supreme Court continues to require the agency to overcome the § 2(b) statutory presumption with unambiguous language showing that the statute applies to intrastate matters. See Iowa Utilities, 119 S. Ct. at 731.


275
While the text of the statute does not impose any limitation on how universal service will be funded, it also does not explicitly state that the FCC has the responsibility to fund intrastate universal services. The agency seeks authority "in the broad language" of the statute, but"we do not find the meaning of the section so unambiguous or straightforward as to override the command of § 152(b)." See Iowa Utilities, 119 S. Ct. at 731 (quoting Louisiana PSC, 476 U.S. at 377).


276
Without a finding that § 254 applies, the FCC has no other basis to assert jurisdiction, because Iowa Utilities explicitly prohibits FCC jurisdiction over intrastate matters stemming from the agency's plenary powers. See id. Therefore, we reverse that portion of the Order that includes intrastate revenues in the calculation of universal service contributions.


277
b. Authority To Refer Carriers to the States To Seek Recovery of Intrastate Contributions.


278
Though it stated that it had "the authority to refer carriers to the states to seek authority to recover a portion of their intrastate contribution from intrastate rates," Order ¶ 818, the FCC also declined to exercise this authority. Instead, it directed carriers to recover their contributions from interstate revenues only.


279
The states and CBT challenge this assertion of authority on the same grounds they question the inclusion of intrastate revenues for universal service contributions. Because the FCC bases its authority on the same provisions it cited on that issue, our decision to deny the agency jurisdiction on that question applies equally to the its claim of authority to assess intrastate rates.


280
The FCC also raises a prudential defense, arguing that because it has not chosen to exercise its authority, the issue is not yet ripe for judicial review. Additionally, the agency argues that both petitioners lack standing. We do not accept either of these prudential defenses.


281
i. Ripeness.


282
Conceding that the FCC has not yet acted on its decision to assert authority over intrastate services, the states reject the agency's ripeness claim because the "question presented is purely legal." See New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v. Council of the City of New Orleans, 833 F.2d 583, 587 (5th Cir. 1987).102 Pointing also to Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation & Dev. Comm'n, 461 U.S. 190 (1983), the states argue that when the FCC has asserted its authority in a final decision on a legal question such as its jurisdiction over intrastate rates, "one does not have to await the ultimate impact of the threatened injury to obtain preventive relief." See id. at 201.


283
This issue is ripe for judicial review. The two factors for considering ripeness--fitness for judicial decision and hardship to the parties--support our consideration of this question. Courts should be able to resolve a question such as jurisdiction and authority under the Act. Additionally, the states already have shown one example of the harm in withholding review. For instance, MCI, in the face of state opposition, has already begun billing some customers based on revenue from intrastate calls.103


284
ii. Standing.


285
The FCC's standing defense has even less merit. First, states have a sovereign interest in "the power to create and enforce a legal code." See Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, 458 U.S. 592, 601 (1982). Moreover, the FCC's refusal to exercise its declared authority does not deprive states of standing. The states point out that the District of Columbia Circuit will not find a lack of standing simply because an agency has refused to enforce its own regulations. See Alaska v. United States Dep't of Transp., 868 F.2d 441, 444 (D.C. Cir. 1989). For the same reasons, we also reject the FCC's standing defense.


286
iii. Merits.


287
Having disposed of the FCC's prudential defenses, we reverse its claim that it can refer these carriers to the states for recovery of those contributions. This is for the same reasons that we reject the agency's assertions of jurisdiction to assess intrastate revenues for contributions. The FCC has failed to point to any statutory authority that explicitly demonstrates how § 254 applies to intrastate universal service. Therefore, we deny the agency's claim of jurisdiction and reverse this portion of the Order.104


288
IV. Conclusion.


289
It is difficult to disagree with the Supreme Court's assessment that the Act is "a model of ambiguity or indeed even self-contradiction." Iowa Utilities, 119 S. Ct. at 738. As the Court notes, Congress realizes that many of these ambiguities will be resolved by the FCC during its implementation of the statute, and we, like the Court, generally defer to the agency's interpretation of the sometimes-mysterious sections. See Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-43. In this case, we have done so, and we affirm most aspects of the Order implementing the universal service program and dismiss challenges to several parts of the Order as moot.


290
Still, our deferential approach does not require us to affirm the FCC in every circumstance. In particular, the agency exceeded its statutory authority in (1) prohibiting the states from imposing eligibility requirements and (2) requiring ILEC's to recover their contributions from access charges. Applying the Court's most recent pronouncements on the Act, we also deny the FCC jurisdiction over state control of local service disconnections and universal service contributions based on intrastate revenues. We remand one petition to the agency for reconsideration, so it can reconsider the propriety of assessing the international revenues of interstate carriers.


291
For the reasons stated, the petitions for review are GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. The May 8, 1997, Universal Service Order is AFFIRMED in part, REMANDED in part, and REVERSED in part, in accordance with this opinion.



NOTES


1
 Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56 (to be codified as amended in scattered sections of title 47, United States Code).


2
 In economic terms, universal service programs are justified as a way to address a "market failure." While the carriers have little incentive to expand the telecommunications infrastructure into areas of low population density or geographic isolation, each individual user of the network benefits from the greatest possible number of users. See Eli M. Noam, Will Universal Service and Common Carriage Survive the Telecommunications Act of 1996?, 97 Colum. L. Rev. 955, 958-59 (1997).


3
 The first Recommended Decision was issued on November 8, 1996 (12 FCC Rcd 87 (1996)), the second Recommended Decision on November 25, 1998 (13 FCC Rcd 24744 (1998)).


4
 Congress also directed that the FCC establish rules to achieve the local competition goals of the Act within six months of the Act's enactment. The agency met this deadline when it issued the Local Competition Order on August 8, 1996. Almost all parts of this order were affirmed by the Supreme Court. See AT&T v. Iowa Utils. Bd., 119 S. Ct. 721 (1999).
On the same day it issued the Order, the FCC released the Access Charge Order. Access charges are the charges assessed between local exchange companies (LEC's) and interexchange companies (IXC's) for the use of one network by callers from the other network. Challenges to this order were also consolidated before the Eighth Circuit. See Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. FCC, 153 F.3d 523 (8th Cir. 1998).


5
 This methodology is a departure from the revenue-based national benchmark proposed in the Order. The revenue-based benchmark was challenged for including discretionary revenues in its calculation and for its nationwide scope. Because of the revisions proposed by the Joint Board's Second Recommended Decision, we now consider those challenges to the prior revenue-based methodology moot. See infra part III.A.1.b.


6
 The agency made a decision to provide only 25% of the funds for high-cost support, leaving the state commissions ("the states") to provide the rest of the funds. According to the FCC, the states traditionally have provided a majority of universal service support, and if the agency were to fund all the high-cost support, it would overcompensate carriers. Moreover, the FCC claims that the 25% figure approximates the costs that historically have been assigned to the interstate jurisdiction. See Order ¶ 201.
The Joint Board, however, recommended that the FCC scrap the 25%/75% division of responsibility in favor of a more flexible plan of allocation. See Second Recommended Decision ¶¶ 4-5, 41-46. The FCC accepted the Joint Board's recommendation and eliminated the 25/75 rule on May 27, 1999, thereby mooting the issue for this court. See infra part III.A.1.c. See also Seventh Report and Order ¶ 3 ("We explicitly reconsider and repudiate any suggestion in the First Report and Order that federal support should be limited to 25 percent of the difference between the benchmark and forward-looking cost estimates . . . .").


7
 These carriers include wireless service providers of paging and commercial mobile radio service ("CMRS"). The FCC also rejected a claim by CMRS providers seeking an exemption from making contributions to state support funds.


8
 In the original order, the FCC had planned implementation by January 1, 1999. This date was delayed until July 1, 1999, and again to January 1, 2000. See Seventh Report and Order ¶ 5.


9
 The FCC also determined that it could require carriers to contribute, based on both interstate and intrastate revenues, to high-cost support as well as § 254(h) support. But for policy reasons, it decided to assess contributions on both interstate and intrastate revenues for support of § 254(h) programs only. It maintains, however, that it may impose similar assessments for high-cost support as well. See Seventh Report and Order ¶¶ 87-90.
We review the states' challenge to the FCC's claim of jurisdictional authority over intrastate rates in the context of its actions regarding support of the § 254(h) programs, but we also discuss its implications for FCC jurisdictional authority for support of high-cost programs. See infra, part III.B.5.


10
 See Arent v. Shalala, 70 F.3d 610, 614-16 (D.C. Cir. 1995); see also Gary Lawson, Outcome, Procedure and Process: Agency Duties of Explanation for Legal Conclusions, 48 Rutgers L. Rev. 313 (1996). We recognize the difference between Chevron step-two review and the APA's arbitrary and capricious review is not always obvious. Indeed, the different standards of review overlap, because both require a reviewing court to decide whether the agency action is "manifestly contrary to the statute" (Chevron) or "otherwise not in accordance with law." (APA). See Arent, 70 F.3d at 615 & n.6.


11
 As an initial matter, the FCC asks us to dismiss all challenges to its methodology for calculating high-cost support, claiming that such challenges are not ripe in light of the Joint Board's Second Recommended Decision. The Joint Board advised the agency to make substantial revisions in the high-cost support methodology, including the elimination of the 25%/75% division between federal and state contributions and the modification of the revenue benchmark used to calculate high-cost support. The FCC accepted these recommendations, and we dismiss challenges to those issues as moot. See infra parts III.A.1.b and c.
But the FCC did not modify other portions of the Order, including its use of forward-looking cost models. See Seventh Report and Order ¶ 48. We agree with GTE that the mere existence of a Joint Board recommendation does not permit the FCC to block all judicial review of its high-cost methodology, especially after the agency has issued its order implementing these recommendations.
The Supreme Court has consistently endorsed judicial review of final agency actions. "Although . . . the FCC regulation could properly be characterized as a statement only of intentions, the Court held that 'such regulations have the force of law before their sanctions are invoked as well as after. When, as here, they are promulgated by order of the Commission and the expected conformity to them causes injury cognizable by a court of equity, they are appropriately the subject of attack . . . .'" Abbott Lab. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 150 (1967) (quoting Columbia Broadcasting Sys. v. United States, 316 U.S. 407, 418-19 (1942)).
Additionally, we consider four factors when evaluating a claim of lack of ripeness in the administrative context: (1) whether the issues are purely legal; (2) whether the issues are based on a final agency action; (3) whether the controversy has a direct and immediate impact on the plaintiff; and (4) whether the litigation will expedite, rather than delay or impede, effective enforcement by the agency. See Dresser Indus. v. United States, 596 F.2d 1231, 1235 (5th Cir. 1979). To find a case ripe, we require the party bringing the challenge (here, GTE) to establish all four factors in seeking judicial review. See Merchants Fast Motor Lines, Inc. v. Interstate Commerce Comm'n, 5 F.3d 911, 920 (5th Cir. 1993).
The FCC does not claim that the issues presented are not purely legal, and we have already explained why, under Abbott Laboratories, the Order remains a final agency action. There is no indication that the petitioners are currently unaffected by the legal force of the Order. Finally, we agree with GTE that because the FCC has had ample time (three years) and opportunity to implement the Order, judicial guidance on the legality of the Order will not delay or impede the agency's ability to carry out its statutory duties.


12
 GTE refers us to Justice Brandeis's dissent (joined by Justice Holmes) in Missouri ex rel. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. Public Serv. Comm'n, 262 U.S. 276 (1922), criticizing use of "fair value" (another version of forward-looking cost models) in ratemaking. GTE notes that Justice Breyer has endorsed Justice Brandeis's criticisms. Even in his separate opinion in Iowa Utilities, however, Justice Breyer did not advocate that the Court prohibit the FCC from adopting forward-looking cost models. See Iowa Utilities, 119 S. Ct. at 752 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("These examples do not show that the FCC's rules are themselves unreasonable").
Most importantly, the Brandeis criticism of "fair value" has never reflected the view of a majority of the Court, which on several occasions has declined to adopt Justice Brandeis's views on this question. See Federal Power Comm'n v. Texaco Inc., 417 U.S. 380 (1974); Federal Power Comm'n v. Hope Natural Gas Co., 320 U.S. 591 (1944). Instead, the Court consistently has refused to "designat[e] [] a single theory of ratemaking [that] would unnecessarily foreclose alternatives which could benefit both consumers and investors." Duquesne Light Co. v. Barasch, 488 U.S. 299, 316 (1989).
In fact, the Court has explicitly sustained similar cost models not based on historical costs. See Mobil Oil Exploration & Producing Southeast Inc. v. United Distrib. Cos., 498 U.S. 211, 224-25 n.5 (1991) (indicating that similar non-historical based cost model was not arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute at issue.).


13
 See, e.g., West Tex. Util. Co. v. Burlington N.R.R., Docket No. 41191 (Surface Transp. Bd. May 3, 1996), aff'd sub nom. Burlington N.R.R. v. Surface Transp. Bd., 114 F.3d 206, 213 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (sustaining, as reasonable, agency application of "stand alone cost constraints" based on rates that a hypothetical carrier would have to charge to earn a reasonable return).


14
 GTE claims that implementing the forward-looking cost methodology will force ILEC's to operate at a loss, and this constitutes an unconstitutional taking under Brooks-Scanlon. GTE's claim has no merit; it has not shown that a taking has occurred or that any taking will be permanent or would be so serious as to be considered "confiscatory." See Duquesne, 488 U.S. at 314. ("[A]n otherwise reasonable rate is not subject to constitutional attack by questioning the theoretical consistency of the method that produced it.").
Unlike the situation in Brooks-Scanlon, the circumstance here is that the regulatory entity setting the rules, the FCC, is not requiring the ILEC's to remain open or to charge low rates, thereby forcing them to operate at a permanent loss. See Continental Airlines v. Dole, 784 F.2d 1245, 1251 (5th Cir. 1986) (distinguishing Brooks-Scanlon where agency required loss-making operation for a limited time only).


15
 Vermont has filed a petition for review of the Seventh Report and Order in the District of Columbia Circuit. See No. 99-1243 (D.C. Cir.). Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2349(a), it thereby has vested that court with exclusive jurisdiction to review the Seventh Report and Order. Unless the District of Columbia Circuit transfers the petition to this court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2112(a), we lack jurisdiction to consider the order on its merits.
We still retain jurisdiction to the extent that the new order changes or affects the Order that is the subject of this consolidated proceeding. As we explain below, the FCC's repudiation of its revenue benchmarks and the 25% allocation moot the petitioners' challenges for purposes of this appeal. Petitioners, however, are not precluded, by our dismissal in this proceeding, from filing appeals of the new cost-based benchmark and the new allocation methodology in another proceeding.


16
 Mootness goes to the heart of our jurisdiction under Article III of the Constitution. Therefore, we must consider mootness even if the parties do not raise it, because "resolution of this question is essential if federal courts are to function within their constitutional spheres of authority." North Carolina v. Rice, 404 U.S. 244, 245 (1971).


17
 Even if these conditions are met, there are at least three exceptions to the mootness doctrine. First, courts may assert jurisdiction if the official action being challenged is capable of "repetition, yet evading review." See Nader v. Volpe, 475 F.2d 916, 917 (D.C. Cir. 1973). Second, courts also have adjudicated otherwise moot issues if the defendant has voluntarily ceased the challenged activity to avoid judicial resolution and there is a reasonable possibility that the challenged conduct will resume. See Gulth v. Kangas, 951 F.2d 1504, 1507-08 (9th Cir. 1991) (refusing to hold voluntary cessation of prison library restrictions moot in light of long history of policy). Finally, courts have avoided mootness where the mooted issue still has collateral or future consequences. See Super Tire Eng'g Co. v. McCorckle, 416 U.S. 115, 122 (1974) (refusing to moot employer's challenge to state benefits for strikers even though strike had ended, because issue would affect employer's future relations with uni
on).
Only the first and second exceptions are arguably applicable to the FCC's new order, and we do not think either exception applies. The "repetition" exception will not apply unless there is a reasonable expectation that the same litigant will again be subjected to the same action. See DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U.S. 312, 315-17 (1974) (mooting student's lawsuit because he will graduate regardless of outcome of litigation). The second exception requires a showing that the challenged conduct will resume. There is little basis for suggesting that the FCC, after a long and torturous process involving a recommendation from the Joint Board and months of deliberation, will reverse itself on the question of revenue benchmarks.


18
 Reconsideration of agency actions by the implementing agency can moot issues otherwise subject to judicial review because the reviewing court can no longer grant effective relief. See, e.g., Center for Science in the Pub. Interest v. Regan, 727 F.2d 1161, 1164 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (holding that a change in position of Department of Treasury regarding labeling of alcoholic beverages mooted federal appeal); see also 15 James W. Moore, Moore's Federal Practice § 101.96, at 101-179 (3d ed. 1998) ("[A] parallel proceeding in another forum and [] resolution of that controversy in that forum will moot the issues presented in the federal action. . . . regardless of whether or not that parallel forum is an administrative proceeding.").


19
 Accord Center for Science in the Pub. Interest, 727 F.2d at 1164 ("Most of the issues presented in these appeals are not necessarily pertinent to examination of the second [administrative action] and may well prove irrelevant in that context.").


20
 Our conclusion regarding mootness does not conflict with Natural Resources Defense Council v. EPA, 489 F.2d 390 (5th Cir. 1974), in which we refused to moot a challenge to the EPA's approval of Georgia's Clean Air Act implementation plan despite the EPA's later decision to withdraw its approval. Because the EPA's reasons for withdrawing approval showed that it still fundamentally disagreed with the petitioners' interpretation of the Clean Air Act's requirements, we asserted jurisdiction.
In this case, the FCC's new order not only alters, but explicitly repudiates, the reasoning behind its use of revenues in calculating the benchmark. All of the petitioners' challenges to the benchmark calculations focused on the unreliability or unfairness of such revenue-based calculations. By eliminating the use of revenues, the petitioners and the FCC no longer fundamentally disagree on the problems that revenues cause in calculating the benchmark for high-cost support.
Thus, Natural Resources Defense Council does not conflict with the reasoning of Center for Science in the Public Interest, 727 F.2d at 1166, in which the court mooted a challenge after the Treasury had implemented a new, superseding regulation containing different reasoning and substantive provisions different from the challenged regulation. In both cases, the courts analyzed whether the intervening agency action represented a substantive shift in an agency's interpretation of its statutory duties.


21
 Nine state commissions--from Texas, California, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, New York, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and South Dakota--have presented a joint appeal, and we refer to them as "the states."


22
 The state commissions of Kansas and Vermont filed a separate appeal. Although both Kansas and Vermont challenge the 25% allocation, only Vermont maintains its challenge to the FCC's transitional support rules for rural carriers. See infra part III.A.6.c.i.


23
 See Seventh Report and Order § 3 ("We explicitly reconsider and repudiate any suggestion in the First Report and Order that federal support should be limited to 25 percent of the difference between the benchmark and the forward-looking cost estimates. . . .").


24
 Vermont invites us to review the Seventh Report and Order's interpretation of reasonable comparability in the context of that recent order's revised approach to allocating costs between the different states and between the state and federal funds. To the extent that Vermont's "reasonable comparability" arguments were based on a challenge to the 25% allocation, we dismiss its arguments as moot. To the extent its arguments focused on the alleged failure of the FCC to articulate a definition of "reasonable comparability," we would have to examine the merits of the Seventh Report and Order. As we explained, supra n. 16, we cannot review the merits of that order, because we lack jurisdiction over the merits of the new allocation methodology until it is transferred to this court by the District of Columbia Circuit.


25
 "Beginning January 1, 1999, non-rural carriers shall no longer receive support pursuant to this [program]." 47 C.F.R. § 36.601(c).


26
 This implementation date has now been delayed until January 1, 2000. See Seventh Report and Order ¶ 5.


27
 Jurisdictional separations rules are part of a process whereby it "may be determined what portion of an asset is employed to produce or deliver interstate as opposed to intrastate service." Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 356 (1986). Section 410(c) requires the FCC to consult the Joint Board, but it does not "dictate how costs must be recovered . . . ." See National Ass'n of Regulatory Util. Comm'rs v. FCC, 737 F.2d 1095, 1112 n.19 (D.C. Cir. 1984).


28
 The FCC did not arbitrarily and capriciously fail to explain the reason for its amendment of rule 36.601(c). It stated that the new universal service mechanism will replace the old high-cost fund subsidies and that the change will occur on January 1, 1999 (later extended to July 1, 1999 and then to January 1, 2000). The agency's general explanations of the effect of the new support mechanism provide enough of a reason to survive GTE's attack.


29
 The subsection reads:
A State commission shall upon its own motion or upon request designate a common carrier that meets the requirements of paragraph (1) as an eligible telecommunications carrier for a service area designated by the State commission. Upon request and consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity, the State commission may, in the case of an area served by a rural telephone company, and shall, in the case of all other areas, designate more than one common carrier as an eligible telecommunications carrier for a service area designated by a State commission, so long as each additional requesting carrier meets the requirements of paragraph (1). Before designating an additional eligible telecommunications carrier for an area served by a rural telephone company, the State commission shall find that the designation is in the public interest.


30
 See MCI Telecomm. Corp. v. FCC, 765 F.2d 1186, 1191 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (holding that "shall" is "the language of command").


31
 To be sure, if a state commission imposed such onerous eligibility requirements that no otherwise eligible carrier could receive designation, that state commission would probably run afoul of § 214(e)(2)'s mandate to "designate" a carrier or "designate more than one carrier."


32
 Additionally, §152(b) of Act instructs us to construe the Act to avoid giving the FCC jurisdiction over "charges, classifications, practices, services, facilities, or regulations for and in connection with intrastate communications services. . . ." 47 U.S.C. § 152(b). See Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 376 n.5 (1988) ("[Section] 152(b) not only imposes jurisdictional limits on the power of a federal agency, but also, by stating that nothing in the Act shall be construed to extend FCC jurisdiction to intrastate service, provides its own rule of statutory construction."); see also discussion of "no disconnect" rule, infra part III.A.3.


33
 In order to promote competition, the FCC encourages states to adopt the existing study areas of ILECs as service areas for non-rural areas because it would create a significant barrier to entry. The FCC further encourages states to consider designating service areas that the ILECs have not traditionally served, this limiting the ILEC advantage over new entrants.

 The Lifeline program refers to the FCC's efforts to expand telephone services to qualifying low-income subscribers. The agency defines Lifeline services to include single-party service, voice-grade access to the public switched telephone network, BTMF or its functional digital equivalent, access to directory assistance, and toll-limitation services. See Order ¶ 390.

 "[N]othing in this subchapter shall be construed to apply or to give the Commission jurisdiction with respect to (1) charges, classifications, practices, services, facilities, or regulations for or in connection with intrastate communication service by wire or radio of any carrier . . . ." 47 U.S.C. § 152(b) (as amended).

39
 The SBC intervenors challenge a related FCC rule prohibiting the practice of requiring deposits from customers initiating service with toll-blocking for interstate service. Unfortunately for SBC, none of the petitioners on this issue (the states and Bell Atlantic) raised a challenge to this similar but separate rule in the FCC proceeding. Therefore, we cannot consider it on appeal. See United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. FERC, 824 F.2d 417, 437 (5th Cir. 1987).


40
 Bell Atlantic argues that the FCC has waived this argument on appeal. We do not agree. The FCC's brief states that the "no disconnect" rule "does not purport to regulate intrastate service . . . but merely to prevent the disconnection of service (including interstate access service) to customers who have failed to pay toll charges." Though weak, this statement preserves the FCC's attempt to exceed its jurisdictional boundaries on the ground that it cannot regulate an interstate matter without also regulating an intrastate matter.

51
 The Taxing Clause analysis focuses on whether the assessment is a tax or a fee. This question is usually resolved based on whether the revenues are used to primarily defray the expenses of regulating the act. See National Cable Television Ass'n v. United States, 415 U.S. 336, 340 (1974). If it is a tax, then courts will ask whether it has been properly delegated. Id. On the other hand, the Origination Clause analysis asks whether (1) the revenues generated from the assessment are for general revenues or for a particular program and (2) there is a connection between the payors and the beneficiaries of the program. See Munoz-Flores, 495 U.S. at 397. See infra part III.B.1.c. n.83.


52
 Generally, we do not consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief. See Fed. R. App. P. 28(c). Even if Celpage's Taxing Clause argument were properly before us, we find no basis for reversal. As applied to paging carriers, the universal service contribution qualifies as a fee because it is a payment in support of a service (managing and regulating the public telecommunications network) that confers special benefits on the payees. See National Cable, 415 U.S. at 340. Cf. Rural Tele. Coalition v. FCC, 838 F.2d 1307, 1314 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (upholding universal service contributions as a fee supporting allocations between interstate and intrastate jurisdictions).


53
 The Supreme Court has squarely held that Origination Clause challenges are subject to judicial review and do not fall under the political question doctrine. "A law passed in violation of the Origination Clause would thus be no more immune from judicial scrutiny because it was passed by both Houses and signed by the President than would a law passed in violation of the First Amendment." Munoz-Flores, 495 U.S. at 397.


54
 See discussion of § 254(h) support for internet services, infra part III.B.1. Unlike the circumstance in that case, the situation here is that of a telecommunications service provider's (a paging carrier's) being required to support the maintenance of a large telecommunications network.


55
 See § 254(d) ("Every telecommunications carrier that provides interstate telecommunications services shall contribute . . . to the . . . mechanisms established by the Commission to preserve and advance universal service."); § 254(f) ("Every telecommunications carrier that provides intrastate telecommunications services shall contribute . . . .").


56
 The Munoz-Flores Court does not discuss in great detail the importance, in Origination Clause analysis, of some kind of relationship between the payors and the beneficiaries. Still, it makes sense that the Court would insist on some link, because an assessment on one group for the benefit of a completely unrelated group is how courts have distinguished taxes raised for general federal outlays from fees raised for specific programs. Otherwise, Congress could always avoid the Origination Clause requirement because, in theory, all revenue is raised to fund some "particular program." Thus, courts must establish some relationship between the payors and the beneficiaries to avoid the strictures of the Origination Clause.


57
 See Reid, 979 F.2d at 1087 (5th Cir. 1992) (stating that a "decision of a governmental body does not violate equal protection guarantees if there is any basis for the action that bears a debatably rational relationship to a conceivable legitimate governmental end").


58
 See Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank, 473 U.S. 172, 193 (1985).


59
 Even if we considered Celpage's takings claim, it would fail to demonstrate how its claim comports with the three factors the Supreme Court has established to analyze a regulatory takings claim: (1) the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant; (2) the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations; and (3) the character of the governmental action. See Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., 475 U.S. 211, 225 (1986). In particular, Celpage has failed to offer reasonably specific predictions of the size and scale of this taking, thereby failing to show the extent to which the regulation has interfered with its distinct investment-backed expectations.


60
 Celpage also challenges the FCC's ruling for violating its own principle of "competitive neutrality." Because this term has been developed by the FCC through regulation rather than through interpretation of the statute, we should give the agency broad deference in applying this principle, and we can reverse only if we find the FCC's actions "arbitrary, capricious or manifestly contrary to the statute." Chevron, 467 U.S. at 844. The FCC's decision to require paging operators to contribute to the support of a network through which their business operates is not so irrational or arbitrary as to merit reversal.


61

62
 On October 26, 1998, the FCC released an order and a further notice of proposed rulemaking on the question of how to assess wireless carriers' revenues. The agency made a tentative decision to provide wireless carriers with interim guidelines for how to approximate their percentage of interstate wireless revenues. Additionally, the agency sought comment on various proposals for a final guideline on such calculations and comment on the relationship of wireless communications providers to universal service. This order further supports the FCC's position that it has not yet made a final decision on how to handle these issues.

64
 A state commission could require a universal service contribution based on end-user revenues but leave the carrier free to set its rates as it pleases while not blocking new carriers from entering the market. On the other hand, a state commission would be regulating "rates and entry" if it required the carriers to lower rates for one group of customers as part of an implicit subsidy.

75
 The FCC asks us to bar review of this question, arguing that GTE and SBC are collaterally estopped from litigating it because they did so during challenges to the Access Charge Order in the Eighth Circuit. See Southwestern Bell, 153 F.3d at 537. Before applying collateral estoppel, we must first decide whether (1) the issue under consideration is identical to that litigated in the prior action; (2) the issue was fully and vigorously litigated in the prior action; (3) the issue was necessary to support the judgment in the prior case; and (4) there is no special circumstance that would make it unfair to apply the doctrine. See Winters v. Diamond Shamrock Chem. Co., 149 F.3d 387, 391 (5th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 119 S. Ct. 1286 (1999).
We agree with the petitioners that the challenge to the FCC's high-cost support timetable is not "identical," for collateral estoppel purposes, to the issue raised in that case. Although the petitioners challenge the coordination between implicit subsidies in the access charge system and those in the new support system, their challenge in this case involves a broader attack on the timing of the entire universal service high-cost support system rather than on just its interactions with the access charge system.
The Eighth Circuit did not consider the contention that GTE brings before us: that the FCC violated § 254(a) by failing to implement an "explicit" and "sufficient" universal service support system within "fifteen months" of the 1996 Act's enactment. The Eighth Circuit relied on the fact that the deadline for adopting rules on universal service came after the date for adopting rules on opening the market to local competition. See Southwestern Bell, 153 F.3d at 537. Therefore, there was no need for that court to decide whether § 254(a) requires full implementation within "fifteen months" of the enactment, and GTE is not collaterally estopped for pursuing its appeal of § 254(a) in this court. See Winters, 149 F.3d at 391 n.3 ("[U]nless prior issue sought to be precluded from relitigation was a 'critical or necessary part' integral to the prior judgment, collateral estoppel may not apply.").


76
 GTE also claims that the FCC's actions violate the "predictable" and "nondiscriminatory" requirements of § 254(b). We see no merit to this contention and focus instead on GTE's best statutory argument, which relies on the use of the term "sufficient" in § 254(e).


77
 Section 254(e) contemplates that universal support will be "explicit" and "sufficient" "[a]fter the date on which Commission regulations implementing this section [§ 254(e)] take effect." This language further supports the FCC's reading that Congress did not require implementation of the high-cost support program immediately after the 15-month deadline.


78
 The Supreme Court did not issue its final word on these sections until January 25, 1999. See Iowa Utilities, 119 S. Ct. 721. In the meantime, many potential entrants were stymied in the arbitration process and by the uncertainty over the FCC's jurisdiction to implement its local competition order. Therefore, it is not surprising that the agency did not expect an onslaught of local competition during the interim period.


79
 See Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U.S. 568, 575 (1988).


80
 MCI claims that the FCC is trying to evade review of this question through procedural maneuvering. When BellSouth, in its Eighth Circuit challenge to the Access Charge Order, raised the issue of the FCC's failure to remove all implicit subsidies, the agency argued that this question should be addressed in this court in challenges to the Universal Service Order. Now that MCI has raised that same issue, MCI argues that the agency should not be allowed to dodge review again on procedural grounds.
Unfortunately for MCI, it was not any manipulation of procedural rules by the FCC that prevented MCI from properly raising this issue on appeal. There was no legal reason that prevented MCI from filing a brief as a petitioner rather than as an intervenor. Thus, the FCC's procedural moves are irrelevant for purposes of deciding whether MCI may properly intervene. The only question, then, is whether MCI's challenge to the Order for failing to reduce access charges immediately is the same as GTE's challenge to the Order for failing to implement explicit subsidies immediately. We see no such resemblance.

As we have discussed, supra, we do not have jurisdiction to consider the merits of that new Order except in the way that it affects our review of the Order. The "hold harmless" principle was introduced in the Seventh Report and Order and remains outside the scope of this proceeding.


85
 As a threshold matter, GTE challenges the timing of the proposal, because it would require support for schools, libraries, and health care providers before the new system for explicit subsidies has been implemented. For the same reasons we have discussed, see supra part III.A.6.1., we extend the FCC greater discretion in deciding what will be "sufficient" during the transition period, especially when there is little reason to believe that the old subsidy system will break down during that period.


86
 Judge Garza does not join our analysis of the constitutional issues raised by the FCC's decision to provide discounts on internet services for schools and libraries, set forth in note 97, infra. He would not address these issues, because the parties did not raise them on appeal. See Carducci v. Regan, 714 F.2d 171, 177 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (refusing to consider a constitutional issue of first impression "where counsel has made no attempt to address the issue" and "where, as here, important questions of far-reaching significance are involved"). But see United States Nat'l Bank v. Independent Ins. Agents of Am., 508 U.S. 439, 446 (1993) (approving lower court's consideration of legal claim not argued by either party as part of courts' "independent power to identify and apply the proper construction of governing law")(internal quotations omitted); United States v. Moore, 110 F.3d 99, 101 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (en banc) (Silberman, J., dissenting) (conceding that the "rigor and integrity of Carducci was severel
y impaired by the unanimous decision of the Supreme Court" in IndependentInsurance Agents).


87
 The FCC has recognized that internet access or internal connection services are "information services" that cannot be equated with "telecommunications services." See Order ¶ 439 n.1145.


88
 Calling "internal connections" a good and not a service, GTE separately attacks the "internal connections" requirement. The FCC argues that courts have recognized internal connections as services, see NARUC v. FCC, 880 F.2d 422, 430 (D.C. Cir. 1989), and that the legislative history's emphasis on connections to "classrooms" makes such a requirement reasonable. Given that the maintenance and installation of regular telephone lines also is characterized as a "service," we reject GTE's attempt to distinguish "internal connections."


89
 See United States v. Wallington, 889 F.2d 573, 577 (5th Cir. 1989) (stating that the "section heading enacted by Congress in conjunction with statutory text [is considered] to 'come up with the statute's clear and total meaning.'" (citation omitted)).

93
 We also agree with GTE that the FCC is asserting unlimited authority to prescribe support for whatever it wishes. At oral argument, counsel for the FCC could not point out how its interpretation could be limited even to internet access services. For instance, the agency could not explain why satellite television services or even janitorial services would not fit within its understanding of "additional services." In contrast, the plain language of § 254 provides an easily recognizable limit on FCC authority by confining § 254(h) support to telecommunications services. The superiority of GTE's reading, however, does not necessarily make Congress's intent unambiguous.

95
 Before we defer to the FCC's interpretation of an ambiguously worded statute under the deferential Chevron step-two standard of review, we consider whether the agency's approach raises constitutional problems that should lead us to construe the statute in the manner urged by GTE. "[W]here a statute is susceptible of two constructions, by one of which grave and doubtful constitutional questions arise and by the other of which such questions are avoided, our duty is to adopt the latter." Jones v. United States, 119 S. Ct. 1215, 1222 (1999) (internal citations omitted). This rule "has for so long been applied by this Court that it is beyond debate." DeBartolo, 485 U.S. at 574-75. It is also of such importance that a court will reject an agency interpretation of a statute that would ordinarily receive deference under Chevron step-two if it believes the agency's reading raises serious constitutional doubts. Id. (construing statute narrowly to avoid First Amendment problem).
We have identified two ways in which the agency's interpretation could raise constitutional concerns that might lead us to construe the statute more narrowly. First, the FCC's application of the universal service fund for non-telecommunications services could constitute an improperly delegated tax. Second, its interpretation of the reach of § 254(h)(1)(B) could have transformed the Act into a "bil[l] for raising revenue" in violation of the Origination Clause.
Though it is a close question, we conclude that the FCC's interpretation does not raise sufficiently serious constitutional doubts to override our normal Chevron step-two deference. While the relationship between internet services and the public telecommunications network is more attenuated than is that of paging services, see supra part III.A.5.a, we are not convinced that even this attenuated relationship raises serious doubts under Munoz-Flores. For similar reasons, this attenuated relationship does not raise serious doubts as to whether the FCC's interpretation makes the assessment an improperly delegated tax. See Rural Tel. Coalition v. FCC, 838 F.2d 1307, 1314 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (rejecting unconstitutional tax challenge to universal service support allocation finding).


96
 "The expression of one thing implies the exclusion of another." "Hence, a statute that mandates a thing to be done in a given manner . . . normally implies that it shall not be done in any other manner . . . ." 73 Am. Jur. 2d Statutes § 211 (1995).


97
 Ethyl Corp. v. EPA, 51 F.3d 1053, 1060 (D.C. Cir. 1995).


98
 The District of Columbia Circuit has upheld FCC actions under § 154(i) that require payments from parties even without express statutory authorization. See Mobile Communications Corp. of Am. v. FCC, 77 F.3d 1399 (D.C. Cir. 1996); New England Tel. & Tel. Co. v. FCC, 826 F.2d 1101 (D.C. Cir. 1987).


99
 See H. R. Conf. Rep. 104-458, at 133 (emphasis added), reprinted at 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 144.


100
 The FCC further concluded that its decision will ensure that schools and libraries can obtain discounted "state-of-the-art telecommunications technologies as those technologies become available." Order ¶ 433.


101
 The FCC's decision to prohibit carriers from recovering through intrastate rates does not save it from § 2(b) analysis. There is no question that the amount of a carrier's universal service contributions will increase with the inclusion of intrastate revenues. This cost, even if recovered only through interstate revenues, still constitutes a "charge in connection with intrastate service" under § 2(b).
If the point of § 2(b) was to protect state authority over intrastate service, allowing the FCC to assess contributions based on intrastate revenues could certainly affect carriers' business decisions on how much intrastate service to provide or what kind it can afford to provide. This federal influence over intrastate services is precisely the type of intervention that § 2(b) is designed to prevent.


102
 In its most recent action, the FCC reaffirmed its jurisdictional authority to require carriers to contribute based on both intrastate and interstate revenues. See Seventh Report and Order ¶¶ 87-90. In fact, the FCC appears to be awaiting a decision by this court before taking further action: "Accordingly, pending further resolution of this matter by the Fifth Circuit, the assessment base and recovery base for contributions to the high-cost and low-income universal service support mechanism that we adopted in the First Report and Order shall remain in effect." Seventh Report and Order ¶ 90. This invitation to judicial action further undercuts the FCC's ripeness defense.


103
 MCI has filed a supplemental brief rejecting this characterization. It relies on MCI Telecomm. Corp. v. Virginia State Corp. Comm'n, 11 F. Supp. 2d 669 (E.D. Va. 1998), vacated as moot, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 8749 (4th Cir. May 10, 1999) (unpublished), in which the court granted MCI's motion for injunctive relief from a Virginia state commission's order and ruling that MCI's disputed charges were not charges for intrastate calls. MCI also points to the FCC's recent order rejecting Virginia's administrative petition of the same issue. See Virginia State Corp. Comm'n v. MCI Telecomm. Corp., No. E-99-01.FCC 99-42 (released Mar. 22, 1999). This ruling actually supports the states' ripeness argument, however, because the district court's final order on this question, along with the FCC's recent order, further demonstrates the propriety of judicial review of this question.


104
 Having concluded that the FCC has no jurisdiction over intrastate rates for universal service purposes, we do not reach CBT's final argument challenging the agency's requirement that carriers recover their contributions solely from interstate revenues.

Before SMITH, DeMOSS AND STEWART, Circuit Judges.

PER CURIAM:*

       Sammy K. Shipman, Texas prisoner #583548, appeals the district court’s dismissal with

prejudice of his 42 U.S.C. § 1983 complaint as frivolous.               Shipman argues his arrest was

       *
           Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be
published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR.
R. 47.5.4.
unconstitutional because a pharmacist cannot dispense medication for the purpose of a police

investigation; the prosecutors, his defense counsel, and the clerk of court are not absolutely immune

from suit for monetary damages; the trial judge is not absolutely immune from suit for declaratory

and injunctive relief; the district court erred in denying his motion to amend his complaint; the district

court erred in finding his claims were barred by the statute of limitations; and the county is liable for

the acts of its officials who conspired to violate his constitutional rights. He has abandoned his claim

that the county is liable for keeping an “open file.” See Yohey v. Collins, 985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th

Cir. 1993).

        We review the district court’s dismissal of Shipman’s complaint as frivolous for an abuse of

discretion. Gonzales v. Wyatt, 157 F.3d 1016, 1019 (5th Cir. 1998). The dismissal of Shipman’s

claims for monetary, declaratory, and injunctive relief, based upon the defendants’ alleged conspiracy

to unconstitutionally arrest, convict, and imprison him, was not an abuse of discretion. See Heck v.

Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 486-87 (1994); Brandley v. Keeshan, 64 F.3d 196, 199 (5th Cir. 1995);

Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 488-90 (1973); see also Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 821

(1977). Moreover, as the claims sought to be raised in Shipman’s amended complaint were frivolous,

the failure of the district court to consider those claims was harmless. See FED. R. CIV. P. 15(a); FED.

R. CIV. P. 61; Heck, 512 at 486-87; Gonzales, 157 F.3d at 1019; TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE

ANN. § 16.003(a).

        Shipman’s appeal is without arguable merit and is DISMISSED as FRIVOLOUS. See

Howard v. King, 707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir. 1983); 5TH CIR. R. 42.2. The district court’s

dismissal of Shipman’s complaint under 28 U.S.C. § 1915 and this court’s dismissal of his appeal as

frivolous count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g). Adepegba v. Hammons, 103 F.3d 383, 388


                                                  -2-
(5th Cir. 1996). We caution Shipman that if he accumulates three “strikes” under 28 U.S.C. §

1915(g) he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated

or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. 28 U.S.C.

§ 1915(g). Shipman’s motion to expedite his appeal is DENIED.

       APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED; MOTION

DENIED.

MEMORANDUM BY LAZARUS, J.:                        FILED OCTOBER 02, 2015

        Bruce Kenneth Woods, Jr., appeals from his judgment of sentence,

imposed in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, after

entering an open guilty plea to third-degree murder (F-1),1 robbery (F-1),2

solicitation to commit perjury (F-3),3 and related offenses.    Woods was

sentenced to an aggregate term of 25-50 years’ imprisonment. After careful

review, we affirm on the basis of the opinion authored by the Honorable

Thomas C. Branca.

       In October 2010, on the streets of Norristown, Woods gunned down

the victim by firing multiple shots from a semiautomatic 9mm handgun.

Woods had agreed to murder the victim in exchange for $10,000 from his

co-conspirator, Tyuan Simon, who told Woods that the victim had “ratted

him out” to police.        Just moments before the “murder-for-hire,” Woods

assaulted a female victim, stealing her gun, which he then used to shoot the

victim.

       Woods signed a proffer with the Commonwealth, in which he provided

a detailed statement of his involvement in the victim’s murder in exchange

for the Commonwealth charging him with third-degree murder instead of

seeking the death penalty.4 Woods entered an open guilty plea to various

charges    and    was    sentenced      to     the   following   consecutive   terms   of

imprisonment:        17-34 years for third-degree murder; 6-12 years for

robbery; and 2-4 years for solicitation (perjury).5 Woods filed post-sentence

motions that were denied. This timely appeal followed.

       On appeal, Woods presents the following issues for our consideration:




____________________________________________


4
 The Commonwealth initially charged Woods with capital murder. See 18
Pa.C.S. § 2502(a).
5
  Woods also pled guilty to conspiracy to commit third-degree murder,
robbery (decedent), person not to possess a firearm, and simple assault.
Those sentences were ordered to run concurrent to the above-stated
charges.



                                             -2-
J-S51018-15


       (1)    Is a sentencing scheme of consecutive standard range
              sentences an abuse of discretion where said scheme is
              based on facts not of record?

       (2)    Did the sentencing court commit an abuse of discretion in
              failing to impose a mitigated sentencing scheme in light of
              Appellant’s     substantial    cooperation    with     the
              Commonwealth, his receipt of physical/verbal threats, and
              his horrendous life story?

       Based on the multiple crimes with which he was charged, Woods faced

a maximum aggregate sentence of 77-154 years’ imprisonment. Moreover,

if Woods chose to proceed to trial, imposition of the death penalty was a

possibility. Although the court ran Woods’ murder, robbery and solicitation

(perjury) sentences consecutively, each of these sentences was in the

standard range of the guidelines.          Additionally, the court chose to impose

concurrent sentences on the remaining five charges.6

       After carefully reviewing the parties’ briefs, the record on appeal, and

relevant case law, we affirm Woods’ judgment of sentence based upon the

well-written and thorough opinion authored by Judge Branca.           We instruct

the parties to attach a copy of Judge Branca’s decision in the event of

further proceedings in the matter.7
____________________________________________


6
   Woods simultaneously entered an open guilty plea to possession with
intent to deliver on a separate bill.
7
  While Woods’ claims challenging the court’s imposition of consecutive, non-
mitigated range sentences may not present a substantial question in some
cases, we find that his overarching claim that the court used improper facts
in imposing his sentence does invoke our appellate review of his claims.

of excessiveness of sentence due to consecutive nature of sentence will not

A preponderance of the evidence shows that the mother neglected the child by permitting the child to live in the home of a person she had never met and whose full name and address were unknown to her; failing to provide that person with documentation necessary for the child to receive dental treatment; failing to provide the child with financial support; and failing to act after learning that the child was homeless for several months (see Family Ct Act §§ 1012[f][i][A], [B]; 1046[b][i]; Matter of Kimberly F. [Maria F.], 146 AD3d 562 [1st Dept 2017], lv denied __ NY3d __, 2017 NY Slip Op 68601 [2017]; Matter of Joelle T. [Laconia W.], 140 AD3d 513, 513-514 [1st Dept 2016]). The mother's conduct and the testimony of the caseworkers demonstrated her clear intention to abdicate her parental responsibilities, despite her claims of illness and poverty (see Kimberly F., 146 AD3d at 563; Joelle T., 140 AD3d at 514).

No. 28598.
United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit.

Before BELL, COLEMAN and AINSWORTH, Circuit Judges.
AINSWORTH, Circuit Judge:


1
Central Distributors Inc.  (Central) commenced this Florida-based diversity action for breach of a license agreement against M.E.T., Inc. and Joseph L. Nellis in early 1965.  The case in different circumstances has already been before this Court twice, Central Distributors, Inc. v. M.E.T., Inc., 5 Cir., 1968, 403 F.2d 943; Nellis v. Fulton, 5 Cir., 1969 (No. 27917, June 3) (petition for writ of mandamus), and the merits of the dispute have at times been overlooked in a continuing quarrel about procedure.  M.E.T., Inc. is no longer a party.  Now, after five years, the issue of the measure of Nellis's liability to Central is presented to this Court.  The District Judge awarded Central $52,426.85, plus costs, and Nellis appeals.


2
Under the license agreement at issue, Central leased space and established a hardware store in a Hialeah, Florida, shopping center developed by M.E.T., Inc.  The agreement provided that the initial lease would extend from November 15, 1963, through November 30, 1966, and reserved to Central an option to terminate the agreement at the end of the first year's operation if the hardware store's gross retail sales amounted to less than $350,000.  In the event that Central elected to terminate on this basis, the agreement also provided that M.E.T., Inc. would purchase the store's fixtures and stock-in-trade.  Nellis executed a guaranty insuring M.E.T., Inc.'s performance regarding the purchases of fixtures and stock-in-trade from Central.


3
The store's total gross retail sales for the first year's operation amounted to less than $350,000 and Central elected to terminate the agreement.  After M.E.T., Inc. and Nellis failed to comply with Central's demand that they purchase the fixtures and stock-in-trade, Central conducted a going-out-of-business sale beginning in January 1965.  Central also filed this action for damages in the District Court.  Its complaint alleged that M.E.T., Inc. had refused to make the promised purchases and that Nellis had ignored demands made upon him as M.E.T., Inc.'s guarantor.  When Central completed the presentation of its case, the District Court granted M.E.T., Inc.'s motion for an order of dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) on the ground that Central had failed to introduce any competent evidence to sustain its burden of proving damages.  This Court reversed, stating:


4
'In the case before us, Central sought to introduce certain records in order to prove damages.  The exclusion of these records from evidence on the basis that they were not listed as exhibits in the pre-trial stipulation was critical and decisive.  This ruling, if allowed to stand, effectively bars a meaningful examination of the only real issues present.'


5
Central Distributors, Inc. v. M.E.T., Inc., 5 Cir., 1968, 403 F.2d 943, 946.


6
While this case proceeded at its snail's pace toward this Court for the first time, as the parties squabbled over procedure, Central retained possession of the fixtures.  Unable to sell the fixtures at a price satisfactory to it, Central first stored them in a warehouse in Miami, Florida.  Then, in the spring of 1966, the fixtures were shipped to a store operated by Central in Providence, Rhode Island.  Central erected and used the fixtures in that store until December 1967, when it went out of business at the Providence location.  On May 1, 1968, Central sold the fixtures to Mall Furniture Company, which took over the operation of the Providence store and used the fixtures in place.


7
After we remanded the case to the District Court, pettifoggery continued, as court time and lawyer time were devoted to Nellis's various motions for continuances, change of venue, and like matters.  The argument was complicated by the apparent inability of Nellis, himself a lawyer, to retain counsel to his liking who would be prepared for trial.  Finally, in June 1969, a trial to the court on the merits of the parties' dispute began.


8
The District Court determined that Nellis was liable to Central in the amount of $52,426.85.  It computed Central's damages as follows: (1) for the damages resulting from the failure to purchase the fixtures, Central was awarded $13,911.95; (2) for the failure to purchase the inventory, Central was awarded $20,935.84; (3) for other damages (closing expenses) caused by the breach of the license agreement, Central was awarded $6,492.90; (4) to the principal amount of damages, $41,340.69, the Court added interest calculated at 6 per cent from the date of breach, December 26, 1964, or $11,086.16.


9
We may not set aside the District Court's findings of fact unless these findings are clearly erroneous.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a); see, e.g., United States for Use and Benefit of Citizens National Bank of Orlando v. Stringfellow, 5 Cir., 1969, 414 F.2d 696; Chaney v. City of Galveston, 5 Cir., 1966, 368 F.2d 774.  Having considered all the evidence in this case, we are not left with the definite, firm conviction that a mistake has been committed in connection with the awarding of damages to Central for its losses on the inventory and its closing expenses.  Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court to the extent of these damages, $27,428.74, plus interest at 6 per cent from December 26, 1964, until paid.  See United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 394-395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 541-542, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948).  With respect to the damages awarded for Central's loss on the fixtures, however, we conclude that the judgment of the District Court must be reversed.  By its actions in connection with the fixtures after M.E.T., Inc. and Nellis had failed to purchase them, Central manifested its decision to retain the fixtures for its own use rather than to press for the vindication of any claim it might have had against M.E.T., Inc. or Nellis.  The record shows clearly that Central's sale of the fixtures to Mall Furniture Company, after these fixtures had been used by Central for approximately two years in its Providence store, was not an attempt to mitigate the damages occasioned by the breach of the license agreement, but was instead the culmination of a course of action taken independently of, and inconsistent with, prosecution of the claim against Nellis.


10
We have carefully considered Nellis's other contentions on this appeal and conclude that they are without merit.  Discussion of these contentions would serve only to add more words to a case already too filled with them.


11
The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.

MORROW
v.
THE STATE.
63208.
Court of Appeals of Georgia.
Decided April 6, 1982.
Rehearing Denied April 22, 1982.
Paul S. Weiner, for appellant.
Lewis R. Slaton, District Attorney, Joseph J. Drolet, H. Allen Moye, Paul Howard, Assistant District Attorneys, for appellee.
CARLEY, Judge.
Appellant was indicted, tried and convicted of incest. He appeals.
1. The trial court did not err, in the absence of a timely written request, in failing to charge that mere presence at the scene of the crime would not be sufficient to establish guilt. See Darden v. State, 171 Ga. 848, 862 (4) (157 SE 48) (1930); Burdett v. State, 159 Ga. App. 394 (1) (283 SE2d 622) (1981).
*184 2. In related enumerations of error, it is urged that appellant's conviction cannot stand because the trial court erred in not ordering, on its own motion, a hearing on the question of appellant's competency to stand trial.
"The issue of the accused's insanity at the time of the alleged crime is a question for the trial jury. The issue of the accused's competency to stand trial is a question for a special jury upon a special plea of insanity. Code Ann. § 27-1502. In either case, the question ultimately is whether the evidence supports the verdict. The issue of appellant's competency to stand trial was not submitted to a special jury because appellant's attorney did not file a special plea of insanity. Code Ann. § 27-1502. Absent a special plea of insanity there is no mandatory duty on the trial judge to impanel a special jury to determine that issue. However, the United States Supreme Court has held that the failure to observe procedures adequate to protect an accused's right not to be tried or convicted while incompetent to stand trial deprives him of his due process right to a fair trial. Pate v. Robinson, 383 U. S. 375 (86 SC 836) (1966). This also is a question of evidence. As stated in Drope v. Missouri, 420 U. S. 162, 174 (95 SC 896) (1974), `. . . the dispute concerns the inferences that were to be drawn from the undisputed evidence and whether, in light of what was then known, the failure to make further inquiry into petitioner's competence to stand trial denied him a fair trial.'" Ricks v. State, 240 Ga. 853, 854-855 (242 SE2d 604) (1978).
Thus, the issue of appellant's "mental competency" "does not involve any issue of insanity. [Cit.] . . . `Mental competence' relates only to the ability of the defendant, at the time of the trial, to intelligently participate in his trial ..." Echols v. State, 149 Ga. App. 620, 623 (255 SE2d 92) (1979). The issue " `is not, whether the defendant can distinguish between right and wrong, but is, whether he is capable at the time of the trial of understanding the nature and object of the proceedings going on against him and rightly comprehends his own condition in reference to such proceedings, and is capable of rendering his attorneys such assistance as a proper defense to the indictment preferred against him demands.'" Crawford v. State, 240 Ga. 321, 326 (240 SE2d 824) (1977).
The application of the above stated legal principles to the instant case demonstrates no error in the trial court's failure to order, on its own motion, a hearing on appellant's competency. Our independent review of the transcript indicates nothing "suggesting incompetence which came to light during trial." Drope, 420 U. S. at 179, supra. The evidence at trial relied upon by appellant as demonstrating an "inference" of incompetency does "not approach the bizarre conduct of the accuseds in Pate and Drope, supra." Ricks, *185 240 Ga. at 855, supra.
Appellant also relies upon the fact that the trial court, after hearing evidence during the sentencing phase of the case, observed that appellant was "at least limitedly sick" and made "psychiatric treatment while incarcerated and upon release" a special condition of the sentence imposed. The statement by the trial court is not "evidence" of appellant's incompetency. The issue on appeal is not whether appellant was, for purposes of sentencing, "sick" in the opinion of the trial court but whether, for purposes of due process, he was "mentally incompetent" to stand trial. It is evident that the trial court in the instant case, having heard the evidence relevant to the question of appellant's guilt of incest and to the issue of the sentence that should be imposed therefor, made an observation which did not reflect on appellant's competency to stand trial. The trial court merely stated that appellant was "sick" and entered a sentence accordingly. Thus, from the record before us, it appears that the procedures followed in the instant case in no way resulted in a deprivation of appellant's due process right to a fair trial but in fact resulted in the imposition of a sentence ostensibly more appropriate for one who, though guilty of a crime, is "sick." The observation by the trial court in sentencing appellant and the "evidence" apparently evoking that statement simply do not demonstrate that "`the failure to make further inquiry into petitioner's competence to stand trial denied him a fair trial.' " Ricks, 240 Ga. at 855, supra. Accordingly, we find no error.
Judgment affirmed. Quillian, C. J., and Shulman, P. J., concur.

See 470 U.S. 1039, 105 S.Ct. 1414.
On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.
The petition for writ of certiorari is denied.
Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting.


1
"There is no higher duty of a court, under our constitutional system, than the careful processing and adjudication of petitions for writs of habeas corpus, for it is in such proceedings that a person in custody charges that error, neglect, or evil purpose has resulted in his unlawful confinement and that he is deprived of his freedom contrary to law."  Harris v. Nelson, 394 U.S. 286, 292, 89 S.Ct. 1082, 1087, 22 L.Ed.2d 281 (1969).  Because the proceedings in this case have fallen intolerably short of fulfilling this duty, and because this Court must be vigilant in ensuring that lower courts do not improperly cut corners in administering the Great Writ, I respectfully dissent from the Court's denial of certiorari.


2
* The petitioner Harold Vincent was convicted in 1974 of armed robbery and second-degree murder by a jury in Vernon Parish, Louisiana.  Vincent's trial had been delayed for over two years while he underwent evaluation and treatment for schizophrenia. This mental illness was so severe that psychiatrists at the Louisiana State Penitentiary General Hospital had certified that Vincent did not meet the constitutional standard of triability in that he could neither "realiz[e] the nature of the charges against him" nor properly "assist his attorney."  1 Record 17, 18.  After intensive treatment with psychotropic drugs, particularly Thorazine, these psychiatrists notified the trial court that, so long as Vincent remained on his regulated dosage, he would have the mental capacity to proceed with trial.  Id., at 18.  They emphasized at Vincent's pretrial sanity hearing that Vincent was dependent on Thorazine and that it was "almost a sure thing" that he would revert to episodes of psychosis if he stopped taking the medication.  Id., at 64;  see also id., at 20-23.


3
According to Vincent's subsequent habeas petition, which Vincent prepared with the assistance of an inmate paralegal:


4
"On July 6, 1974, petitioner was transferred from the


5
Louisiana State Penitentiary to Vernon Parish without any of      his medication.  Petitioner immediately inquired with Vernon      Parish officials about his medication, but no one seemed to know anything about it.      Consequently, on the morning trial was scheduled to commence,      petitioner intentionally cut his leg to get to the hospital      to see someone about receiving some Thorozine [sic].  When he      appeared in court with his pants leg rolled up and a rag      wrapped around his lower leg, petitioner's mother and sisters      became upset and rushed to talk with him.  After petitioner      told them the reason he cut his leg, they talked with      petitioner's trial attorneys, William E. Tilley and Chris      Smith, III, concerning the likelihood of petitioner receiving      some Thorozine [sic].  Petitioner's attorneys brought the      matter to the attention of the trial court, and after a few      preliminary motions were argued, Judge Terrell ordered Vernon      Parish officials to bring petitioner to the hospital.


6
"Petitioner was taken to the Leesville General Hospital      where his leg was bandaged and he was given a shot.      Petitioner explained his condition to the doctor that treated      him, but was informed that it was against hospital      regulations to prescribe Thorozine [sic] to him.  Petitioner      was returned to the courthouse for continuation of the      proceedings against him.  Throughout his trial . . .      petitioner was without his prescribed medication, Thorozine      [sic].  He was convicted as charged and . . . sentenced to a      term of life imprisonment."  Id., at 9-10.


7
Vincent claimed that, as a result of this alleged deprivation of Thorazine, he was "mentally incompetent" during the trial in that he was unable "to maintain his ability to consult with his attorney and understand the proceedings against him."  Id., at 10.


8
After Vincent filed his federal habeas petition, the District Court ordered the State to submit a response.  Ten months passed before the State, prompted by the court's threat summarily to grant the petition, see id., at 36, finally filed an answer.  The State denied Vincent's material allegations and, in the alternative, asserted that "[a]ssuming the facts to be as alleged by the defendant he knew exactly what he was doing in an attempt to get the medication that he desired" and thereby manifested his competence.  Id., at 44-45, 57.


9
Without holding an evidentiary hearing or otherwise inquiring into the merits of Vincent's allegations beyond reviewing the trial record, the District Court summarily dismissed the petition.  Id., at 64-65.  The court reasoned that "[t]he alleged lack of Thorazine, the alleged self mutilation, and the alleged trip to the hospital were occurances [sic] that were never brought to the trial Judge's attention and are not reflected in the transcript record";  that the medical testimony concerning Vincent's likely relapse in the absence of his medication pertained "to the time of the offense and not at the time of the trial";  and that Vincent's counsel had not raised the issue at trial or on direct review. Ibid.  "In short, there is nothing in the record, beyond the defendant's assertion, of any lack of medication or the adverse effects from the lack therefrom."  Id., at 64.  The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed in a brief unpublished order, reasoning that Vincent's "proof" did not "reach the level required" to secure habeas relief.  Id., at 86.

II

10
There can be no doubt that, if Vincent was in fact deprived of his Thorazine during trial and this deprivation rendered him incompetent to stand trial, he is entitled to have his conviction vacated.  "[T]he conviction of an accused person while he is legally incompetent violates due process," Pate v. Robinson, 383 U.S. 375, 378, 86 S.Ct. 836, 838, 15 L.Ed.2d 815 (1966), and a petitioner is not barred from raising this issue by his failure to have challenged his competence at trial, id., at 384, 86 S.Ct., at 841.1  See also Drope v. Missouri, 420 U.S. 162, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975);  Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960);  Bishop v. United States, 350 U.S. 961, 76 S.Ct. 440, 100 L.Ed. 835 (1956).  Yet the Court today refuses to disturb the lower courts' summary dismissal of Vincent's petition for failure of proof even though Vincent has never been accorded an opportunity to adduce evidence in support of his allegations.  This result is squarely at odds with our precedents, with 28 U.S.C. § 2254, and with the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in the United States District Courts.


11
Where a habeas petition sets forth "specific and detailed factual assertions" that, if true, would entitle the petitioner to relief, the court must ensure the full development of the relevant facts.  Machibroda v. United States, 368 U.S. 487, 496, 82 S.Ct. 510, 514, 7 L.Ed.2d 473 (1962);  see also Harris v. Nelson, 394 U.S., at 300, 89 S.Ct., at 1091.  "Where the facts are in dispute, the federal court in habeas corpus must hold an evidentiary hearing if the habeas applicant did not receive a full and fair evidentiary hearing in a state court, either at the time of the trial or in a collateral proceeding."  Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 312, 83 S.Ct. 745, 756, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963). See also 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).  This duty requires "careful consideration and plenary processing of [habeas] claims including full opportunity for presentation of the relevant facts."  Harris v. Nelson, supra, 394 U.S., at 298, 89 S.Ct., at 1090.  Particular care is of course required where the habeas petitioner, as here, appears pro se or through the help of a fellow prisoner rather than with the assistance of an attorney.


12
Although a well-pleaded habeas petition frequently will require an evidentiary hearing, we have long recognized that federal courts may employ intermediate factfinding procedures in determining whether a full hearing is necessary.  See, e.g., Machibroda v. United States, supra, 368 U.S., at 495, 82 S.Ct., at 514.  Thus the Habeas Corpus Rules provide that the court may order limited discovery, 28 U.S.C. § 2254 Rule 6;  "direct that the record be expanded by the parties by the inclusion of additional materials relevant to the determination of the merits of the petition," Rule 7(a);2  or arrange for informal conferences to inquire further into the merits of the petition, Advisory Committee's Note to Habeas Corpus Rule 8, 28 U.S.C., p. 356.  See also 28 U.S.C. §§ 2246, 2247.  Similarly, the court may direct the petitioner, on pain of dismissal, to specify the witnesses and evidence he relies upon.  See, e.g., Smith v. Balkcom, 660 F.2d 573, 575, n. 2, 585, n. 33 (CA5 1981), modified, 671 F.2d 858, mandate recalled, 677 F.2d 20, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 882, 103 S.Ct. 181, 74 L.Ed.2d 148 (1982).  Although the particular procedures must necessarily vary with the circumstances of each case, the underlying concern is consistent:  "where specific allegations before the court show reason to believe that the petitioner may, if the facts are fully developed, be able to demonstrate that he is confined illegally and is therefore entitled to relief, it is the duty of the court to provide the necessary facilities and procedures for an adequate inquiry."  Harris v. Nelson, supra, 394 U.S., at 300, 89 S.Ct., at 1091.


13
Vincent's claims have never even been addressed through a state evidentiary hearing, and the duty of the District Court to give full and fair consideration to them was therefore particularly clear.  See, e.g., Townsend v. Sain, supra, 372 U.S., at 313-314, 83 S.Ct., at 757.  None of the justifications proffered by the court or the State can excuse the court's summary dismissal of Vincent's petition.  The court asserted, for example, that there is nothing in the transcript record suggesting that Vincent had acted irrationally or had otherwise been incompetent during trial.  1 Record 65.  However, we have consistently rejected the notion that the absence of such evidence in the transcript can alone obviate the need for an evidentiary hearing on the issue of the petitioner's mental capacity at trial.  See, e.g., Drope v. Missouri, supra, 420 U.S., at 179, 95 S.Ct., at 907;  Pate v. Robinson, supra, 383 U.S., at 386, 86 S.Ct., at 842 ("While [petitioner's] demeanor at trial might be relevant to the ultimate decision as to his sanity, it cannot be relied upon to dispense with a hearing on that very issue").  Similarly, the court emphasized that Vincent's attorneys had failed to raise the issue of his possible incompetence at trial.  1 Record 64.  Again, however, while this failure might well be evidence indicating that Vincent was not incompetent, it could just as well reflect his attorneys' unfamiliarity with the gravity of the situation or the ineffectiveness of their assistance;  the ultimate truth cannot be determined in the absence of further inquiry.


14
The heart of the court's summary rejection of Vincent's petition appears to be that there is "nothing in the trial transcript" proving that Vincent was without his Thorazine during trial, mutilated himself in an attempt to obtain Thorazine, or would have reverted to his former incompetence if in fact he really were deprived of Thorazine.  Ibid.  Yet the alleged incidents occurred before the trial actually began, and the absence of supporting evidence in the transcript therefore obviously does not disprove Vincent's claim.  Indeed, one of the fundamental purposes of federal habeas factfinding is to determine the truth of "purported occurrences outside the courtroom and upon which the record could, therefore, cast no real light." Machibroda v. United States, supra, 368 U.S., at 494-495, 82 S.Ct., at 513-514.  See also Hawk v. Olson, 326 U.S. 271, 274, 66 S.Ct. 116, 118, 90 L.Ed. 61 (1945).  In the proper exercise of its responsibilities under the Habeas Corpus Rules, the District Court easily could have sought independent verification of Vincent's allegations from prison and hospital records, and from inquiries directed to Vincent's former attorneys, prison officials, and Vincent's family.3  Moreover, if the court had doubts about the effect of Thorazine deprivation on Vincent's capacity to stand trial, it should have directed Vincent's doctors to address the issue.4  These procedures might well have demonstrated that Vincent's petition was without merit.  If such discovery revealed substance in Vincent's allegations, however, then an evidentiary hearing would be essential to determine whether his conviction was unconstitutionally procured.


15
The District Court emphasized that, under pertinent Fifth Circuit precedent, a habeas petitioner alleging that he was incompetent to stand trial must demonstrate facts that " 'positively, unequivocally, and clearly generate the real, substantial, and legitimate doubt' " as to his mental capacity to assist in his defense.  1 Record 65, quoting Bruce v. Estelle, 483 F.2d 1031, 1043 (CA5 1973).  Although this standard may be perfectly appropriate, § 2254 and its attendant Rules forbid the invocation of the standard before a petitioner has been given the opportunity to present his supporting evidence.5  Where, as here, there is undisputed evidence that a habeas petitioner suffered from longstanding and severe mental illness, had previously been found unfit to stand trial as a result of his disorders, and would "almost [as] a sure thing" suffer a relapse if deprived of his medication, 1 Record 64, a court may not dismiss his claim that he was so deprived without inquiring into the merits or warning him that his petition would be dismissed if further substantiating evidence was not presented.6  "The Government's contention that his allegations are improbable and unbelievable cannot serve to deny him an opportunity to support them by evidence.  On this record it is his right to be heard."  Walker v. Johnston, 312 U.S. 275, 287, 61 S.Ct. 574, 579, 85 L.Ed. 830 (1941).

 As summarized in Vincent's petition for certiorari, "[t]he facts alleged by Vincent that would be corroborated by outside sources include:
"1. Thorazine not being sent with Vincent from Angola. Verification:  Prison Records.
"2. Vincent cut his leg to get to hospital to request thorazine.  Verification:  Leesville General Hospital records; Police Jury payment records;  William E. Tilley, Chris Smith, III, Della Vincent, Brenda Carlin.
"3. Vincent made requests of jail officials, his attorneys and family for thorazine.  Verification:  Vernon Parish police officers, William E. Tilley, Chris Smith, III., Della Vincent, Brenda Carlin. . . ."  Pet. for Cert. 7.


4
 The District Court acknowledged that prison psychiatrists had testified at Vincent's sanity hearing that it was "almost a sure thing" that Vincent would revert to episodes of psychosis if deprived of Thorazine.  1 Record 64.  Incredibly, the court dismissed the relevance of this testimony by observing that the psychiatrists' discussion related to Vincent's condition at the time of the offense "and not at the time of the trial."  Ibid.  We have long recognized the probity of prior medical opinion on issues of trial competence, see, e.g., Drope v. Missouri, 420 U.S. 162, 180, 95 S.Ct. 896, 908, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975), and the psychiatrists' predictions in this case made further inquiries imperative.


5
 Bruce v. Estelle, relied on by the District Court below, itself illustrates this principle.  After finding that Bruce had demonstrated "a history of mental illness" and "substantial evidence of mental incompetence at or near the time of trial," the Fifth Circuit concluded that an evidentiary hearing was required to resolve Bruce's claim of incompetence at trial.  483 F.2d, at 1043.  "We would thus be remiss in our duty if we turned a deaf ear to petitioner's contentions since the record in this case evidences proceedings which did not adequately permit him to fairly present his serious allegations."  Ibid.


6
 The District Court never notified Vincent that his petition was subject to dismissal for want of sufficient evidence. Yet the Habeas Corpus Rules require such fair warning.  Rule 11 commands the federal courts to apply the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure "to the extent that they are not inconsistent with these rules."  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) in turn provides that, if the court considers entering judgment for reasons beyond the bare sufficiency of the pleadings, "all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion."  See generally Stephens v. Kemp, 469 U.S. 1043, 1057, 105 S.Ct. 530, 540, 83 L.Ed.2d 417 (1984) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting).


324 F.3d 1088
Roderick Courtney MANN, Plaintiff-Appellant,v.AMERICAN AIRLINES, Defendant-Appellee.
No. 01-35803.
United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit.
Argued and Submitted March 5, 2003.
Filed April 1, 2003.

Douglas R. Cloud, Tacoma, WA, for appellant Roderick C. Mann.
Kenneth R. O'Brien and Brandon Blevans, Littler Mendelson, Sacramento, CA, for appellee American Airlines, Inc.
Appeal from the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington; Franklin D. Burgess, District Judge, Presiding. D.C. No. CV-00-05641-FDB.
Before: REINHARDT, W. FLETCHER, and GOULD, Circuit Judges.
GOULD, Circuit Judge.


1
Plaintiff-Appellant Roderick C. Mann filed a civil action within the governing statute of limitations but then did not serve process within 120 days of filing, as required (absent time extension) by Fed. R.Civ.P. 4(m). Mann then moved for an extension of time to serve Defendant-Appellee American Airlines, was granted additional time by the district court, and effected service within the judicially extended time. We consider (1) whether the failure to serve process within the initial 120-day period causes the statute of limitations to run again and (2) whether the district court may extend the time to serve process, under Rule 4(m), after the 120 days have expired when the statute of limitations would otherwise bar the refiling of the suit if the district court had declined extension of time and had dismissed the suit.


2
* Mann received a "right-to-sue" letter from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) on August 2, 2000, and filed a pro se complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington eighty-nine days later on October 30, 2000. His complaint alleged a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101. The original filing of this complaint was within the 90-day statute of limitations period set forth in 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1).


3
Because Mann did not serve the complaint on Defendant Appellee American Airlines within the 120-day period required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m), the district court on March 27, 2001, issued an "Order to Show Cause Why Case Should Not Be Dismissed." Mann retained counsel, filed a Response to the Order to Show Cause through counsel, and moved for extension of time to serve the complaint. By minute order dated May 8, 2001, the district court granted the motion for extension, giving Mann until June 8, 2001, to complete service.


4
On May 30, 2001, Mann filed an amended complaint and the district court issued a summons. On June 4, 2001, Mann served on Defendant American Airlines the original complaint, the amended complaint, the original summons, and the subsequent summons.


5
American Airlines later moved to dismiss pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(5) and (b)(6), alleging inadequate and untimely service of process and lack of personal jurisdiction. The district court granted the motion and dismissed the case with prejudice, apparently believing that compliance with the statute of limitations as provided by 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1) is linked to service of process within the 120-day period set out in Rule 4(m):


6
In this case, plaintiff's original complaint was timely filed, on the 89th day of the 90 day period. Filing a complaint gives a plaintiff 120 days to complete service of process according to Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m). In this case plaintiff failed to timely serve and ex parte moved the court for an extension of time to complete service, which the court granted. While the court has discretion with regards to service of process, the court does not have the power to alter the 90 day statute of limitations. Wilson v. Grumman Ohio Corp., 815 F.2d 26, 27 (6th Cir.1987). Plaintiff's failure to file suit against American [Airlines] within the 90 day period mandated by the ADA requires the court to dismiss.


7
(Emphasis added.) Mann appeals.

II

8
The correctness of the district court's dismissal on statute of limitations grounds is a question of law reviewed de novo. See Underwood Cotton Co., Inc. v. Hyundai Merch. Marine (Am.), Inc., 288 F.3d 405, 407 (9th Cir.2002). The interpretation of a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure is also a question of law reviewed de novo. See United States v. Foster, 227 F.3d 1096, 1099 (9th Cir.2000).

III

9
This appeal requires resolution of two issues. First, we address whether Mann's failure to serve process within the initial 120-day period prescribed by Fed. R.Civ.P. 4(m) caused the statute of limitations to start to run again. We conclude that it did not. Once a complaint is filed, the statute of limitations is tolled unless and until the district court dismisses the action. See 4 Charles A. Wright and Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 3d § 1053 (3d ed. 2002).1


10
Second, we address whether the district court had the discretion to extend the time to serve process even after the 120-day period had expired. We conclude that it did. Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m) provides:


11
If service of the summons and complaint is not made upon a defendant within 120 days after the filing of the complaint, the court, upon motion or on its own initiative after notice to the plaintiff, shall dismiss the action without prejudice as to that defendant or direct that service be effected within a specified time; provided that if the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure, the court shall extend the time for service for an appropriate period.2


12
On its face, Rule 4(m) does not tie the hands of the district court after the 120-day period has expired. Rather, Rule 4(m) explicitly permits a district court to grant an extension of time to serve the complaint after that 120-day period. Cf. Henderson v. United States, 517 U.S. 654, 661, 116 S.Ct. 1638, 134 L.Ed.2d 880 (1996) (concluding that "the 120-day provision operates not as an outer limit subject to reduction, but as an irreducible allowance").


13
The district court's discretion is not diminished when the statute of limitations would bar re-filing of the suit if the district court decided to dismiss the case instead of grant an extension. To the contrary, the advisory committee notes explicitly contemplate that a district court might use its discretion to grant an extension in that very situation: "Relief may be justified, for example, if the applicable statute of limitations would bar the re-filed action." Fed.R.Civ.P. 4, Advisory Committee Note to 1993 Amendments, Subdivision (m). See also De Tie v. Orange Cty., 152 F.3d 1109, 1111 n. 5 (9th Cir.1998) (recognizing that an extension may be warranted if the statute of limitations has run).


14
Here, even though the district court properly used its discretion to extend the time for Mann to serve process, the district court later dismissed the action after concluding the statute of limitations had not been satisfied. As there was no other apparent basis, we must assume that the district court believed that the statute of limitations began to run upon Mann's failure to serve process within the 120-day period.3 But the failure to serve process within Rule 4(m)'s 120-day period does not affect the tolling of the statute of limitations unless the failure to serve process causes the district court to dismiss the action. Cf. Henderson, 517 U.S. at 656, 116 S.Ct. 1638 (holding that once a federal suit is commenced in compliance with the governing statute of limitations, "the manner and timing of serving process are generally nonjurisdictional matters of `procedure'"); Pardazi v. Cullman Med. Ctr., 896 F.2d 1313, 1315-16 (11th Cir.1990) (holding that service of process requirements are not bound up with the statute of limitations under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1)). The district court did not dismiss Mann's action but rather extended the 120 day service of process period, a decision perfectly within its discretion.4


15
Having concluded that the district court's dismissal of this case was error, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.


16
REVERSED and REMANDED.



Notes:


1
 Neither party disputes that Mann filed his complaint within the 90-day statute of limitations. And, neither party disputes that the statute of limitations initially is tolled upon filing of a complaintSee Sain v. City of Bend, 309 F.3d 1134, 1138 (9th Cir.2002).


2
 Rule 4(m) replaced former Rule 4(j) in the 1993 amendments. The current rule requires a district court to grant an extension of time if good cause is shown and permits the district court to grant such an extension even absent good causeHenderson v. United States, 517 U.S. 654, 662, 116 S.Ct. 1638, 134 L.Ed.2d 880 (1996). This differs from former Rule 4(j), which did not permit extensions absent good cause. Id. at 661-62, 116 S.Ct. 1638.


3
 The district court's reliance onWilson v. Grumman Ohio Corp., 815 F.2d 26 (6th Cir. 1987), is misplaced in part because that case concerned the re filing of a complaint after it had already been dismissed by the district court for failure to prosecute.

 We reject Defendant's claims that the grant of a 30-day extension was prejudicial

Appeals from the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas.
Before CLARK, FAY and VANCE, Circuit Judges.
VANCE, Circuit Judge.


1
Howard Carroll and Robert Wilson were convicted on charges of making fraudulent and misleading statements in the offer and sale of securities, and with having aided and abetted in using the United States mails to further the fraud.  15 U.S.C. §§ 77q(a), 77x; 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 1341.  In addition, those appellants, along with co-defendant Jerry McFarland, were found guilty under a count alleging a conspiracy to commit enumerated offenses in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.  The convictions involve acts committed during the public sale of stock in Coal Creek Mining Company, which was controlled by appellants.  Prospective investors were told that the proceeds would be used to develop mining properties for the production of coal.  Instead, the $212,741 raised by the stock offering was used to purchase real estate, to run a trucking firm owned by McFarland, and to pay Carroll, Wilson and McFarland for various expenses incurred.  None of the funds were ever used for the stated purpose.


2
On appeal Carroll and Wilson present a multitude of contentions, including claims that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the convictions, improper voir dire of the jury, as well as error in the jury instructions.1  Carroll further argues that the trial judge abused her discretion in denying his motion for continuance.  The sole issue presented by McFarland is whether plain error resulted from the trial court's sua sponte amendment of Count 1, the conspiracy count.  We affirm as to appellants Carroll and Wilson.  The conviction of McFarland is reversed.

Jury Instructions as to Count 1

3
Count 1 is the only count under which McFarland was convicted.  It alleges a conspiracy to violate federal securities2 and postal3 laws.  The trial court incorrectly instructed the jury that the offenses which defendants were charged with conspiring to commit included not only the two stated in the indictment but also violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2314 prohibiting the interstate transportation of fraudulently obtained money.4  Count 1 does not charge McFarland with conspiracy to violate that particular section.


4
The fifth amendment guarantees "(n)o person shall be held to answer for (an) . . .  infamous crime, unless on (an) . . .  indictment of a Grand Jury . . . ."  The central purpose of this requirement is


5
to limit (the accused's) jeopardy to offenses charged by a group of his fellow citizens acting independently of either prosecuting attorney or judge.


6
Stirone v. United States, 361 U.S. 212, 218, 80 S.Ct. 270, 273, 4 L.Ed.2d 252 (1960).  Accord, United States v. Cox, 342 F.2d 167 (5th Cir.), Cert. denied, 381 U.S. 935, 85 S.Ct. 1767, 14 L.Ed.2d 700 (1965).  By describing the crime charged, the indictment also insures that the accused will be adequately informed of the charges against him and that he will be protected against double jeopardy.  Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974), United States v. Fischetti, 450 F.2d 34 (5th Cir. 1971), Cert. denied, 405 U.S. 1016, 92 S.Ct. 1290, 31 L.Ed.2d 478 (1972); United States v. Haldeman, 181 U.S.App.D.C. 254, 559 F.2d 31 (1976).


7
These essential functions are so fundamental that the procedure used to obtain an indictment must be strictly followed in order to insure a fair trial for the accused.  The requirement is not met where, as here, an instruction has the effect of amending5 the indictment by charging an extraneous crime in a conspiracy count.  In Ex Parte Bain, 121 U.S. 1, 7 S.Ct. 781, 30 L.Ed. 849 (1887), the Supreme Court proscribed amending an indictment by any means other than through the grand jury itself:


8
(I)f it be once held that changes can be made by the consent or the order of the court in the body of the indictment as presented by the grand jury, and the prisoner can be called upon to answer to the indictment as thus changed, the restriction which the constitution places upon the power of the court, in regard to the prerequisite of an indictment, in reality no longer exists.


9
Id. at 13, 7 S.Ct. at 788.  See Stirone v. United States, supra.


10
Although McFarland had an absolute right to have the jury instructed solely on charges contained in the indictment, he did not seasonably object to the improper instruction as is required by Fed.R.Crim.P. 30.  That rule, however, is modified by Rule 52(b), which provides that "(p)lain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court."


11
The government concedes that the challenged instruction was erroneous, but urges that in the face of what it contends to be overwhelming evidence of guilt and in the absence of a timely objection there was no fundamental unfairness which would warrant our setting the conviction aside.  We conclude, however, that the trial court's error in instructing the jury that they may find McFarland guilty of conspiracy to violate section 2314 requires our intervention.  Although errors that are constitutional in nature may not be plain error per se, Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); United States v. Bates, 512 F.2d 56 (5th Cir. 1975), "there are some constitutional rights so basic to a fair trial that their infraction can never be treated as harmless . . . ."  386 U.S. at 23, 87 S.Ct. at 827-28.  The right of a defendant to be tried under an indictment presented solely by a grand jury is one such right.  Ex Parte Bain excluded the notion of a non-prejudicial amendment to the indictment, and since that time, the concept of harmless error has not been applied to amendments.  Gaither v. United States, 134 U.S.App.D.C. 154, 413 F.2d 1061 (1969).  Because the trial court committed plain error in instructing the jury with respect to the only charge of which he was found guilty, we reverse as to McFarland.

Denial of Continuance

12
Appellant Carroll complains of prejudice resulting from the trial court's denial of his motions for continuance.  Disposition of such motions is vested in the sound discretion of the trial court.  Its ruling will not be disturbed on appeal, except upon a clear showing of abuse.  Avery v. Alabama,308 U.S. 444, 60 S.Ct. 321, 84 L.Ed. 377 (1940); United States v. Uptain,531 F.2d 1281 (5th Cir. 1976); United States v. Moriarty, 497 F.2d 486 (5th Cir. 1974).  Whether such abuse will be found is to be decided on a "case by case basis in light of the circumstances presented."  531 F.2d at 1285.  The reviewing court will especially examine the reasons for continuance given at the time the request is denied.  Ungar v. Sarafite, 376 U.S. 575, 84 S.Ct. 841, 11 L.Ed.2d 921 (1964); McKinney v. Wainwright, 488 F.2d 28 (5th Cir.), Cert. denied, 416 U.S. 973, 94 S.Ct. 1998, 40 L.Ed.2d 562 (1974).


13
Two grounds were asserted by Carroll to support his motion for continuance: insufficient time for full and adequate preparation of the defense, and a conflict in the commitments of Carroll's attorney, who was scheduled to try a case in a Colorado state court on an unrelated matter the same day appellant's trial was to have begun in Dallas.


14
This court has established several factors to be considered in evaluating claims of inadequate preparation time.  Some of them include the amount of time available for preparation, the likelihood of prejudice resulting from denial, the complexity of the case, and the adequacy of the defense actually provided at trial.  United States v. Uptain, supra, at 1286.


15
Applying these criteria to the present case, we find that the denial of continuance did not constitute an abuse of discretion.  From the time that his firm was first contacted by Carroll, counsel had almost six weeks to get ready for trial.  There were also numerous recesses granted during trial which extended actual preparation time.  Carroll shows no area which he would have investigated further or in which his counsel would have been better prepared had he been allowed additional time for preparation.


16
Carroll's attorney revealed a conflicting commitment for the first time six days before trial, and was allowed to withdraw.  Withdrawal, however, was predicated upon Carroll's having counsel at trial, and permitted with the understanding that the withdrawal would not delay the proceedings.  See generally, United States v. Dilworth, 524 F.2d 470 (5th Cir. 1975); United States v. Sexton, 473 F.2d 512 (5th Cir. 1973).  The attorney was ordered to appear on behalf of Carroll when it became apparent that such defendant otherwise would be unrepresented at trial.  In Uptain we held, "(W)here there is a substantial basis for a continuance, the attorney should present the claim as early as possible."  531 F.2d at 1290-1291.  When the conflict in question was first mentioned in defendant's second motion for continuance, the government witnesses had been subpoenaed, and at least one of the co-defendants, McFarland, was ready to proceed.


17
Despite the denial of the motions for continuance, Carroll was ably and effectively represented at trial.  The record discloses that his attorney was well acquainted with the facts of the case, and thoroughly cross-examined the witnesses.  He clearly met the standard for effective assistance of counsel mandated by the sixth amendment.  See United States v. Simpson, 460 F.2d 1321 (5th Cir. 1972).


18
We are unable to conclude that the ruling of the district court was not a "reasonable resolution of the various factors confronting (it)."  531 F.2d at 1291.  We therefore must uphold the lower court's action even though we may view its ruling as a harsh one.

Sufficiency of Evidence

19
Wilson and Carroll contend that the evidence is insufficient to sustain convictions on the conspiracy, securities fraud, and mail fraud counts of the indictment.  The test for sufficiency is whether "reasonable minds could conclude that the evidence is inconsistent with the hypothesis of the accused's innocence."  United States v. Warner, 441 F.2d 821, 825 (5th Cir.), Cert. denied, 404 U.S. 829, 92 S.Ct. 65, 30 L.Ed.2d 58 (1971).  On appeal the determination is to be made in the light most favorable to the government.  Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942).


20
It was not unreasonable for a jury to find appellants guilty as charged.  Carroll and Wilson were responsible for forming the mining corporation and arranging for the public sale of its stock.  Together they selected Harry Niles to run the corporation as a "front man," while they retained actual control of the company.6  Appellants contacted the underwriter for the public offering of the corporate stock and caused a circular to be made to promote the sale.  This prospectus, which was distributed through the United States mails, contained several misstatements of fact.  In particular, the circular represented that the Securities and Exchange Commission and the corporation's shareholders would be notified of the facts and circumstances surrounding any proposed use of uncommitted corporate funds prior to actual disposition.  Such notification was never given, even though uncommitted funds were used to purchase real estate in Texas.  At least one investor testified that he purchased shares in the mining company in reliance on that representation.  Additionally, appellants arranged for their names not to appear in the circular as promoters of the corporation, and represented that Mr. Niles was the majority stock owner when in fact Carroll and Wilson were the true owners.


21
These acts support a guilty verdict not only on the substantive counts, but also on the conspiracy charge.  Although appellants complain there was no hard evidence of the conspiracy agreement, direct proof is not required.  United States v. Netterville, 553 F.2d 903 (5th Cir. 1977), Cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1009, 98 S.Ct. 719, 54 L.Ed.2d 752 (1978).  Complicity may be inferred from the circumstances.  United States v. Warner, supra.  The circumstantial evidence produced at trial overwhelmingly supports a finding that appellants conspired to commit securities and mail fraud.

Voir Dire

22
Appellants Carroll and Wilson also assign as error the trial judge's refusal to examine prospective jurors on questions submitted by defense counsel and her failure to voir dire the venire individually.  This is another area in which the trial court has considerable discretion and with respect to which its decision will not be lightly overturned.  United States v. Rojas, 537 F.2d 216 (5th Cir. 1976), Cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1061, 97 S.Ct. 785, 50 L.Ed.2d 777 (1977); United States v. Eastwood, 489 F.2d 818 (5th Cir. 1973); United States v. Bearden, 423 F.2d 805 (5th Cir.), Cert. denied, 400 U.S. 836, 91 S.Ct. 73, 27 L.Ed.2d 68 (1970); Pinkney v. United States, 380 F.2d 882 (5th Cir. 1967), Cert. denied, 390 U.S. 908, 88 S.Ct. 831, 19 L.Ed.2d 876 (1968).


23
The trial judge in this case refused to give each of the inquiries submitted by defense counsel.  She covered substantially all of the proposed questions, however, and indicated that she would reconsider any omitted question brought to her attention.  Refusal under such circumstances could not have affected the basic fairness of appellant's trial.  See Ham v. South Carolina, 409 U.S. 524, 93 S.Ct. 848, 35 L.Ed.2d 46 (1973); Aldridge v. United States, 283 U.S. 308, 51 S.Ct. 470, 75 L.Ed. 1054 (1931); United States v. Eastwood, supra; United States v. Gassaway, 456 F.2d 624 (5th Cir. 1972).


24
We perceive no basis for concluding that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to examine each potential juror individually.  Appellants have shown no prejudice resulting from the procedure used, and we have found none.


25
Instruction Concerning Guilt of Participants in Fraudulent Sale


26
Finally, Carroll and Wilson argue that the district court improperly instructed the jury that a person may be guilty of securities fraud if he Participated in the offer and sale of the stock.  They contend that only offerors and sellers may be found guilty under the statute.  The charge given was not erroneous.  Section 77q(a) of title 15 U.S.C. states that it is unlawful for Any person in the offer and sale of securities to defraud or to obtain money through material misrepresentations.  Clearly the section is not limited solely to offerors and sellers, but extends also to those who are parties to the fraud.  This result was reached in Buie v. United States, 420 F.2d 1207 (5th Cir. 1969), Cert. denied, 398 U.S. 932, 90 S.Ct. 1830, 26 L.Ed.2d 97 (1970).  There, this court found that "participation alone is sufficient to sustain a conviction for mail and securities fraud . . . ."  Id. at 1209.


27
Having fully considered Wilson and Carroll's contentions and finding no error, we affirm their convictions.


28
AFFIRMED AS TO CARROLL AND WILSON, REVERSED AS TO McFARLAND.

 Appellants also raise as errors the failure to grant a motion for severance, the failure of the government to make exculpatory evidence available, and various evidentiary irregularities.  We have considered each of these contentions but find them to be without merit

4
 In addition to the oral instructions, the charge in written form apparently was sent with the jury into the jury room during its deliberations


5
 An amendment to the indictment is to be distinguished from a mere variance between the indictment and proof adduced
An Amendment of the indictment occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are altered, either literally or in effect, by prosecutor or court after the grand jury has last passed upon them.  A Variance occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are left unaltered, but the evidence offered at trial proves facts materially different from those alleged in the indictment.

OPINION AND ORDER
THOMAS M. ROSE, District Judge.
The first private foreclosure action based upon federal diversity jurisdiction was filed in this Court on February 9, 2007. Since then, twenty-six (26) additional complaints for foreclosure based upon federal diversity jurisdiction have been filed.

STANDING AND SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION
While each of the complaints for foreclosure pleads standing and jurisdiction, evidence submitted either with the complaint or later in the case indicates that standing and/or subject matter jurisdiction may not have existed at the time certain of the foreclosure complaints were filed. Further, only one of these foreclosure complaints thus far was filed in compliance with this Court's General Order 07-03 captioned "Procedures for Foreclosure Actions Based On Diversity Jurisdiction."


*653 Standing

Federal courts have only the power authorized by Article III of the United States Constitution and the statutes enacted by Congress pursuant thereto. Bender v. Williamsport Area School District, 475 U.S. 534, 541, 106 S.Ct. 1326, 89 L.Ed.2d 501 (1986). As a result, a plaintiff must have constitutional standing in order for a federal court to have jurisdiction. Id.
Plaintiffs have the burden of establishing standing. Loren v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Michigan, 505 F.3d 598, 606-07 (6th Cir.2007). If they cannot do so, their claims must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Id (citing Central States Southeast & Southwest Areas Health and Welfare Fund v. Merck-Medco Managed Care, 433 F.3d 181, 199 (2d Cir.2005)).
Because standing involves the federal court's subject matter jurisdiction, it can be raised sua sponte. Id. (citing Central States, 433 F.3d at 198). Further, standing is determined as of the time the complaint is filed. Cleveland Branch, NAACP v. City of Parma, Ohio, 263 F.3d 513, 524 (6th Cir.2001), cert. denied 535 U.S. 971, 122 S.Ct. 1438, 152 L.Ed.2d 382 (2002). Finally, while a determination of standing is generally based upon allegations in the complaint, when standing is questioned, courts may consider evidence thereof. See NAACP, 263 F.3d at 523-30; Senter v. General Motors, 532 F.2d 511 (6th Cir.1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 870, 97 S.Ct. 182, 50 L.Ed.2d 150 (1976).
To satisfy Article III's standing requirements, a plaintiff must show: (1) it has suffered an injury in fact that is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant; and (3) it is likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. Loren, at 606-07.
To show standing, then, in a foreclosure action, the plaintiff must show that it is die holder of the note and the mortgage at the time the complaint was filed. The foreclosure plaintiff must also show, at the time the foreclosure action is filed, that the holder of the note and mortgage is harmed, usually by not having received payments on the note.

Diversity Jurisdiction
In addition to standing, a court may address the issue of subject matter jurisdiction at any time, with or without the issue being raised by a party to the action. Community Health Plan of Ohio v. Mosser, 347 F.3d 619, 622 (6th Cir.2003). Further, as with standing, the plaintiff must show that the federal court has subject matter jurisdiction over the foreclosure action at the time the foreclosure action was filed. Coyne v. American Tobacco Company, 183 F.3d 488, 492-93 (6th Cir.1999). Also as with standing, a federal court is required to assure itself that it has subject matter jurisdiction and the burden is on the plaintiff to show that subject matter jurisdiction existed at the time the complaint was filed. Id. Finally, if subject matter jurisdiction is questioned by the court, the plaintiff cannot rely solely upon the allegations in the complaint and must bring forward relevant, adequate proof that establishes subject matter jurisdiction. Nelson Construction Co. v. U.S., 79 Fed.Cl. 81, 84-85 (Fed.Cl.2007) (citing McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance Corp. of Indiana, 298 U.S. 178, 56 S.Ct. 780, 80 L.Ed. 1135 (1936)); see also Nichols v. Muskingum College, 318 F.3d 674, (6th Cir.2003) ("in reviewing a 12(b)(1) motion, the court may consider evidence outside the pleadings to resolve factual disputes concerning jurisdiction . . . ").
*654 The foreclosure actions are brought to federal court based upon the federal court having jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332, termed diversity jurisdiction. To invoke diversity jurisdiction, the plaintiff must show that there is complete diversity of citizenship of the parties and that the amount in controversy exceeds $7000. 28 U.S.C. § 1332.

Conclusion
While the plaintiffs in each of the above-captioned cases have pled that they have standing and that this Court has subject matter jurisdiction, they have submitted evidence that indicates that they may not have had standing at the time the foreclosure complaint was filed and that subject matter jurisdiction may not have existed when the foreclosure complaint was filed. Further, this Court has the responsibility to assure itself that the foreclosure plaintiffs have standing and that subject-matter-jurisdiction requirements are met at the time the complaint is filed. Even without the concerns raised by the documents the plaintiffs have filed, there is reason to question the existence of standing and the jurisdictional amount. See Katherine M. Porter, Misbehavior and Mistake in Bankruptcy Mortgage Claims 3-4 (November 6, 2007), University of Iowa College of Law Legal Studies Research Paper Series Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract-1027961 ("[H]ome mortgage lenders often disobey the law and overreach in calculating the mortgage obligations of consumers. . . . Many of the overcharges and unreliable calculations . . . raise the specter of poor recordkeeping, failure to comply with consumer protection laws, and massive, consistent overcharging.")
Therefore, plaintiffs are given until not later than thirty days following entry of this order to submit evidence showing that they had standing in the above-captioned cases when the complaint was filed and that this Court had diversity jurisdiction when the complaint was filed. Failure to do so will result in dismissal without prejudice to refiling if and when the plaintiff acquires standing and the diversity jurisdiction requirements are met. See In re Foreclosure Cases, No. 1:07CV2282, et al., 2007 WL 3232430 (N.D.Ohio Oct. 31, 2007) (Boyko, J.)

COMPLIANCE WITH GENERAL ORDER 07-03
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 83(a)(2) provides that a "local rule imposing a requirement of form shall not be enforced in a manner that causes a party to lose rights because of a nonwillful failure to comply with the requirement." Fed.R.Civ.P. 83(a)(2). The Court recognizes that a local rule concerning what documents are to be filed with a certain type of complaint is a rule of form. Hicks v. Miller Brewing Company, 2002 WL 663703 (5th Cir.2002). However, a party may be denied rights as a sanction if failure to comply with such a local rule is willful. Id.
General Order 07-03 provides procedures for foreclosure actions that are based upon diversity jurisdiction. Included in this General Order is a list of items that must accompany the Complaint.[1] Among the items listed are: a Preliminary Judicial Report; a written payment history verified by the plaintiff's affidavit that the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000; a legible copy of the promissory note and any loan modifications, a recorded *655 copy of the mortgage; any applicable assignments of the mortgage, an affidavit documenting that the named plaintiff is the owner and holder of the note and mortgage; and a corporate disclosure statement. In general, it is from these items and the foreclosure complaint that the Court can confirm standing and the existence of diversity jurisdiction at the time the foreclosure complaint is filed.

Conclusion
To date, twenty-six (26) of the twenty-seven (27) foreclosure actions based upon diversity jurisdiction pending before this Court were filed by the same attorney. One of the twenty-six (26) foreclosure actions was filed in compliance with General Order 07-03. The remainder were not.[2] Also, many of these foreclosure complaints are notated on the docket to indicate that they are not in compliance. Finally, the attorney who has filed the twenty-six (26) foreclosure complaints has informed the Court on the record that he knows and can comply with the filing requirements found in General Order 07-03.
Therefore, since the attorney who has filed twenty-six (26) of the twenty-seven (27) foreclosure actions based upon diversity jurisdiction that are currently before this Court is well aware of the requirements of General Order 07-03 and can comply with the General Order's filing requirements, failure in the future by this attorney to comply with the filing requirements of General Order 07-03 may only be considered to be willful. Also, due to the extensive discussions and argument that has taken place, failure to comply with the requirements of the General Order beyond the filing requirements by this attorney may also be considered to be willful.
A willful failure to comply with General Order 07-03 in the future by the attorney who filed the twenty-six foreclosure actions now pending may result in immediate dismissal of the foreclosure action. Further, the attorney who filed the twenty-seventh foreclosure action is hereby put on notice that failure to comply with General Order 07-03 in the future may result in immediate dismissal of the foreclosure action.
This Court is well aware that entities who hold valid notes are entitled to receive timely payments in accordance with the notes. And, if they do not receive timely payments, the entities have the right to seek foreclosure on the accompanying mortgages. However, with regard the enforcement of standing and other jurisdictional requirements pertaining to foreclosure actions, this Court is in full agreement with Judge Christopher A Boyko of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio who recently stressed that the judicial integrity of the United States District Court is "Priceless."

ORDER

1
Defendant Cummins appealed from the district court's order of October 20, 1987, which ordered him detained pending trial.  The government responded in opposition.


2
Cummins is scheduled to go on trial November 30, 1987 on charges of receipt and possession of unregistered firearms, being a felon in receipt and possession of firearms and using threats and intimidation to influence another in connection with an official proceeding.  The United States magistrate conducted a hearing pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3142(f) and ordered Cummins detained pending trial.  The district court, by order of October 20, 1987, affirmed, finding that Cummins presented a threat to the safety of other persons and to the community and a risk of flight if released.  Cummins timely appealed.


3
Cummins contends that he should have been released pending trial upon the conditions that he refrain from the use of alcohol and narcotic drugs, avoid contact with witnesses and be monitored by the appropriate agencies to guarantee his compliance.  To detain him upon a determination of dangerousness, he contends, is an unconstitutional punishment before trial.  He also maintains that he is not a risk of flight.


4
We will not disturb the factual findings of the district court and magistrate in pretrial hearings unless we determine those findings to be clearly erroneous.    See United States v. Hazime, 762 F.2d 34, 37 (6th Cir.1985).  Based upon the evidence presented in the hearing specifically authorized by section 3142(f), it does not appear to us that it was clearly erroneous for the district court and magistrate to determine that the facts are such as to warrant detention of Cummins pending trial.  Pretrial detention under the Bail Reform Act of 1984 is regulatory in nature, moreover, and does not constitute punishment before trial in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.    United States v. Salerno, --- U.S. ----, 107 S.Ct. 2095 (1987).  Accordingly,


5
It is ORDERED that the October 20, 1987 order of the district court is affirmed.

Martin P. MARSTON
v.
R. M. OLIVER, Superintendent of the Virginia State Farm.
No. 272-69-R.
United States District Court, E. D. Virginia, Richmond Division.
March 10, 1971.
*692 James L. Sanderlin, Richmond, Va., for petitioner.
Overton P. Pollard, Asst. Atty. Gen., of Virginia, Richmond, Va., for respondent.

MEMORANDUM
MERHIGE, District Judge.
Martin Marston petitions this Court for a writ of habeas corpus relieving him from the effects of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Chesterfield County.
When he filed the petition, Marston was confined in the Virginia State Farm by the respondent. Pertinent facts about his criminal conviction have been stipulated:
On February 24, 1969, Martin P. Marston, on a plea of guilty, was found guilty of driving on a suspended operator's license by the County Court of Chesterfield County, Virginia, and sentenced to one year imprisonment and $1,000 fine. From this sentence, Marston appealed and requested assistance of counsel on the appeal to the Circuit Court of Chesterfield County, Virginia. This request was denied. On May 27, 1969, on a plea of not guilty, Marston was found guilty by a jury and sentenced to 12 months in jail and a $100 fine.
During the period of his imprisonment Marston filed a petition for habeas corpus challenging the denial of counsel. Thereafter on October 23, 1969, Marston was released from state custody. Subsequently, on January 6, 1970, Marston was barred from operating a vehicle on the highways of the State of Virginia for a period of ten years, having come under the provisions of Virginia Code § 46.1-387.1 et seq., as a result of the conviction in the Circuit Court of Chesterfield County, Virginia, on May 27, 1969.
In addition to the factual stipulation, a plenary hearing revealed his indigency at the time of his request to the state court for assistance of counsel.
The question presented is whether the petitioner's sentence to imprisonment for twelve months cannot stand by reason of the refusal to afford him appointed counsel.

Mootness
The case is not moot. Marston is now released from detention, but his conviction has given rise to the very real civil disability of ten years' withdrawal of his driving permit. In the record is the prosecutor's information which initiated the proceedings which resulted in this disability. One of the convictions listed in support of the claim that the petitioner is an "habitual offender" is that of May 27, 1969, attacked herein. Collateral prejudicial consequences, therefore, actually flow from the judgment here contested. Consequently the petitioner's release during the pendency of these proceedings does not moot his case. Sibron v. New York, 392 U.S. 40, 50-58, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1968); Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U.S. 234, 88 S.Ct. 1556, 20 L.Ed.2d 554 (1968); Wood v. Ross, 434 F.2d 297 (4th Cir. 1970); Hewett v. State of North Carolina, 415 F.2d 1316, 1320-1322 (4th Cir. 1969).

Exhaustion of state remedies
Marston did not take any direct appeal, nor have any collateral proceedings been initiated in state courts. For two reasons, however, he is not obliged to seek relief in such forums.
First, the state habeas corpus procedure is not currently available to him. The Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals recently ruled that a prisoner whose sentences expired before a decision could be reached on his habeas corpus petition no longer presented the court with a litigable case:
Our habeas corpus statutes are designed to provide relief in the form of the "discharge" (Code § 8-603) from the "person in whose custody" (Code § 8-598) a petitioner is "detained without lawful authority" (Code § 8-596).
*   *   *   *   *   *

*693 The petitioner is no longer detained and there is no custody from which to discharge him. To pass upon the merits of his claims would be to render an advisory opinion  a function our habeas corpus statutes neither provide for nor permit. This court, therefore, is without jurisdiction further to entertain the case, and the appeal will be dismissed. Blair v. Peyton, 210 Va. 416, 171 S.E.2d 690, 691 (1970).
There is no indication that the petitioner has deliberately bypassed state procedures by his failure to file a state habeas case while he was confined. Assuming that some prisoner might ever be so resolute in his efforts to avoid state procedures as to file only a federal petition and then await the expiration of his term to press for a ruling, this has not been Marston's strategy. That no intentional forfeiture of known avenues of relief has been made is plain if one considers the second reason for which exhaustion is not now necessary.
Whether or not Virginia courts might now afford Marston a forum to litigate his constitutional claims, recent actions of the state's highest court make it manifest that the prevailing constitutional doctrine in the state system is not in accord with his claims. Resort to state courts would be futile. In such circumstances it is not required. Ralph v. Warden, 438 F.2d 786 n. 1 (4th Cir. 1970); Rowe v. Peyton, 383 F.2d 709 (4th Cir. 1967) affirmed, Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U.S. 54, 88 S.Ct. 1549, 20 L.Ed.2d 420 (1968); Patton v. North Carolina, 381 F.2d 636 (4th Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 390 U.S. 905, 88 S.Ct. 818, 19 L.Ed.2d 871 (1968); Evans v. Cunningham, 335 F.2d 491 (4th Cir. 1964).
Recently the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals denied two original petitions for habeas corpus by misdemeanor convicts who went to trial without counsel.
In Hackette v. Royster, R 9863, mem. decis. (Va.Sup.Ct.App., June 19, 1969), a habeas petitioner had been tried for two violations of Va.Code § 6.1-115 (1966 Repl.Vol.), the offense of passing bad checks, which carries a maximum sentence of twelve months, Va.Code §§ 18.1-101, 18.1-9 (1960 Repl.Vol.). The state supreme court appointed counsel to brief the issues, which principally involved denial of the right to appeal and refusal to appoint counsel. It is clear, therefore, that the original habeas petition was considered on its merits, as the Supreme Court of Appeals does on occasion. Va.Code § 17-97 (1960 Repl. Vol.); Burgess v. Cunningham, 205 Va. 623, 139 S.E.2d 110 (1964); see Taylor v. Cox, No. 14, 108, mem. decis. (4th Cir., Apr. 22, 1970); McLaughlin v. Royster, Civil Action No. 5667-R, mem. decis. (E.D.Va. Jan. 13, 1971).
Hackette's request for counsel's aid allegedly had been denied in the court not of record where he was tried. He pleaded guilty and allegedly sought to appeal. The guilty plea would not, under Virginia law, have precluded his contesting all issues in the de novo trial in a court of record afforded to appellants. Va.Code § 16.1-132 (1960 Repl.Vol.). His attorney specifically argued the applicability of Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963) to Hackette's case.
A procedural question arose as to whether the Supreme Court of Appeals should or could remand to a lower court for the determination of unrecorded matters of fact raised in the pleadings. See Va.Code §§ 8-596, 8-598 (1957 Repl.Vol., Supp.1970). The respondent had not denied, however, that the petitioner was not represented by counsel nor was he offered court-appointed counsel. Under Virginia pleading principles, allegations not denied are accepted as true. Morris v. Smyth, 202 Va. 832, 120 S.E.2d 465 (1961). Whether or not conclusive court records were available to settle the factual issues of offer or waiver of counsel's assistance, and whether or not a hearing to determine those questions could be conducted, it would appear that the state of the pleadings in Hackette left no facts material to the issue in dispute, and that the legal question of the duty to provide counsel *694 in cases such as Hackette's alone remained. The dismissal of the petition consequently constituted a ruling on the merits adverse to the petitioner. Rowe v. Peyton, supra, offers a close analogy:
[Rowe's] petition was rejected by the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia without an opinion, but in light of the factual allegations of the petition, that rejection must have been upon the procedural ground that Rowe was not presently serving the sentence he seeks to attack. Thacker should not be required to travel the same road through the state courts to present a question which the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals has so recently decided, when there is no indication that it is now prepared to depart from the former course of its decisions. Rowe v. Peyton, supra, 383 F.2d at 711 (footnotes omitted).
Carter v. Gathright, R 9840, mem. decis. (Va.Sup.Ct.App., June 17, 1969), is a similar case. Carter alleged that he asked the sheriff for an attorney before his county court trial. His request was denied. Responsive pleadings made no denial but stated ambiguously that "petitioner being tried for misdemeanors was not entitled as a matter of right * * * to counsel of his own choosing." The writ was denied in this case as well. Carter had faced two misdemeanor charges, each of which carried a maximum penalty of a year's confinement.
In view of these recent rulings of the state's highest court resolving the very issue which Marston raises here adversely to his contentions, it would be senseless, even if a state forum would consider his claim on the merits, to require him to seek relief there.

Right to counsel
Marston was, at the time of his trial in the court not of record and at the time of his de novo retrial, financially unable to retain counsel. He had $35.00 available for his use in the first instance and no money at all the second time. The circuit court made no inquiry as to his financial status, despite that he did request counsel's aid.
In view of Marston's request for counsel, it is obvious that he did not waive whatever rights he had. Nor did the petitioners who sought relief from the state supreme court in original habeas cases, for it has long been the law that a failure to request a lawyer's aid does not constitute an effective waiver:
The purpose of the constitutional guaranty of a right to counsel is to protect an accused from conviction resulting from his own ignorance of his legal and constitutional rights, and the guaranty would be nullified by a determination that an accused's ignorant failure to claim his rights removes the protection of the Constitution. Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 465, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938).
The United States Supreme Court has not yet held that a defendant charged with a misdemeanor is entitled to counsel at state expense when he cannot afford his own. Opportunities for such a decision have arisen, but the Court has not found it appropriate, in those instances, to resolve the issue. DeJoseph v. Connecticut, 385 U.S. 982, 87 S.Ct. 526, 17 L.Ed.2d 443 (1966), cert. denied; Winters v. Beck, 385 U.S. 907, 87 S.Ct. 207, 17 L.Ed.2d 137 (1966), cert. denied; but see Patterson v. Warden, Maryland Penitentiary, 372 U.S. 776, 83 S.Ct. 1103, 10 L.Ed.2d 137 (1963). Of course no significance as to the merits of a particular contention can be attributed to a denial of certiorari.
Despite the lack of a Supreme Court holding in point, the opinion in Gideon v. Wainwright, supra, which involved a felony conviction, is not qualified by language restricting it to felony prosecutions, or to cases wherein the defendant faces or receives a particular penalty:
Not only these precedents but also reason and reflection require us to recognize that in our adversary system of criminal justice, any person haled into court, who is too poor to hire a lawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial unless *695 counsel is provided for him. This seems to us to be an obvious truth. Governments, both state and federal, quite properly spend vast sums of money to establish machinery to try defendants accused of crime. Lawyers to prosecute are everywhere deemed essential to protect the public's interest in an orderly society. Similarly, there are few defendants charged with crime, few indeed, who fail to hire the best lawyers they can get to prepare and present their defenses. That government hires lawyers to prosecute and defendants who have the money hire lawyers to defend are the strongest indications of the widespread belief that lawyers in criminal courts are necessities, not luxuries. The right of one charged with crime to counsel may not be deemed fundamental and essential to fair trials in some countries, but it is in ours. From the very beginning, our state and national constitutions and laws have laid great emphasis on procedural and substantive safeguards designed to assure fair trials before impartial tribunals in which every defendant stands equal before the law. This noble ideal cannot be realized if the poor man charged with crime has to face his accusers without a lawyer to assist him. Gideon v. Wainwright, supra, 372 U.S. 344, 83 S.Ct. 796 (emphasis supplied).
Gideon, whether it establishes a constitutional right to counsel in all criminal cases or a right which exists only when an indigent defendant faces something over a certain minimum penalty, requires that defendants in Marston's position be afforded counsel's assistance.
In this instance the criminal charge was not complex. From the prosecutor's point of view it might have been a case almost impossible to lose. The facts of the case might, however, have raised issues concerning the suspended status of Marston's license or his knowledge thereof. Counsel would have been necessary to identify and explore these issues. This Court does not rely, however, on any particular finding of prejudice, any "special circumstances" which imposed upon the state court the duty of appointing counsel for this indigent. For one thing, it is all too easy for the bench and the bar to dismiss certain cases as simple ones; we fail to perceive the judicial process as do laymen with less or different education. "That which is simple, orderly, and necessary to the lawyer  to the untrained layman  may appear intricate, complex, and mysterious." Johnson v. Zerbst, supra, 304 U.S. at 463, 58 S.Ct. at 1022. The material facts of a case may be simple, but the means to establish them may be beyond the lay defendant. Untutored in the law of evidence, he may forfeit a valid defense by neglecting to summon the requisite witnesses or present the proper documentary proof.
Furthermore, approaching the issue with utmost realism, the Court believes that the greatest service which counsel may render in many cases is that of negotiating with his opposite number for a guilty plea to a reduced charge. "In many, or even most, cases, the only defense available is the determination and nerve of the defense attorney," Brown v. Peyton, 435 F.2d 1352 (4th Cir. 1970). A lay defendant cannot be expected to embark on such dealings unaided. Plea bargaining requires open discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each side's case and a confident awareness of the consequences of alternative strategies. Without a lawyer, a defendant may be unconscious even of the opportunity to commence such discussions, and he certainly will be constrained in his conduct thereof. "Counsel, or effective waiver thereof, is a sine qua non of permissible plea bargaining." Grades v. Boles, 398 F.2d 409 (4th Cir. 1968). To deny an indigent a legal representative is effectively to deny him the power to bargain at all.
Moreover, in nearly every context in which courts have concluded that counsel's services are essential to due process, they have abandoned any requirement that prejudice be specifically *696 shown. This reflects the realistic view that a lawyer's function is to discover legal and factual issues and to use available procedures to further the interests of his client at each stage of the prosecution, and that it is nearly impossible to reconstruct after the fact the likely course of a trial, had counsel played a role. A defendant wrongly denied counsel normally, then, is given the opportunity in a new trial to demonstrate how counsel would have served him, concurrently with a redetermination of his guilt. Prejudice from the prior denial is presumed. Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 23, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); Gideon v. Wainwright, supra; Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U.S. 52, 55, 82 S.Ct. 157, 7 L.Ed.2d 114 (1961); Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 75-76, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); Hewett v. State of North Carolina, supra, 415 F.2d 1325; compare Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1, 90 S.Ct. 1999, 26 L.Ed.2d 387 (1970). Our court of appeals has held that when a defendant has been denied the aid of a lawyer loyal exclusively to his interests, "the possibility of harm is sufficient to render his conviction invalid." Sawyer v. Brough, 358 F.2d 70, 73 (4th Cir. 1966).
This Court has concluded that at least when a layman faces possible imprisonment for twelve months, whatever the label of his offense, due process requires that he have the opportunity to defend himself by counsel. The distinction between felonies and misdemeanors is only a matter of designations applied by state law; federal constitutional rights do not hinge on such superficialities. The consequences of a misdemeanor conviction may well be more serious than those flowing from many felony convictions. Imprisonment under conditions similar to those to which felons are subjected may ensue. Any incarceration of over thirty days, more or less, will usually result in loss of employment, with a consequent substantial detriment to the defendant and his family. The essential nature of the right to counsel in other nonfelony cases where such substantial consequences are possible has received recognition. In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967). No logical justification exists for drawing any distinction between Marston's misdemeanor case and that of an indigent felony defendant.
In other circuits indigent misdemeanor defendants have been held entitled to counsel when arraigned or tried. The Fifth Circuit so ruled as early as 1965 in Harvey v. State of Mississippi, 340 F.2d 263 (5th Cir. 1965), a case involving a 90 day day jail term. A district court in the Second Circuit held in 1966 that one faced with a one year term was tried for an offense carrying a "substantial prison sentence" and therefore was due counsel under Gideon, Arbo v. Hegstrom, 261 F.Supp. 397 (D.Conn. 1966). The Eighth Circuit likewise has ruled that at least in some circumstances a misdemeanant must have a lawyer's aid; particularly important to that court in considering whether due process so requires is the possible penalty the defendant faces. Beck v. Winters, 407 F.2d 125 (8th Cir. 1969). See also, Shepherd v. Jordan, 425 F.2d 1174 (5th Cir. 1970); James v. Headley, 410 F.2d 325 (5th Cir. 1969); Goslin v. Thomas, 400 F.2d 594 (5th Cir. 1968); Wilson v. Blabon, 370 F.2d 997 (9th Cir. 1967); McDonald v. Moore, 353 F.2d 106 (5th Cir. 1965); Brinson v. Florida, 273 F. Supp. 840 (S.D.Fla.1967); Rutledge v. Miami, 267 F.Supp. 885 (S.D.Fla.1967). Recently the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals ruled that the assistance of counsel was required, under Gideon, for an indigent misdemeanor defendant facing a possible jail term of six months. Moats v. Janco, 8 Cr.L. Rptr. 2285 (Jan. 14, 1971) (opinion subsequently withdrawn on rehearing, 180 S.E.2d 74 (1971)).
This Court will not attempt now to fashion a standard determining exceptions, if any, to the duty to appoint counsel in cases involving lesser potential penalties than that which Marston faced. The Supreme Court has been able to fix *697 guidelines, in terms of possible sentence, establishing the applicability of the sixth amendment right to jury trial. Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968). The right to counsel may, however, be considered essential to due process even in cases where the right to jury trial does not attach. It seems plain, however, that the thrust of Gideon leaves only one possible factor of significance in determining whether a right to the services of counsel exists: whether the offense carries "the possibility of a substantial prison sentence." Gideon v. Wainwright, supra, 372 U.S. at 351, 83 S.Ct. at 801 (Harlan, J., concurring). "The Court has come to recognize, in other words," Mr. Justice Harlan notes elsewhere, "that the mere existence of a serious criminal charge constituted in itself special circumstances requiring the services of counsel at trial. In truth the Betts v. Brady [316 U.S. 455, 62 S.Ct. 1252, 86 L.Ed. 1595 (1942)] rule is no longer a reality." Id. The extent of any minimum potential penalty which might invoke the Gideon rule is matter for later decision. At this time it is necessary only to decide that, under the unqualified language of Gideon as well as Mr. Justice Harlan's interpretation of that holding, due process required that Marston be granted a lawyer's assistance at critical stages of his case.
The Court is aware of the existence of a divergent ruling in this district, Hackette v. Royster, Misc. No. 359-60-N, mem. decis. (E.D. Va. May 22, 1970), but notes its respectful dissent, for the reasons stated, from the view that particular prejudice must be shown to have flowed from the lack of counsel.
Apropos of the precept expressed in Hackette, supra, it appears to this Court that the lack of counsel at the very least tends to deter one from exercising the right of trial by jury. Laymen undoubtedly are, in most instances, at a disadvantage in their ability to deal with the selection of a jury encompassing their right of challenge for cause, etc. The lack of procedural knowledge may in itself give rise to a chilling effect in the exercise of a basic constitutional right. In addition, as a practical matter, judges trained to separate the inadmissible from the admissible of necessity are less lenient in evidentiary rulings when a jury sits than when the fact finding burden falls upon them. This fact, it seems to the Court, assuming the defendant overcomes the initial chilling effect arising from the need to select a jury without, except in rare instances, any knowledgeable conception of the entire procedure, gives rise to the probability of a defendant being prejudiced by his inability to propound questions and to testify in such a way as to conform to the rules concerning the fact finding inquiry.
Because Marston has been released from his jail term, the Court, guided by Hewett v. State of North Carolina, supra, 415 F.2d at 1325, shall issue the writ declaring the conviction invalid. The petitioner should have no difficulty, the Court assumes, in hereafter gaining relief from such collateral consequences as have flowed in part from his invalid conviction. Because his sentence is fully served, Marston may not be further incarcerated for the acts for which he was tried and convicted. Because the state has a substantial interest, however, in imposing disabilities on those who may have committed such offenses as Marston was charged with, it would be inappropriate for the Court to bar a retrial, if conducted within a reasonable time. Compare Wood v. Ross, supra, 434 F.2d at 300.
An order shall issue consistent with this opinion.

285 F.2d 703
John Franklin TAYLOR, Appellant,v.UNITED STATES of America, Appellee.
No. 16726.
United States Court of Appeals Ninth Circuit.
Dec. 12, 1960.

J. B. Tietz, Los Angeles, Cal., for appellant.
Laughlin E. Waters, U.S. Atty., Robert John Jensen, Wm. Bryan Osborne, Asst. U.S. Attys., Los Angeles, Cal., for appellee.
Before CHAMBERS, STEPHENS, POPE, BARNES, HAMLEY, HAMLIN, JERTBERG, MERRILL and KOELSCH, Circuit Judges.
BARNES, Circuit Judge.


1
This appeal has been determined in part by a unanimous court.  Reference is hereby made to the general discussion and recital of facts, and to the first four questions common to all defendants and determined in that decision entitled Johnson v. United States, 9 Cir., 285 F.2d 700.  We incorporate the portion of that opinion applicable to the appellant Taylor in this opinion.  We consider here the two questions peculiar to the Taylor appeal alone.


2
The first is the board's failure to reopen the matter of Taylor's classification.


3
Taylor sent the draft board information that he had become a 'vacationpioneer' which is part-time ministerial work and which may lead to full-time ministerial work.  Taylor did not request that the classification be reopened.  He advised, but did not request.  The point has already been decided adversely to appellant by our ruling in Shaw v. United States, 9 Cir., 1959,264 F.2d 118.  We decline to overrule that decision.


4
The next question raised by Taylor alone is alleged error in sentencing procedure.


5
Appellant Taylor urges that Rule 32(a), Fed.R.Crim.P., 18 U.S.C.A., was not followed in his case.  This rule, in material part, reads:


6
'Before imposing sentence the court shall afford the defendant an opportunity to make a statement in his own behalf and to present any information in mitigation of punishment.'


7
There is a difference of opinion in the several circuits as to whether the word 'shall' in this rule means 'must.'  In Couch v. United States, 1956, 98 U.S.App.D.C. 292, 235 F.2d 519, 521, the District of Columbia Circuit held it was the better practice to advise the convicted person of his right to make a personal statement in his own behalf, but applied their interpretation prospecitively only, refusing to reverse the conviction.  And see Gadsden v. United States, 1955, 96 U.S.App.D.C. 162, 223 F.2d 627.


8
The First Circuit in Green v. United States, 1 Cir., 1959, 273 F.2d 216, 217, refused to follow the District of Columbia Circuit.  But it is noted that the First Circuit did it on the facts of that case, where counsel had had full oppotunity to speak 'and has spoken at length for his client in mitigation of punishment.'  Id., 273 F.2d at page 217.  Certiorari granted April 18, 1960, 362 U.S. 949, 80 S.Ct. 867, 4 L.Ed.2d 867.


9
Other circuits have refused to follow the rule literally where there has been waiver by counsel, Kennedy v. United States, 5 Cir., 1958, 259 F.2d 883, 886, certiorari denied 359 U.S. 994, 79 S.Ct. 1126, 3 L.Ed.2d 982, or where nothing can be accomplished by allocution.  United States v. Galgano (United States v. Carminati), 2 Cir., 1960, 281 F.2d 908.  And see Yaich v. United States, 9 Cir., 1960, 283 F.2d 613 (petition for rehearing denied).


10
The government urges that Taylor was 'represented at every stage of the proceedings' by counsel of his choice; that a defendant must choose between having representation or 'handling matters completely on his own.'


11
We cannot agree.  The words 'shall afford the defendant an opportunity to make a statement in his own behalf' seem to connote a different and more extensive procedure than exists when 'a defendant' moves, requests or acts, under the other rules.  Cf. Fed.R.Crim.P. 15(a), 16, 17(b), 21(a), 21(b), 24(b), 28, 29(a) and 31(d).  A lawyer may ordinarily act for a defendant (and, for example, waive the polling of a jury, or a peremptory challenge of a prospective juror) without any showing of a waiver by a defendant.  But here we think either the defendant, or counsel of his choice, in defendant's presence, can waive.  If a defendant has any objection to his counsel's waiver made in his presence, he can then express himself.  And cf. People v. Rogers, Cal.App.1960, 8 Cal.Rptr. 843.


12
That defendant is entitled to representation of counsel at all stages of the proceedings, including sentencing, does not necessarily mean he cannot speak 'in his own behalf * * * in mitigation of punishment.'


13
The record is bare of any statement made 'in his own behalf * * * in mitigation of punishment.'  Plenty was said by his counsel in attempting to establish his lack of guilt.


14
Nor can we clearly find a waiver here, as existed in Yaich v. United States, supra.  It is true Mr. Tietz (counsel for appellant Taylor) stated:


15
'I can say no more * * * I fear that anything I might say now might not help my client.  I have said everything I can.'


16
Had this been said after conviction and at time of sentence after some argument in mitigation had been made by counsel for appellant, we would not hesitate to find a waiver.  But here the record discloses no statement of any kind in mitigation had been made by counsel, or by his client.  Thus Mr. Tietz's reference to 'having said everything I can' may very well have referred to what had been said by counsel in his client's defense before the adjudication of guilt.


17
We therefore hold the findings and adjudication of guilt in the Taylor case are correct, but the sentence is vacated.  The judgment of conviction entered under Rule 32(b), which is interwoven with the sentence heretofore imposed, should be re-entered concurrently with resentencing.  The matter is remanded to the district court in order that a sentence may be correctly imposed under Rule 32 after a hearing in which the appellant Taylor has the opportunity to make a statement on his own behalf and to present information in mitigation of punishment, should he so desire.  His counsel can do this for Taylor, or Taylor can waive his right of allocution, either by his own statement, or the statement of counsel of his choice, made in his, the appellant's, presence.


18
We recognize this remand may well be an idle act, but we are satisfied that without such remand, there is no sufficient proof of compliance with the provisions of Rule 32(a), mandatory in the absence of waiver.


19
HAMLEY, Circuit Judge, with whom Circuit Judges STEPHENS, POPE and MERRILL join (concurring in part and dissenting in part).


20
I concur in that part of the majority opinion which rejects Taylor's argument concerning the board's failure to reopen the matter of classification.  I also concur in that part of the majority opinion in which the findings and adjudication of guilt are upheld, the sentence is vacated, and the matter is remanded to the district court for resentencing.  I dissent from that part of the majority opinion in which the view is expressed that the right of allocution given Taylor under rule 32(a), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.A., may be waived by the statement of Taylor's counsel if made in Taylor's presence.


21
I am aware of the fact that in an opinion filed on August 2, 1960, in Yaich v. United States, 9 Cir., 283 F.2d 613, a panel of this court held that a defendant's right of allocution can be so waived.  A petition for rehearing is pending in that case and accordingly the mandate has not yet issued.  Yaich therefore does not have the precedent status of a decided case of this court and does not require overruling in order to reach a contrary result here.


22
In discussing the allocution question the majority makes this statement, with which I entirely agree:


23
'* * * The words 'shall afford the defendant an opportunity to make a statement in his own behalf' seem to connote a different and more extensive procedure than exists when 'a defendant' moves, requests or acts, under the other rules.  Cf. Fed.R.Crim.P. 15(a), 16, 17(b), 21(a), 21(b), 24(b), 28, 29(a) and 31(d).'


24
But in making this statement, the majority has, in my view, established the invalidity of its own further conclusion on the question of waiver.  Wherein has the majority under its interpretation of rule 32(a) preserved for defendants a 'different and more extensive' procedure than when a defendant moves, requests or acts under the other described rules?  Under these other rules an attorney is permitted to act of waive for his client, and the majority holds that this is also true under rule 32(a).  The proviso of the majority, that in order to have waiver by counsel under rule 32(a) the defendant must be present in court, adds no procedure which is 'different or more extensive' than in the case of the other rules.  Except in the rare noncapital case where a defendant voluntarily absents himself during the trial, he is always present in court.  See rule 43, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.A.


25
The majority correctly notes a division of opinion among the circuits on the question under consideration.  Three cases supporting the view that waiver of allocution can be by counsel are cited by the majority.  In the first of these, Green, certiorari has been granted and the question is now pending before the Supreme Court.  362 U.S. 949, 80 S.Ct. 867, 4 L.Ed.2d 867.  A later opinion was rendered in Green involving other questions, 274 F.2d 59, and certiorari was again granted.  363 U.S. 839, 80 S.Ct. 1621, 4 L.Ed.2d 1724.  In Kennedy the court's ruling was expressed in part of one sentence of the opinion, no reasons or citation of authority being given.  In Galgano & Carminati it was pointed out that Carminati was given the minimum sentence which was possible under the statute and hence anything said in mitigation of punishment would have been futile.


26
The case of People v. Rogers, Cal.App.1960, 8 Cal.Rptr. 843, 845, is cited by the majority as bearing upon the right of counsel to waive for his client.  The court, however, was not dealing with the allocution question and in fact stated: '* * * The record, however, shows that he was properly asked by the court if he had any legal cause to show why judgment should not now be pronounced against him; that he replied he had none * * *'.


27
The one court of appeals which has dealt exhaustively with the historical background of the rule has expressed the view that the right of allocution can be waived only by the defendant personally.  In his concurring opinion in Couch v. United States, 98 U.S.App.D.C. 292, 235 F.2d 519, 521, Judge Fahy, with Chief Judge Edgerton and Circuit Judges Bazelon and Washington joining, in addition to his interesting narrative of the history of the right of allocution makes some emphatic statements as to the meaning and operation of rule 32(a).  Judge Fahy stated:


28
'Rule 32(a) * * * has the force of law.  * * *  We think the Rule means, as it says, that before imposing sentence the court shall afford the defendant an opportunity to make a statement in his own behalf and to present information in mitigation of punishment.  He may respond through counsel if he desires, or he may remain silent.  But the opportunity afforded must be personal, and it is not when, as here, the judge asks only counsel if counsel has anything to say. * * *  We think that where the procedure prescribed by the Rule is not followed the error is not to be ignored as harmless.  * * *


29
'An opportunity afforded to counsel ordinarily is an opportunity afforded to his client.  It is essential to maintain this relationship of counsel to court and to client in order to preserve counsel's vital role in the administration of justice.  But there are exceptions, and the one under consideration has long been established.  A prisoner at the bar is placed apart so as to be able to speak for himself at the moment immediately preceding sentence, when he is faced with deprivation of liberty or with a fine, or both, and is about to be adjudged a criminal.  He may then speak personally to the judge before the judge imposes sentence.  In ancient times this procedure became known as allocution or allocutus, clearly embodied in modern times in Rule 32(a).'


30
It will be noted that Judge Fahy says that the defendant about to be sentenced may respond through counsel if he desires.  With that statement I agree.  But the expression of that desire to waive must come directly from him in open court and be shown in the record of the proceedings and cannot be implied merely from or by virtue of any statement made by counsel.  The declaration of Judge Fahy, the last paragraph of his opinion on page 524, should be followed by this court:


31
'Rule 32(a) now extends the ancient procedure to all criminal cases in the federal courts. * * *  For we think the Rule has now become a command upon the federal courts.  To permit a departure from this command to go uncorrected in a particular case, assuming the question to be properly before us, in our view would be to permit a practice which violates the Rule to supersede a rule of law prescribed by the Supreme Court under authority of Congress after centuries of development in the common law.'


32
The fact that in Couch the court gave only prospective application to its ruling is of no consequence.  The explanation for using this judicial technique may be that the question arose in a section 2255 proceeding rather than on direct appeal as in this case.


33
The right of allocution provided for by rule 32(a) is designed to require direct communication between judge and defendant after the trial with all of its complexities has ended, and the judge is at last required to exercise his own discretion and judgment in fixing the penalty.  Up to that point direct communication is not especially important-- but now it is.  If a defendant wishes to forego that right, he may freely do so.  He may do so by standing mute as well as by speaking.  But he cannot do so unless the judge makes direct inquiry of him thereby affording him the right to speak or to indicate by word or silence that he waives the right or desires his attorney to speak for him.


34
The doctrine of waiver by counsel with which the right of allocution is now to be diluted will plague us in the future.  Trial judges are now being told that they need not inquire of defendants whether they wish to be heard if their attorneys make statements dealing with mitigation of punishment.  Thus, when the question is raised on future appeals we must on an ad hoc basis analyze such statements of counsel, or notations in the clerk's minutes, or recitals in the judgment, to determine whether there has been an effective waiver of the defendant's personal right in this curious manner.


35
Unless there is a transcribed report of the attorney's statement this inquiry must be limited to a review of the clerk's minutes and the form of judgment.  How inadequate or incorrect for such a purpose minute notations may be in a particular case is sufficiently evidenced by the only relevant notation made in this case:


36
'Neither side having anything further to offer and neither side deserving to make further argument * * *.'


37
The judgment and sentence in this case was filled in on a printed form.  Among the printed recitals is this: '* * * and the court having asked the defendant whether he has anything to say why judgment should not be pronounced.'  It is conceded that Taylor was not asked this question, yet the printed recital was not stricken.  There is no recital to the effect that Taylor's counsel was called upon by the trial judge or what response the attorney gave.  This demonstrates that not even the form of judgment provides a reliable source of information in determining, under the majority test, whether a defendant's attorney said enough to constitute a 'waiver' of the right of allocution.


38
I would reverse and remand for resentencing with directions to the trial judge to make direct inquiry of Taylor whether he wishes to make a statement in his own behalf and to present any information in mitigation of punishment.

                 Case: 13-15872       Date Filed: 10/06/2014      Page: 2 of 6


      Marian Morgan appeals for substantive unreasonableness her 405-month

imprisonment sentence, imposed at the high end of the applicable Sentencing

Guidelines range. We affirm.

                                    I. BACKGROUND

      In May 2011, a federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment

charging Morgan with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, in

violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; seven counts of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C.

§ 1343; five counts of transfer of funds taken by fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C.

§§ 2314, 2; six counts of money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1957, 2;

and three counts of making false statements on income tax returns, in violation of

26 U.S.C. § 7206(1), 18 U.S.C. § 2. Morgan’s husband, John Morgan, along with

Stephen Bowman and Eli Hecksher, 1 also were charged in the scheme.

      Bowman pled guilty to Count 1 (conspiracy to defraud the United States)

and Count 12 (transfer of funds taken by fraud), pursuant to a plea agreement, in

exchange for the dismissal of the remaining counts. The district judge sentenced

Bowman to 51 months of imprisonment. Similarly, John Morgan pled guilty to

Count 1 and Count 16 (money laundering). John Morgan was sentenced to 121

months of imprisonment. Morgan pled not guilty, proceeded to trial, and was

found guilty of all 22 counts.


      1
          Hecksher resides in Denmark and has not yet been extradited.
                                                2
               Case: 13-15872    Date Filed: 10/06/2014    Page: 3 of 6


      At sentencing, the district judge determined Morgan’s offense level was 43,

which included a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3 for Morgan’s

abuse of a position of trust. Her total offense level of 43 and criminal history

category of I resulted in a Sentencing Guidelines range of life imprisonment.

Because the Guidelines range exceeded the maximum statutory penalty of 264

years of imprisonment, her advisory range became 264 years of imprisonment.

The judge sentenced Morgan to 420 months (35 years) of imprisonment, well

below the advisory range of 264 years. Morgan appealed her conviction and

sentence. We affirmed her conviction but vacated her sentence, because the two-

level enhancement for abuse of a position of trust was improper. United States v.

Morgan, 530 F. App’x 908 (11th Cir. 2013) (per curiam), cert. denied, 134 S.Ct.

1045 (2014).

      During the resentencing proceeding, the district judge subtracted two levels

from Morgan’s offense level for the erroneous abuse-of-trust enhancement and

determined Morgan’s correct Guidelines range was 324 to 405 months of

imprisonment. After hearing arguments from the parties, the judge sentenced

Morgan to 405 months of imprisonment, at the top of the correct Guidelines range.

The judge stated nothing had changed in the case other than the enhancement for

abuse of a position of trust. The offense conduct involved millions of dollars and

numerous victims. The judge stated Morgan had not accepted any responsibility.


                                          3
              Case: 13-15872     Date Filed: 10/06/2014   Page: 4 of 6


The judge also noted a 405-month sentence was appropriate, regardless of

Morgan’s life expectancy. The judge said she had considered the 18 U.S.C. §

3553(a) factors, including the need to protect the public, and the sentence was

sufficient but not greater than necessary. Morgan objected to the sentence as

substantively unreasonable and appealed.

                                 II. DISCUSSION

      On appeal, Morgan argues her 405-month imprisonment sentence is

substantively unreasonable. She also argues her sentence creates an unwarranted

sentencing disparity between her and her codefendants. A district judge must

impose a sentence that is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. Gall v.

United States, 552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S. Ct. 586, 597 (2007). We review the

reasonableness of a sentence “under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.”

Id. at 41, 128 S. Ct. at 591. The party, who challenges the sentence, bears the

burden of establishing that it is unreasonable. United States v.Dougherty, 754 F.3d

1353, 1361 (11th Cir. 2014).

      We examine whether a sentence is substantively reasonable in view of the

totality of the circumstances and the § 3553(a) factors. Gall, 552 U.S. at 51, 128

S. Ct. at 597. The § 3553(a) factors to be considered by a sentencing court include

(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics

of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of


                                          4
              Case: 13-15872     Date Filed: 10/06/2014   Page: 5 of 6


the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the

offense; (3) the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and

(4) the applicable Sentencing Guidelines range. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).

      A sentencing judge also must consider “the need to avoid unwarranted

sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found

guilty of similar conduct.” 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6). But “defendants who

cooperate with the government and enter a written plea agreement are not similarly

situated to a defendant who provides no assistance to the government and proceeds

to trial.” United States v. Docampo, 573 F.3d 1091, 1101 (11th Cir. 2009).

      A sentence is substantively unreasonable if it “does not achieve the purposes

of sentencing stated in § 3553(a).” United States v. Pugh, 515 F.3d 1179, 1191

(11th Cir. 2008) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In addition, a

sentence may be substantively unreasonable if a district judge unjustifiably relied

on any one § 3553(a) factor, failed to consider pertinent § 3553(a) factors, selected

the sentence arbitrarily, or based the sentence on impermissible factors. Id. at

1191–92.

      Morgan’s 405-month sentence is substantively reasonable under the totality

of the circumstances and the § 3553(a) factors. Her numerous offenses involved

more than 80 victims and a loss of over $17.5 million. Morgan never accepted

responsibility for her actions and does not dispute that she lied on the stand during


                                          5
              Case: 13-15872    Date Filed: 10/06/2014     Page: 6 of 6


trial. Although she argues the district judge erroneously continued to view her as

one who had abused a position of trust with the victims, the record shows

otherwise. At the resentencing hearing, the judge acknowledged the abuse-of-trust

enhancement no longer applied and focused on the amount of loss, the number of

victims, and Morgan’s complete lack of remorse. The judge also addressed the

need to protect the public from future crimes by Morgan.

      Morgan went to trial, lied on the stand, and was convicted of all 22 offenses.

John Morgan and Bowman, on the other hand, each pled guilty to only two

offenses and cooperated with the government. Therefore, Morgan is not similarly

situated to John Morgan and Bowman, and her substantially higher sentence is

warranted. Docampo, 573 F.3d at 1101.

      AFFIRMED.

                                                OPINION

¶1          After a jury trial, defendant, William Grant, was convicted of home invasion (720 ILCS

     5/19-6(a)(1) (West 2016)) and was sentenced to 24 years in prison. Defendant appeals his

     conviction and sentence, arguing that the trial court erred in (1) granting the State’s midtrial

     request to remove the lone African American juror from the jury for cause and (2) considering a

     fact inherent in the crime of which defendant was convicted as a factor in aggravation in

     defendant’s sentencing. We affirm the trial court’s judgment.

¶2                                         I. BACKGROUND
¶3           In April 2016, defendant, who is African American, was charged with home invasion

     (two counts), attempted aggravated criminal sexual assault, and certain other related offenses for

     allegedly breaking into a home in Peoria, Illinois, and attempting to sexually assault a person

     who was staying at the residence. Four months later, in August 2016, defendant’s case proceeded

     to a jury trial. The jury was selected with one African American juror, Juror B., on the jury.

¶4           Following opening statements, outside the presence of the jury, the trial court noted that

     two of the jurors were starting to fall asleep. The trial court stated:

                             “Okay. I’m gonna make a record of this then too. It’s 10:00 in the

                     morning. At 9:40, less than one half an hour of—of time being on the—being in

                     the jury box I noticed a juror starting to nod off, starting to fall asleep, and I told

                     the lawyers about it, indicated which juror it is, and it is Juror [B.].

                             And I see his eyelids going more and more towards closing, and as—as

                     that’s happening, his head starts lowering. That whole thing is only maybe five

                     seconds, and I cannot say that he ever fell asleep.

                             And, in fact, I don’t think he did ever fall asleep, but I’m thinking at 9:30

                     in the morning he’s like that, it worries me then about his ability to stay awake the

                     entire morning.

                             And by the way, the juror sitting right in front [Juror C.] was doing the

                     same thing, but nowhere near as much as [Juror B.] so I’m gonna be keeping my

                     eye on—on both of them.”

¶5           After the testimony of the State’s first witness, the alleged victim of the attempted sexual

     assault, the trial court took a recess. Outside the presence of the jury, the prosecutor informed the

     trial court that he had asked a victim witness advocate who was employed by the Peoria County


                                                       -2-
     State’s Attorney’s Office to watch Juror B. during the victim’s testimony. According to the

     prosecutor, the advocate indicated that Juror B. was sleeping for a large and significant portion

     of the victim’s testimony. The trial court stated that it had been “keeping an eye” on Juror B.

     during the testimony but it had not noticed him sleeping. The advocate told the trial court that

     Juror B. was nodding off and that he had lowered his head down and jolted awake during the

     testimony. The advocate stated further that Juror B.’s tablet had slid off his lap onto the floor two

     or three times and had attracted the attention of other jurors. Defendant’s attorney indicated that

     he did not see Juror B.’s conduct because he was paying attention to the witness and commented

     that, before the trial court considered removing Juror B., it was important for the court to actually

     establish that Juror B. was sleeping. The trial court stated repeatedly that it had complete faith in

     the advocate’s credibility and noted that there easily could have been times where Juror B. had

     done what the advocate claimed but the trial court had not seen it because the trial court was

     watching the witness testify a lot of the time and was also watching the lawyers and all of the

     jurors. The trial court checked to see if the courtroom security cameras had recorded the

     complained-of conduct but was told that the security cameras did not record the jurors. After

     some further discussion, the trial court found that Juror B. had been sleeping.

¶6          On the State’s motion and over defendant’s objection, the trial court dismissed Juror B.

     from the jury for cause. Defendant moved for a mistrial, and the trial court denied that request. In

     denying defendant’s request for a mistrial, the trial court stated that, based upon its own

     observations coupled with the observations of the advocate, it had concluded that Juror B. was

     sleeping and that it had removed Juror B. from the jury for that reason.

¶7          Defendant reminded the trial court that Juror C. had been falling asleep as well. The trial

     court commented that Juror C. “was only doing the eyelids getting heavy thing, nowhere near the


                                                     -3-
     extent that [Juror B.] was doing” but stated that it was worried about Juror C. and that it was

     going to instruct the jurors that they should all stay awake. When the jury was brought back into

     the courtroom, the trial court instructed the jurors that it expected the jurors to stay away during

     the trial. The trial then proceeded, and defendant was eventually found guilty of home invasion. 1

¶8          A presentence investigation report (PSI) was ordered, and the case was scheduled for a

     sentencing hearing. Prior to the sentencing hearing, defendant filed two posttrial motions. One

     motion was filed by defense counsel; the other was filed by defendant pro se. In the motions,

     defendant (defendant and defense counsel) argued, among other things, that defendant was

     denied a fair trial when the trial court granted the State’s motion to remove the lone African

     American juror from the jury and that the trial court applied a double standard in doing so. After

     a hearing, the trial court denied defendant’s posttrial motions. In doing so, the trial court

     commented on Juror B. falling asleep during the trial and stated that there was a big difference in

     what the court had observed between Juror B. and any other juror.

¶9          Defendant’s PSI showed that defendant was 48 years old and had a lengthy criminal

     history that spanned over 30 years. Defendant had seven prior felony convictions—four for the

     Class 4 felony offense of failing to register or to report address change as a sex offender (1998,

     2000, 2000, 2002), one for the Class 3 felony offense of failing to report address change as a sex

     offender (2009), one for the Class 2 felony offense of aggravated domestic battery (2006), and

     one for the Class X felony offense of aggravated criminal sexual assault (1987). Defendant also

     had approximately 18 prior misdemeanor convictions (not including traffic offenses), many of

     which were for resisting a police officer or correctional employee.



            1
             Defendant was actually found guilty of two counts of home invasion. A mistrial was declared on
     a remaining charge because the jury was unable to reach a verdict on that charge.


                                                      -4-
¶ 10          A sentencing hearing was held in December 2016. During the sentencing hearing, the

       State recommended to the trial court that defendant be sentenced to the maximum sentence of 30

       years in prison because of defendant’s criminal record; the circumstances of the offense

       (breaking into a person’s home, holding a knife to a woman’s throat in her own bedroom, and

       demanding that the woman take her clothes off); the need to deter others from committing the

       same offense; and the need to protect the community from defendant. In addition, the State

       suggested to the trial court that defendant’s conduct had threatened serious harm in that the

       victim awoke to find defendant on top of her and that defendant had held a knife to the victim’s

       throat in her own bedroom. Defense counsel argued that, while defendant had a number of

       previous convictions, his record did not warrant the harsh sentence advocated by the State and

       asked the court to consider a sentence in the lower portion of the sentencing range. Defense

       counsel pointed out to the court that five of defendant’s seven prior felony convictions were for

       registration offenses, that defendant’s prior Class X felony conviction was for an offense that

       took place a long time ago, and that defendant had already been punished for his prior offenses.

       Defense counsel also noted that defendant had obtained his General Education Development

       certificate, had a significant work history, and had struggled through some difficulties in his life.

¶ 11          After listening to the arguments of the attorneys, the trial court announced its sentencing

       decision. The trial court stated that it found three factors in aggravation: (1) that “defendant’s

       conduct caused or threatened serious harm with the holding [of] the knife to the throat *** of the

       victim in this case,” (2) that defendant had a history of prior criminal activity, and (3) that the

       sentence was necessary to deter others from committing the same crime. The trial court

       commented further about defendant’s criminal history, stating:




                                                       -5-
                              “Seven prior felonies is a lot to overlook, to be asked to overlook even if

                      only figuratively asked that. Seven prior felonies. One is a [sic] aggravated

                      criminal sexual assault, a Class X. Another is aggravated domestic battery, Class

                      2. The others are failures to report. I count failures to report. The legislature

                      counts them and insists that I count them. This [‘]only failures to report,[’] what

                      do you mean only I would say? Definitely do not rise to the level of an aggravated

                      domestic battery or a [sic] aggravated criminal sexual assault.”

       The trial court ultimately sentenced defendant to 24 years in prison. 2

¶ 12          Defendant filed a motion to reconsider sentence and argued that the sentence imposed

       upon him was excessive. A hearing was later held on the motion. When defense counsel finished

       his argument on the motion and before the State responded, the trial court commented:

                              “Sentencing range was six to 30 years. Day-for-day good time applies. I

                      did not have the option of probation. Defendant had seven prior felony

                      convictions, just for everybody’s information.”

       After the State made its argument on the motion, the trial court announced its ruling—that it was

       denying defendant’s motion to reconsider sentence. In doing so, the trial court stated:

                              “I said what I said between the two lawyers speaking for a reason, laying

                      out a foundation for my ruling which is to deny the Motion to Reconsider the

                      Sentence. Six-to-30-year range and you get 24 when you’ve got seven prior

¶ 15                                 A. Midtrial Removal of Juror for Cause

¶ 16           As his first point of contention on appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in

       granting the State’s midtrial request to remove the lone African American juror from the jury for

       cause. Defendant asserts first that the disparate treatment of the lone African American juror

       amounted to unconstitutional discrimination that denied defendant equal protection of the law

       because the African American juror (Juror B.) was treated differently than the other similarly

       situated juror (Juror C.) who was not African American. Second, defendant asserts that he was

       denied due process of law when the trial court granted the State undue, outsized influence over

       the composition of the jury during defendant’s trial by granting the State’s request to remove

       Juror B. from the jury for cause without any factual support and without conducting an inquiry.

       According to defendant, there was no independent evidence to support a finding that Juror B. had

       fallen asleep or that he had missed any testimony. Defendant also claims that the trial court did

       not recognize that it had the discretion to reopen voir dire and conduct an independent

       investigation of the State’s allegation of juror misconduct. Instead, defendant maintains, the trial

       court essentially delegated its authority to the State and merely adopted the State’s victim

       witness advocate’s representations that Juror B. had fallen asleep during the testimony, even

       though those representations were contrary to the trial court’s own observations. For all of the

       reasons stated, defendant asks that we reverse his conviction and that we remand this case for

       further proceedings, presumably a new trial.

¶ 17           The State argues first that defendant has forfeited this claim of error on appeal by failing

       to specifically raise it in the trial court. In the alternative, the State argues that the trial court’s


                                                        -7-
       ruling was proper and should be upheld. As for defendant’s equal protection claim, the State

       asserts that the trial court’s ruling did not deprive defendant of equal protection of the law

       because Juror B. and Juror C. were not similarly situated, as the trial court noted that Juror B.’s

       conduct was far worse than Juror C.’s. Thus, the State contends that Juror B. was properly

       dismissed for race-neutral reasons—because he was falling asleep during the presentation of the

       evidence. As for defendant’s due process claim, the State asserts that defendant’s claim should

       be rejected because it is based upon unsubstantiated statements and selective quotes from the

       record. According to the State, a fair reading of the record shows that the trial court exercised its

       discretion and made a finding, which is entitled to deference on appeal, that Juror B. was

       sleeping during the trial. Thus, the State contends, defendant was not deprived of due process of

       the law. For all of the reasons set forth, the State asks that we affirm the trial court’s judgment.

¶ 18          In reply, defendant asserts that he sufficiently raised this claim of error in the trial court

       to prevent the issue from being forfeited on appeal. Alternatively, defendant asserts that this

       court should reach the issue, nevertheless, as a matter of second-prong plain error.

¶ 19          We need not address plain error because we agree with defendant that he properly

       preserved this claim of error for appellate review. See People v. Lovejoy, 235 Ill. 2d 97, 148

       (2009) (stating that the issue raised by a litigant on appeal does not have to be identical to the

       objection raised at trial and that a court will not find that a claim has been forfeited when it is

       clear that the trial court had the opportunity to review essentially that same claim). Even though

       defendant may not have specifically referred to equal protection or due process, he raised

       essentially the same claims in the trial court when he argued that the trial court erred in granting

       the State’s request to remove Juror B. for cause, that the trial court applied an unfair double

       standard, and that he was deprived of a fair trial as a result of the trial court’s ruling. We find,


                                                        -8-
       therefore, that the forfeiture rule does not apply, and we will now address the merits of

       defendant’s first claim of error.

¶ 20          The question of whether a defendant was denied equal protection or due process by the

       trial court is a question of law that is subject to de novo review on appeal. See People v. Hollins,

       366 Ill. App. 3d 533, 538 (2006) (stating that because an equal protection claim is a

       constitutional question, the standard of review on appeal is de novo); People v. Williams, 2013 IL

       App (1st) 111116, ¶ 75 (stating that whether a defendant’s due process rights have been denied is

       an issue of law that is subject to de novo review on appeal). The equal protection clause of the

       fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the exclusion of any individual

       juror from a jury on account of his or her race. See U.S. Const., amend. XIV; Powers v. Ohio,

       499 U.S. 400, 404 (1991); Hollins, 366 Ill. App. at 538. Although a defendant has no right to a

       jury composed in whole or in part of persons of his own race, he does have the right to be tried

       by a jury whose members are selected using nondiscriminatory criteria. Powers, 499 U.S. at 404.

       Because the fourteenth amendment protects an accused throughout the proceedings used to bring

       him to justice, the State may not draw up its jury lists pursuant to neutral procedures but then

       resort to discrimination in other parts of the selection process. Id. at 409. An equal protection

       claim arises when a charge is made that similarly situated individuals were treated differently

       without a rational relationship to a legitimate State purpose. Kaltsas v. City of North Chicago,

       160 Ill. App. 3d 302, 305-06 (1987). To establish a claim of racial discrimination in jury

       selection, a purpose to discriminate must be present, “which may be proven by systematic

       exclusion of eligible jury persons of the proscribed race or by unequal application of the law to

       such an extent as to show intentional discrimination.” Akins v. Texas, 325 U.S. 398, 403-04

       (1945). The burden is on the defendant to establish discrimination. Id. at 400.


                                                      -9-
¶ 21          The due process clauses of the United States and Illinois Constitutions protect individuals

       from the deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. U.S. Const., amend.

       XIV; Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, § 2; People v. One 1998 GMC, 2011 IL 110236, ¶ 21; People v.

       Pollard, 2016 IL App (5th) 130514, ¶ 29. Under the case law, there are two distinct branches of

       due process analysis: substantive due process and procedural due process. Pollard, 2016 IL App

       (5th) 130514, ¶ 29. When a violation of substantive due process is alleged, such as in the present

       case, the appropriate inquiry is whether the individual has been subjected to the arbitrary

       exercise of the powers of government, unrestrained by the established principles of private rights

       and distributive justice. Id. Substantive due process requires, among other things, that there be an

       overall balance—a level playing field—between the prosecution and the defense in a criminal

       trial. See United States v. Harbin, 250 F.3d 532, 540 (7th Cir. 2001); Tyson v. Trigg, 50 F.3d

       436, 441 (7th Cir. 1995); In re Detention of Kortte, 317 Ill. App. 3d 111, 115-16 (2000).

       Substantive due process, however, does not mandate that the rights or advantages granted to the

       prosecution and the defense be in absolute symmetry at every stage of a criminal proceeding,

       only that the overall total balance between each side be designed to achieve the goal of a fair

       trial. See Harbin, 250 F.3d at 540; Tyson, 50 F.3d at 441. Nevertheless, a shift at just one stage

       of a criminal trial as to the rights or advantages granted to each side might so skew the balance of

       rights or advantages in favor of the prosecution that it deprives the defendant of the right to a fair

       trial. See Harbin, 250 F.3d at 540; Tyson, 50 F.3d at 441.

¶ 22          After having reviewed the record in the present case, we find that the trial court did not

       deprive defendant of equal protection or due process by granting the State’s midtrial request to

       remove Juror B. from the jury for cause. The record clearly shows that a race-neutral reason

       existed for the removal of Juror B.—Juror B. had fallen asleep during the presentation of the


                                                       - 10 -
       evidence. Although defendant points to Juror C. as a similarly situated juror who was not

       removed, the record abundantly shows that Juror B. and Juror C. were not similarly situated. In

       fact, the trial court specifically noted that Juror C.’s level of “nodding off” was nowhere near as

       bad as Juror B.’s. Furthermore, we are not persuaded by defendant’s suggestion that the trial

       court failed to conduct a proper inquiry as to whether Juror B. had fallen asleep during the first

       witness’s testimony. The trial court obtained input from the State, the defendant’s attorney, and

       the victim advocate; checked to determine whether the jurors’ actions had been recorded by the

       security cameras; and considered its own observations before ultimately making a specific

       finding that Juror B. had fallen asleep during the testimony of the witness. Contrary to

       defendant’s assertion on appeal, there is no indication that the trial court was unaware of its

       ability to inquire further into the factual circumstances surrounding Juror B.’s conduct during the

       trial if the trial court chose to do so. Moreover, the facts in the present case do not in any way

       indicate that the trial court gave the State an improper, unfair, or outsized amount of control over

       the composition of the jury at any time during the course of the trial. Rather, the facts show that

       the trial court was required to make a difficult decision and to remove a juror for cause after that

       juror had fallen asleep during an important part of the trial. We, therefore, find defendant’s

       argument on this issue to be without merit.

¶ 23          In reaching that conclusion, we note that we are not persuaded that a different result is

       mandated by the decisions in Harbin (cited above) or People v. Brown, 2013 IL App (2d)

       111228—the two main cases cited by defendant in support of his argument on this issue. Both

       Harbin and Brown involved the prosecutions’ midtrial use of a peremptory challenge (see

       Harbin, 250 F.3d at 537; Brown, 2013 IL App (2d) 111228, ¶ 1), which is not the situation

       before the court in the present case. Indeed, in both of those cases, the courts recognized,


                                                      - 11 -
       although somewhat implicitly, that the result might have been different if the juror at issue had

       been removed for cause, rather than pursuant to a peremptory challenge. See Harbin, 250 F.3d at

       539; Brown, 2013 IL App (2d) 111228, ¶ 31.

¶ 24                    B. Possible Consideration of an Improper Factor in Sentencing

¶ 25          As his second point of contention on appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in

       considering a fact inherent in the crime of which defendant was convicted as a factor in

       aggravation in defendant’s sentencing. More specifically, defendant asserts that the trial court

       improperly found that the threat of force underlying the incident was a factor in aggravation at

       sentencing (that the conduct caused or threatened serious harm), even though that fact was an

       element of the offense of home invasion. Defendant acknowledges that he did not properly

       preserve that claim of error for appellate review but asks that this court review the error,

       nevertheless, under the second prong of the plain error doctrine. For all of the reasons stated,

       defendant asks that we vacate his sentence and remand this case for a new sentencing hearing.

¶ 26          The State argues that the trial court did not commit plain error in sentencing defendant in

       this case and that defendant’s sentence was appropriate based upon the offense and defendant’s

       criminal history. In support of that argument, the State asserts first that even though the trial

       court mentioned the allegedly improper factor in sentencing defendant, a remand for

       resentencing is not required because the record clearly shows that the trial court did not give

       significant weight to the improper factor. Second and in the alternative, the State asserts that

       although consideration of that factor would be improper in some circumstances, it was not

       improper under the circumstances of the present case where the trial court considered the factor

       when it was considering the nature and circumstances of the offense and the degree of harm. For




                                                    - 12 -
       all the reasons set forth, the State asks that we honor defendant’s forfeiture of this issue and that

       we affirm defendant’s sentence.

¶ 27           The plain error doctrine is a very limited and narrow exception to the forfeiture or

       procedural default rule that allows a reviewing court to consider unpreserved error if either one

       of the following two circumstances is present: (1) a clear or obvious error occurred and the

       evidence in the case was so closely balanced that the error alone threatened to tip the scales of

       justice against the defendant, regardless of the seriousness of the error, or (2) a clear or obvious

       error occurred and the error was so serious that it affected the fairness of the defendant’s trial and

       challenged the integrity of the judicial process, regardless of the closeness of the evidence.

       People v. Walker, 232 Ill. 2d 113, 124 (2009); People v. Piatkowski, 225 Ill. 2d 551, 565 (2007);

       People v. Herron, 215 Ill. 2d 167, 177-87 (2005); Ill. S. Ct. R. 615(a) (eff. Jan. 1, 1967). Under

       either prong of the plain error doctrine, the burden of persuasion is on the defendant. Walker, 232

       Ill. 2d at 124. If the defendant fails to satisfy that burden, the forfeiture or procedural default of

       the issue must be honored. Id. The first step in any plain error analysis is to determine whether an

       error occurred. Id. at 124-25. To do so, a reviewing court must conduct a substantive review of

       the issue. Id. at 125.

¶ 28           Whether the trial court relied on an improper factor in sentencing a defendant is a

       question of law that is subject to de novo review on appeal. People v. Abdelhadi, 2012 IL App

       (2d) 111053, ¶ 8. In general, although a trial court has broad discretion when imposing a

       sentence, it may not consider a factor that is inherent in the offense of which defendant has been

       convicted as an aggravating factor in sentencing defendant for that offense. Id. ¶ 9; People v.

       Phelps, 211 Ill. 2d 1, 11-12 (2004). Doing so would constitute an improper double enhancement.

       See Phelps, 211 Ill. 2d at 12. The rule prohibiting such double enhancements is based on the


                                                       - 13 -
       rationale that the legislature obviously already considered the factors inherent in the offense

       when setting the range of penalties for that offense and that it would be improper, therefore, to

       consider those factors once again as a justification for imposing a greater penalty. Id. The

       defendant bears the burden to establish that a sentence was based on an improper consideration.

       Abdelhadi, 2012 IL App (2d) 111053, ¶ 9. On appeal, a reviewing court will not vacate a

       sentence that was based upon an improper factor and remand for resentencing if the reviewing

       court can determine from the record that the weight placed on the improperly considered

       aggravating factor was so insignificant that it did not lead to a greater sentence. See People v.

       Heider, 231 Ill. 2d 1, 21 (2008).

¶ 29           In the present case, we need not determine whether the trial court improperly considered

       a factor inherent in home invasion when it sentenced defendant for that offense because we find

       that, even if the trial court did so, defendant’s sentence should still be affirmed because the

       record clearly shows that the trial court gave insignificant weight to that allegedly improper

       factor. 3 Although the trial court mentioned the factor as being one of the three factors it was

       considering in aggravation, it is clear from the trial court’s comments, especially those that the

       trial court made in denying defendant’s motion to reconsider sentence, that the trial court’s focus

       on the aggravating factors in sentencing was upon defendant’s criminal history and his prior




               3
                 Although the State agreed that the trial court considered a factor inherent in the offense, we
       make no such determination in this case because we have found it unnecessary to do so. We have made
       no ruling upon whether the threat of force, which may be an element of home invasion depending on how
       the offense is charged, is the same as the factor in aggravation—that defendant’s conduct caused or
       threatened serious harm. While not a determinative factor in our decision in this case, we note that our
       supreme court has indicated that it is permissible for a trial court to consider the force employed and the
       physical manner in which a victim’s death was brought about (but not the end result—the fact of the
       victim’s death) in applying the statutory aggravating factor that defendant’s conduct caused serious harm
       to the victim when sentencing a defendant for voluntary manslaughter, an offense in which serious bodily
       harm was implicit in the offense. See People v. Saldivar, 113 Ill. 2d 256, 271 (1986).
                                                         - 14 -
       felony convictions. We, therefore, reject defendant’s argument on this issue and uphold the

       sentence imposed.

PER CURIAM:


1
This is an appeal from an order of the District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, denying injunctive relief, salary payments, and attorney's fees sought by appellant following the school district's refusal to reemploy him as a principal for the 1969-70 school year.  Appellant Glover instituted this action on May 2, 1969, against school superintendent Harold T. Daniel and his employer, the Pike County, Georgia, Board of Education.  The action was brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1343(3); 42 U.S.C. 1981, 1983, 2000d et seq.; 45 CFR 80.4 and 181 et seq.; the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The complaint asserted that the board's refusal to rehire appellant principal was racially motivated in violation of his federal statutory and constitutional rights.


2
The case was tried to the court without a jury on a single issue: Whether the failure to rehire the plaintiff as principal of the Pike County schools for the 1969-70 school year was or was not for racial reasons in violation of his civil rights.


3
A full plenary hearing was conducted.  Eleven witnesses, including plaintiff and defendant Daniel, were interrogated on both direct and cross examination.


4
Plaintiff Glover testified in his own behalf that he is 42 years of age, a member of the black race, holding a position with a county school system during the past year as principal of Pike Consolidated School.  He testified that he holds an A. B. Degree, M. A. Degree, and a six-year certificate from the State Department of Education, having received his A. B. Degree from Ft. Valley State College and his Masters Degree from the Atlanta University.  He testified further that he had been a principal for 13 years, having served five years at East Pike Elementary School in Zebulon and eight years at Pike Consolidated School, Concord, Georgia.  Before that he was a teacher in the Pike County System at Zebulon and at Concord.  As a teacher, his principal subject was Social Science.  He testified that he improved the average daily attendance and lunchroom attendance, and used a self-study system, using evaluative criteria to upgrade the curriculum of the school.  This self-study criteria was testified to be a group of standards got together by experts from all over the country.  The purpose was to apply this system against his school and see where it fell short.  This happened prior to his going over to Pike County Consolidated School.  He testified that he did similar things at the Pike County Consolidated School.


5
The only testimony he gave, bearing directly on the question as to why he thought his discharge was racially motivated, was to the effect that he had given 19 years of good service, that he was professionally trained, and that he could think of no other reason for his discharge other than race.  He did testify that the superintendent told him that he 'talked too much' at the principals' meetings and that on one occasion, after his discharge, when the County Board met to reconsider its action, one board member said he wouldn't vote to rehire Glover because none of the white folks wanted him.  However, the statement imputed to a board member was made at a meeting called to reconsider their action in not extending him a contract, and was after the original action had been taken not to rehire Glover.


6
The other witnesses called by Glover testified basically and generally to his good character, with little or no evidence upon the issue of racial discrimination.


7
Considering the record as a whole, we hold that plaintiff Glover failed to discharge his burden of proof to substantiate his claims by a preponderance of the evidence.  His claims are based upon speculation and suspicion.


8
The district court denied relief, stating that the plaintiff had not shown that his failure to be rehired was racially motivated.  The findings of the district court are supported by evidence and are not clearly erroneous.  Glover v. Daniel et al., 318 F.Supp. 1070 (N.D.Ga.1969).

MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
JACK ZOUHARY, District Judge.

Background
This Court entered judgment in this case on October 26, 2009, 673 F.Supp.2d 582, 2009 WL 3426571 (N.D.Ohio 2009), upholding an arbitration award in favor of Defendant United Steelworkers of America, Local 890L ("the Union") (Doc. Nos. 24, 25). That award reversed Plaintiff Titan Tire's decision to discharge Grievant *590 Linda Tracy who, following a workplace accident, tested positive for marijuana use. Instead of discharge, the arbitrator ordered Tracy suspended for ninety days and returned to work. On November 20, Titan filed a Notice of Appeal (Doc. No. 26). This matter is now before the Court on the Union's Motion to Enforce Judgment (Doc. No. 27), and on Titan's Motion for Stay pending appeal (Doc. No. 28). Both parties filed respective Oppositions (Doc. Nos. 29, 33), and Titan filed a supplemental brief upon this Court's request (Doc. No. 32).
Titan does not dispute that it has yet to comply with the arbitration award and this Court's Judgment. However, Titan argues it is entitled to a stay pending resolution of its appeal by the Sixth Circuit. In considering whether to grant a stay under Federal Civil Rule 62(c), this Court must consider four factors:
(1) the likelihood that the party seeking the stay will prevail on the merits of the appeal; (2) the likelihood that the moving party will be irreparably harmed absent a stay; (3) the prospect that others will be harmed if the court grants the stay; and (4) the public interest in granting the stay.
Michigan Coal. of Radioactive Material Users, Inc. v. Griepentrog, 945 F.2d 150, 153 (6th Cir.1991); see also Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776, 107 S.Ct. 2113, 95 L.Ed.2d 724 (1987) (noting that the factors are the same under Federal Appellate Rule 8(a)). These factors are not separate elements that a movant must satisfy, but are "interrelated considerations that must be balanced together." Griepentrog, 945 F.2d at 153. Furthermore, "the probability of success that must be demonstrated is inversely proportional to the amount of irreparable injury [movant] will suffer absent the stay." Id. Applying these factors, this Court finds that a stay is not warranted in the instant case.

Likelihood of Success on Appeal
Overturning an arbitration award "should be the rare exception, not the rule." Mich. Family Res., Inc. v. Serv. Employees Int'l Union Local 517M, 475 F.3d 746, 753 (6th Cir.2007). This Court noted the exceedingly deferential standard of review for arbitration awards in its Memorandum Opinion (Doc. No. 24, p. 3-4). With this deference and with these facts, this Court believes reversal of its decision and the arbitration award is unlikely. Titan merely "refers the Court to prior briefs" and asserts that it has raised "serious legal issues for the Sixth Circuit to examine" (Doc. No. 32, p. 3). This bald conclusion fails to convince this Court that Titan is likely to prevail on appeal.

Harm to Titan
Titan argues it would sustain irreparable harm if Tracy returned to work, because its drug policy might be viewed with skepticism by other employees. This concern was addressed by the terms of the arbitration award, which imposed the significant penalty of a ninety-day suspension on Tracy. Titan also argues that it is currently at minimum staffing levels, and returning Tracy to work would result in a disruption in flow in the workforce. That may be true, but that is simply the necessary cost of complying with the arbitration award. Cf. In re Dist. No. 1-Pacific Coast Dist., Marine Engineers' Beneficial Assoc. (AFL-CIO), 723 F.2d 70, 78 (D.C.Cir.1983) ("It can hardly be claimed that the cost of complying with the terms of an agreedupon arbitration procedure is irreparable harm."). In sum, this Court finds that Titan has failed to show that it will suffer the substantial irreparable harm needed to overcome its low likelihood of success on the merits.


*591 Harm to Union and Tracy
In contrast, Tracy would suffer substantial harm if this Court issued a stay. Tracy has been out of work since March 2008 and, according to the Union, she is not receiving wages, health insurance, or other benefits. Further deprivation of wages and benefits during the lengthy pendency of an appeal would result in direct and immediate harm to Tracy, even if she is eventually awarded back pay.[1]

Public Interest
While the public has a serious interest in maintaining workplace safety, this Court is unconvinced that returning Tracy to work would compromise safety at Titan's facility. The arbitrator, well-acquainted with Titan's drug policy and the specific facts of this case, concluded that a ninety-day suspension was sufficient punishment. That punishment would serve the specific objective of impressing upon Tracy the dangers of working under the influence of drugs, as well as reinforce the importance of the drug policy on Titan's entire workforce.

Balancing the Factors
The two cases cited by Titan in support of issuing a stay are distinguishable. In Exxon Corp. v. Esso Worker's Union, Inc., 963 F.Supp. 58, 60 (D.Mass. 1997), the court issued a stay pending appeal on the review of an arbitration award which had reinstated an employee terminated for testing positive for cocaine. The court found that the appeal raised "serious and difficult questions of law," the potential harms to the parties balanced one another, and the public interest favored a stay. Id. The court put particular emphasis on the public interest prong, because the employee worked as a petroleum tanker truck driver, a job with severe public safety implications. Id.
In Ohio Edison Co. v. Ohio Edison Joint Council, 771 F.Supp. 1476 (N.D.Ohio 1990), the court also confronted the issue of a stay pending appeal of an arbitration award reinstating an employee after a drug suspension. The court first found that there was a serious legal question about the applicability of a particular Sixth Circuit case, id. at 1490-91, a finding that was validated by the Sixth Circuit's, later reversal on the merits, see Ohio Edison Co. v. Ohio Edison Joint Council, 947 F.2d 786 (6th Cir.1991). In addition, the court found that there would be harm to the employer in reinstating the employee, because the employee admittedly had an "ongoing problem" with marijuana addiction. Id. at 1491-92. The court also found that the employee would not suffer "substantial injury" and that resolution of the import of "last chance agreements" on appeal was in the public interest. Id. at 1492-93.
The balance of factors, different in the instant case than in either Exxon Corp. or Ohio Edison, does not warrant a stay. There is a low likelihood of success on appeal, the balance of harms favors the Union and Tracy, and the public's interest in workplace safety is adequately protected by the terms of the arbitration award.

Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, Titan's Motion for Stay Pending Appeal (Doc. No. 28) is denied. The Union's Motion to Enforce *592 Judgment pending appeal (Doc. No. 27) is granted. The Union's request for a finding of contempt is denied.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
NOTES
[1]  During a phone conference on December 2, 2009, counsel for Titan raised the possibility of Tracy posting a bond for wages and insurance premiums she receives from Titan while the appeal is pending (Doc. No. 30). Neither party addressed this issue in subsequent briefs, and this Court is aware of no authority that would require a prevailing party to post a bond pending appeal.

CINDY F. INTSCHERT, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, WATERTOWN (NICOLE L. KYLE OF
COUNSEL), FOR RESPONDENT.


     Appeal from a judgment of the Jefferson County Court (Kim H.
Martusewicz, J.), rendered March 15, 2010. The judgment convicted
defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of attempted promoting prison
contraband in the first degree.

     It is hereby ORDERED that the case is held, the decision is
reserved and the matter is remitted to Jefferson County Court for
further proceedings in accordance with the following memorandum:
Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him, upon his plea of
guilty, of attempted promoting prison contraband in the first degree
(Penal Law §§ 110.00, 205.25 [2]). The record of the plea proceeding
establishes that County Court failed to apprise defendant, a
noncitizen, that deportation was a potential consequence of his guilty
plea. As defendant contends and the People correctly concede, the
case should be remitted to afford defendant “the opportunity to move
to vacate his plea upon a showing that there is a ‘reasonable
probability’ that he would not have pleaded guilty had the court
advised him of the possibility of deportation” (People v Fermin, 123
AD3d 465, 466, quoting People v Peque, 22 NY3d 168, 198). We
therefore hold the case, reserve decision, and remit the matter to
County Court for that purpose. Defendant further contends that
counsel was ineffective in failing to inform him that deportation was
a potential consequence of the plea (see Padilla v Kentucky, 559 US
356). Inasmuch as that contention is based upon matters outside the
record, it must be raised in a motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 (see
People v Drammeh, 100 AD3d 650, 651, lv denied 20 NY3d 1098).

PER CURIAM:

     Darryl A. Babb seeks to appeal the district court’s order

denying relief on his petition filed under 28 U.S.C.A. § 2254 (West

1994 & Supp. 2000).   We have reviewed the record and the district

court’s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny

Babb’s motion to proceed in forma pauperis, deny a certificate of

appealability, and dismiss the appeal on the reasoning of the

district court.   Babb v. Taylor, No. CA-00-1499-AM (E.D. Va. filed

Nov. 20, 2000; entered Nov. 21, 2000).   In addition, we deny Babb’s

motion for leave to file his habeas corpus petition out of time.

See Harris v. Hutchinson, 209 F.3d 325, 328-31 (4th Cir. 2000).   We

dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions

are adequately presented in the materials before the court and

argument would not aid the decisional process.

OPINION

PER CURIAM:

Michael Asuncion filed a complaint alleging that Officer A.P. Yok-
ley, the City of Gaithersburg, Maryland, and others (collectively, the
City) violated his civil rights.1See 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (1988). The
alleged violation stems from the arrest and prosecution of Asuncion
for disorderly conduct after he was stopped for a routine traffic viola-
tion. Asuncion argued before the district court that summary judg-
ment on his § 1983 claim was improper because a material issue of
fact existed as to whether Yokley had probable cause to arrest him
and as to whether the prosecutor had probable cause to prosecute him.
Because Maryland law dictates that a prosecution is presumed conclu-
sively to be made with probable cause if an arrestee subsequently is
convicted, even if that conviction is later reversed, see Zablonsky v.
Perkins, 187 A.2d 314, 316 (Md. 1963), the district court granted
summary judgment in favor of the City. On appeal, Asuncion argues
for the first time that he falls under an exception to this rule. For the
reasons discussed below, we affirm.

I.

On December 11, 1991, Yokley stopped Asuncion and issued him
a citation for driving through a red light. After completing the cita-
tion, Yokley asked Asuncion to sign the document. Beyond this junc-
ture, the parties' stories diverge widely. Yokley contends that
Asuncion became agitated and began acting irrationally, creating a
disturbance that distracted other drivers on the road, while Asuncion
claims that Yokley began to harass him verbally and physically with-
out provocation. The conflicting versions of the arrest need not con-
_________________________________________________________________
1 Asuncion does not appeal the district court's grant of summary judg-
ment to the City on his state law claims of assault, battery, false arrest,
intentional infliction of emotional distress, and malicious prosecution.

                     2
cern us; the germane fact is that the encounter resulted in Yokley's
arrest of Asuncion for disorderly conduct.

After a bench trial before the Montgomery County District Court,
Asuncion was convicted of disorderly conduct. On appeal, a jury
found Asuncion not guilty in a trial de novo in the Montgomery
County Circuit Court. See Md. Code Ann., Cts. & Jud. Proc. § 12-
401(f) (Supp. 1995) (providing that certain criminal appeals from the
state district court are tried de novo before the circuit court). Asun-
cion subsequently brought this action, asserting false arrest and mali-
cious prosecution as the bases for his claim that the City violated his
civil rights.

II.

Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires the dis-
trict court to enter summary judgment against a party who, "after ade-
quate time for discovery . . . fails to make a showing sufficient to
establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and
on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex
Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986). To prevail on a motion
for summary judgment, the City must establish that:"(1) there is no
genuine issue as to any material fact; and (2) it is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law." Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co. v. Packer, 60 F.3d
1116, 1119 (4th Cir. 1995) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,
477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986)). If Asuncion fails to offer proof of an
essential element of his case, all other facts are rendered immaterial,
there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and the City is enti-
tled to judgment as a matter of law. See Celotex , 477 U.S. at 323. We
review a grant of summary judgment de novo. Henson v. Liggett
Group, Inc., 61 F.3d 270, 274 (4th Cir. 1995).

To prove his claim under § 1983, Asuncion must show a malicious
prosecution under Maryland law that resulted in a deprivation of his
constitutional rights. See Goodwin v. Metts, 885 F.2d 157, 160 n.1
(4th Cir. 1989) (stating the same for South Carolina law), cert.
denied, 494 U.S. 1081 (1990). Under Maryland law, the tort of mali-
cious prosecution consists of the following elements:

          (a) a criminal proceeding instituted or continued by the
          defendant against the plaintiff, (b) termination of the pro-

                     3
          ceeding in favor of the accused, (c) absence of probable
          cause for the proceeding, and (d) malice, or a primary pur-
          pose in instituting the proceeding other than that of bringing
          an offender to justice.

Brewer v. Mele, 298 A.2d 156, 159 (Md. 1972). Because Asuncion
is unable to prove the absence of probable cause, an essential element
of the tort, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment
in favor of the City.2

Under Maryland law, a conviction determines conclusively the
existence of probable cause, regardless of whether the judgment is
later reversed in a subsequent proceeding. Zablonsky, 187 A.2d at
316. Thus, Asuncion's conviction in the Montgomery County District
Court precludes his establishing the absence of probable cause for the
disorderly conduct charge, even though the jury later found him not
guilty in a subsequent trial de novo in the circuit court. See Quecedo
v. DeVries, 321 A.2d 785, 791 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1974) (reaching
the same conclusion under similar factual circumstances). Because
Asuncion cannot prove an essential element of malicious prosecution
under Maryland law, he cannot establish his claim under § 1983. See
Bussard v. Neil, 616 F. Supp. 854, 856-57 (M.D. Pa. 1985) (granting
summary judgment to defendant on plaintiff's § 1983 claim based on
malicious prosecution where plaintiff failed to prove absence of prob-
able cause because of an earlier conviction that was later reversed).

On appeal, Asuncion argues for the first time that his case falls
within a narrow exception to the Maryland rule that a conviction
determines conclusively the existence of probable cause: if a convic-
tion is "`obtained by fraud, perjury or other corrupt means,'" the con-
viction loses its conclusive effect. Zablonsky , 187 A.2d at 316
(quoting Restatement of Torts § 667 (1938)). Asuncion contends that
his disorderly conduct conviction was obtained through the perjured
_________________________________________________________________
2 The probable cause inquiry with respect to the false arrest claim is
essentially the same as the probable cause inquiry with respect to the
malicious prosecution claim because all of the evidence of the crime of
disorderly conduct used to prosecute Asuncion was before the arresting
officer. Accordingly, because we find that there was probable cause to
prosecute Asuncion, there was necessarily probable cause for the arrest.

                    4
testimony of Yokley, and therefore he should be allowed to prove the
absence of probable cause. Asuncion's argument is meritless. We first
note that we are not required to address this argument on appeal
because Asuncion failed to argue and raise it in the proceedings
before the district court. See Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 120
(1976) ("It is the general rule, of course, that a federal appellate court
does not consider an issue not passed upon below."). Second, in any
event, Asuncion's mere recitation of factual inconsistency is insuffi-
cient to demonstrate perjury by Yokley during the trial before the
state district court. See United States v. Griley, 814 F.2d 967, 971 (4th
Cir. 1987) (holding that inconsistencies in testimony create, at most,
a credibility question for the jury; they do not establish perjury).
Thus, we reject Asuncion's argument.

III.

Because we find no genuine issue of material fact concerning the
existence of probable cause and because we find Asuncion's belated
perjury argument unavailing, we affirm the district court's grant of
summary judgment in favor of the City.

*152 FOX, Judge:[1]
We accepted this certified question from the Circuit Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia, to consider whether a good faith settlement between a plaintiff and a defendant in a multiparty lawsuit extinguishes the rights of non-settling defendants to seek indemnification from the settling defendant.
The sixty-seven plaintiffs from three consolidated lawsuits are students, parents, teachers, and others who allege injuries resulting from exposure to toxic substances at Andrew Jackson Junior High School, in Cross Lanes, West Virginia. One of the toxic substances was a termiticide known as chlordane.
The plaintiffs initially asserted numerous theories of liability against various defendants, including negligence, willful, wanton, and reckless misconduct, breach of warranty, strict product liability, and deliberate intent to injure an employee. However, the focus of this certified question is the plaintiffs' product liability claim against Velsicol Chemical Corporation. Velsicol is the only United States manufacturer of technical chlordane, which is chlordane in its purest form and is used to make other chlordane-containing compounds.[2] In addition to suing Velsicol, the plaintiffs are pursuing product liability claims against others in the chain of distribution, including distributors and applicators of chlordane. Defendants Kanawha County Board of Education and Robert Klatzkin, a former principal at Andrew Jackson Junior High School (hereinafter referred to collectively as the BOE), contend the defendant manufacturer Velsicol is ultimately responsible for damages caused by its defective product.
On 1 April 1994, the plaintiffs agreed to dismiss all claims against Velsicol in exchange for a substantial monetary settlement. Pursuant to court order, the amount of the settlement remained confidential, but non-settling defendants were informed and given the opportunity to challenge its reasonableness. Velsicol intends for this settlement, reached prior to a judicial determination of liability, to extinguish all potential claims arising from this lawsuit, including claims for implied indemnity. However, because Velsicol's settlement agreement did not include therein a release from liability, the non-settling defendants in the chain of distribution want to be able to seek indemnification from Velsicol if they are subsequently made to pay damages to the plaintiffs for injuries they contend Velsicol was solely responsible for as the manufacturer of the defective product.
On 22 April 1994, the plaintiffs and Velsicol jointly requested that the circuit court find their settlement was in good faith in order to extinguish any potential claims against Velsicol for both contribution and indemnification. The non-settling defendants potentially affected by this settlement objected on the grounds that (1) a factual determination of good faith was premature, and (2) a finding of a good faith settlement does not extinguish claims for implied indemnity.[3] Following a hearing, the circuit court tentatively found the settlement was in good faith but deferred *155 its ruling on the settlement's effect on any cross-claims against Velsicol.
After a second hearing on 6 May 1994, the circuit court concluded the settlement was negotiated in good faith and it barred claims for contribution against Velsicol. However, the circuit court ruled that claims for implied indemnity would not be extinguished by the good faith settlement.
On 24 May 1994, the plaintiffs and Velsicol moved for reconsideration of the 6 May 1994 ruling on the implied indemnification issue. The circuit court denied the motion for reconsideration on 31 May 1994, and an order certifying the indemnification issue to this Court was entered on 8 July 1994.
On 12 October 1994, this Court granted the joint petition for review of the following certified question:
Whether a good faith settlement by a defendant extinguishes rights of non-settling defendants and others for implied indemnity against the settling defendant under West Virginia law?
The Circuit Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia, the Honorable Paul Zakaib, Jr., presiding, answered the question in the negative, finding there is a legal and factual distinction between claims of implied indemnification and claims for contribution.
Relying primarily on language found in Smith v. Monongahela Power Co., 189 W.Va. 237, 429 S.E.2d 643 (1993), the plaintiffs and Velsicol now contend the 6 May 1994 circuit court ruling was erroneous, and argue this Court's prior decisions establish that their good faith settlement extinguishes all contribution and indemnification claims the non-settling defendants might wish to assert against Velsicol.
However, the BOE argues the plaintiffs and Velsicol have confused the issues by treating contribution and indemnification as identical legal concepts, when, in fact, "the concept of indemnification plays a unique role and is clearly distinct from contribution in product liability cases." We agree.
Indemnification and contribution are separate and distinct legal concepts. "The idea of indemnity implies a primary or basic liability in one person, though a second person is also for some reason liable with the first, or even without the first, to a third person. Discharge of the obligation by the second person leaves him with a right to secure compensation from the one who, as between themselves, is primarily liable."[4] There are two types of indemnity. Express indemnity is based upon a written agreement between the parties, while implied indemnity is based upon the relationship between the parties. In syllabus points 1 and 2 of Sydenstricker v. Unipunch Products, Inc., 169 W.Va. 440, 288 S.E.2d 511 (1982), this Court explained:
1. "The general principle of implied indemnity arises from equitable considerations. At the heart of the doctrine is the premise that the person seeking to assert implied indemnitythe indemniteehas been required to pay damages caused by a third partythe indemnitor. In the typical case, the indemnitee is made liable to the injured party because of some positive duty created by statute or the common law, but the actual cause of the injury was the act of the indemnitor." Syllabus Point 2, Hill v. Joseph T. Ryerson & Son, Inc., 165 W.Va. 22, 268 S.E.2d 296 (1980).
2. Implied indemnity is based upon principles of equity and restitution and one must be without fault to obtain implied indemnity.
"Very broadly, contribution is the right of one who owes a joint obligation to call upon his fellow obligors to reimburse him if compelled to pay more than his proportionate share of the obligation. Limiting this definition to the tort context, contribution is a method to promote an equitable distribution of loss among those who are jointly and severally liable for a given wrong."[5] Contribution *156 was distinguished from indemnity in syllabus point 4 of Sydenstricker:
The doctrine of contribution has its roots in equitable principles. The right to contribution arises when persons having a common obligation, either in contract or tort, are sued on that obligation and one party is forced to pay more than his pro tanto share of the obligation. One of the essential differences between indemnity and contribution is that contribution does not permit a full recovery of all damages paid by the party seeking contribution. Recovery can only be obtained for the excess that such party has paid over his own share.
The doctrine of contribution and the effect of a good faith settlement between a plaintiff and one of multiple joint tortfeasors on the rights of non-settling joint tortfeasors to contribution were discussed at length by this Court in Board of Education of McDowell County v. Zando, Martin & Milstead, Inc., 182 W.Va. 597, 390 S.E.2d 796 (1990). In syllabus point 2, we explained:
A defendant in a civil action has a right in advance of judgment to join a joint tortfeasor based on a cause of action for contribution. This is termed an "inchoate right to contribution" in order to distinguish it from the statutory right of contribution after a joint judgment conferred by W.Va.Code, 55-7-13 (1923).
Further, in syllabus point 6 of Zando, this Court explained that contribution rights are terminated by a good faith settlement, stating that "[a] party in a civil action who has made a good faith settlement with the plaintiff prior to a judicial determination of liability is relieved from any liability for contribution." However, whether a good faith settlement terminates a non-settling defendant's right to seek implied indemnification against the settling defendant is an issue that has not been addressed by this Court until now.
The principles of Zando regarding contribution rights among joint tortfeasors were reiterated in Smith, supra, an opinion in which this Court set forth specific criteria to aid in determining whether a settlement is in fact made in good faith. As we noted above, the plaintiffs and Velsicol now rely upon language found in Smith to support their contention that the law in West Virginia is that any indemnification claims a non-settling defendant might wish to assert against the settling defendant are also extinguished by a good faith settlement.
In Smith, John Q. Hutchinson was electrocuted when he was working on a truck manufactured by Dico which came into contact with a power line owned and operated by Monongahela Power Company. Dennis Dwight Smith, as administrator of Hutchinson's estate, sued Monongahela Power for negligence, and Monongahela Power filed a third-party complaint against manufacturer Dico for contribution, alleging that defective truck design was a proximate cause of Hutchinson's death. Smith, 429 S.E.2d at 646.
Dico settled with the Hutchinson estate before trial. After the verdict, Monongahela Power and the estate reached a settlement, under which Monongahela Power reserved its right to pursue contribution claims from others, including Dico. Dico moved to dismiss Monongahela Power's claim on the grounds that its settlement with the estate insulated it from Monongahela Power's claims for contribution. The trial court granted Dico's motion. Id. at 647.
The issue in Smith was whether a settlement entered into between a nonparty (Dico) and a claimant (Smith) prior to the instigation of a lawsuit would discharge the nonparty (Dico) from further obligation to either the claimant (Smith) or the nonparty's joint tortfeasor (Monongahela Power). This Court agreed with the lower court's finding that Monongahela Power's right to seek contribution from nonparty/joint tortfeasor Dico was extinguished by the good faith settlement between Dico and Smith.
In the case now before us, the plaintiffs and Velsicol rely heavily on Smith because of the following language contained in the opinion: "Accordingly, we find Monongahela Power's right to seek contribution or indemnification from Dico was extinguished by the settlement between the Hutchinson estate and Dico, provided that the settlement was in *157 good faith." Id. at 649 (emphasis added). Despite this reference to indemnification, the facts indicate quite clearly that Smith was only about a claim for contribution.[6] This single reference to indemnification was unnecessary in the context of the opinion.[7]
Smith is also distinguishable from the case now before us because the relationship between Monongahela Power and Dico did not give rise to a right of implied indemnity. Monongahela Power and Dico were joint tortfeasors. Dico settled with the claimant before trial, and Monongahela Power settled afterwards. The issue was whether Monongahela Power had a right to pursue a contribution claim against Dico, not an indemnification claim. A non-settling defendant's right to seek indemnification from the settling defendant following a good faith settlement in a product liability case is the only issue now before this Court. Reliance upon Smith as precedent is pointless, because although that case addressed a similar question, the issue was raised in the context of contribution claims.
To argue that both contribution and implied indemnity claims should be extinguished by a good faith settlement is to ignore the substantive differences between the two legal concepts. "While contribution permits one tortfeasor to shift a part of the loss to another, the purpose of indemnity is to shift the whole loss."[8] As we noted above, a fundamental distinction between indemnity and contribution is the absence of fault on the part of the party who seeks indemnification. Contribution claims involve joint tortfeasors who share some degree of fault; their liability is premised upon independent negligent acts. However, the only real tortfeasor in an implied indemnity action is the indemnitor, who commits the tort which causes injury.
In product liability cases, the manufacturer is often the culpable tortfeasor as a result of conduct associated with designing or manufacturing a defective product. Product liability law in this State permits a plaintiff to recover where the plaintiff can prove a product was defective when it left the manufacturer and the defective product was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries. Morningstar v. Black & Decker Mfg. Co., 162 W.Va. 857, 253 S.E.2d 666, 677 (1979). Strict liability in tort relieves the plaintiff from proving the manufacturer was negligent, and instead permits proof of the defective condition of the product as the basis for liability. Because the product manufacturer is not always accessible to the plaintiff, strict liability extends to those in the product's chain of distribution. Thus, an innocent seller can be subject to liability that is entirely derivative simply by virtue of being present in the chain of distribution of the defective product.
Extending liability to those in the chain of distribution in this manner is meant to further the public policy that an injured party not have to bear the cost of his injuries simply because the product manufacturer is out of reach. The liability of a party in the chain of distribution is based solely upon its relationship to the product and is not related to any negligence or malfeasance. For this reason, this Court acknowledged the right of *158 implied indemnity in note 22 of Morningstar, supra. In syllabus point 1 of Hill v. Joseph T. Ryerson & Son, 165 W.Va. 22, 268 S.E.2d 296 (1980), we held that "[a] seller who does not contribute to the defect in a product may have an implied indemnity remedy against the manufacturer of the product, when the seller is sued by the user." "[I]n the field of product liability, the concept underlying allowance of indemnity is that the indemnitee has been rendered liable because of a nondelegable duty arising out of common or statutory law, but the actual cause of the injury has been the act of another person." Hill, 268 S.E.2d at 301. The remedy of implied indemnity provides an innocent seller, or indemnitee, with the means to seek restitution from the actual wrongdoer, or indemnitor.
Again, we emphasize that the right to seek implied indemnity belongs only to a party who is without fault. If a seller in some way contributes to a product defect, the seller and manufacturer are jointly responsible for damages the product causes, and the seller has no right to seek implied indemnity. Instead, because of the shared fault, the rules of contribution would apply. However, the rules of both contribution and indemnity could apply where a seller does not contribute to a defect in a product, but commits an independent act of negligence or is at fault in some other manner.
Indemnification is a remedy available to innocent parties who have been held strictly liable and made to pay for injuries caused by others. It would defeat all notions of fairness and equity to deprive an innocent party of the means to seek reimbursement from a culpable manufacturer simply because that manufacturer reached a "good faith" settlement with the injured plaintiff. Velsicol now complains that: "Notwithstanding Velsicol's good faith, its payment of substantial proceeds to plaintiffs, and its motivation to buy peace, Velsicol has not obtained peace. Velsicol has instead bought only the risk of continued liability via implied indemnification claims and the burden of having to continue to defend its products."
However, we believe if Velsicol truly wanted to "buy peace," then, as the manufacturer of the allegedly defective product, Velsicol should have included lesser defendants in the chain of distribution within the terms of the settlement agreement, thereby eliminating its own risk of continued liability via implied indemnification claims. If chlordane is determined to be a defective product, and it is also determined the non-settling defendants did nothing independently wrong or in no way contributed to the defect, then equity demands that Velsicol indemnify the non-settling defendants if they are ultimately found liable for damages caused by its product.
Therefore, our answer to the certified question is negative: In a multiparty product liability lawsuit, a good faith settlement between the plaintiff(s) and the manufacturing defendant who is responsible for the defective product will not extinguish the right of a non-settling defendant to seek implied indemnification when the liability of the non-settling defendant is predicated not on its own independent fault or negligence, but on a theory of strict liability.
In fact, it is arguable that basic fairness and sound public policy dictate that a settlement by a plaintiff with the manufacturing defendant solely responsible for the defective product covers all damages caused by that product and extinguishes any right of the plaintiff to pursue others in the chain of distribution who did not make the product, contribute in any way to the defect, or commit any independent acts of negligence or fault. However, this issue was not raised by this certified question, and we leave its resolution for a later time.

NOTES
[1]  Pursuant to an administrative order entered by this Court on 18 November 1994, the Honorable Fred L. Fox, II, Judge of the Sixteenth Judicial Circuit, was assigned to sit as a member of the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals commencing 1 January 1995 and continuing through 31 March 1995, because of the physical incapacity of Justice W.T. Brotherton, Jr. On 14 February 1995 a subsequent administrative order extended this assignment until further order of said Court.
[2]  The defendant BOE states that in October 1987 the EPA issued a Final Cancellation Order prohibiting all sale, use, or distribution of chlordane after 15 April 1988.
[3]  The non-settling defendants who objected to the settlement were the Kanawha County Board of Education and Robert Klatzkin, Bruce Terminex of West Virginia, Inc., Terminex International Company, L.P., and Forshaw Distribution, Inc.

According to the defendant BOE, Forshaw Distribution, Inc., a distributor of chlordane, was sued because it sold chlordane to a commercial applicator. Forshaw and other defendants have since settled. The Board, Alford Termite & Pest Control (which has not participated in the defense of this case), and General Exterminating (which has not entered an appearance in this case) are remaining defendants.

[6]  Although indemnification and contribution are separate and distinct legal concepts, leading commentators have noted that these terms are sometimes incorrectly treated as interchangeable:

There is an important substantive difference between, first, an order distributing loss among tortfeasors by requiring others each to pay a proportionate share to one who has discharged their "joint" liability and, second, an order requiring another to reimburse in full one who has discharged a common liability. In the prevailing usage, the first is referred to as contribution; the second, as indemnity. Because of either confusion or deliberate departure from prevailing usage, however, there are decisions in which full reimbursement has been allowed under the name of contribution, or some form of distribution has been allowed under the name of indemnity.

[7]  We realize this language could again be cited to support the proposition that a good faith settlement between a plaintiff and defendant in a multiparty litigation extinguishes a non-settling defendant's right to seek indemnification from the settling defendant. We believe, however, that the inclusion of "or indemnification" in the Smith case was mere surplusage and, therefore, should be disregarded.

OPINION AND ORDER
JUSTO ARENAS, United States Chief Magistrate Judge.
This matter is before the court on motions by defendants Total Petroleum Puerto Rico Corporation ("Total") and Esso Standard Oil (Puerto Rico), Inc. ("Esso"). *204 On April 29, 2009, Total filed a motion to preclude further participation of plaintiffs in cases 08-1950, 08-1986, and 08-2025. (Docket No. 247.) On May 8, 2009, Esso moved for an entry of final judgment in its favor as to all claims in cases 08-1950, 08-1986, 08-2025, 08-2032, and 08-2044. (Docket No. 248.) Plaintiffs from cases 08-1950, 08-1986, and 08-2025 ("Group I plaintiffs") filed their opposition to the motions filed by Esso and Total on May 11, 2009. (Docket No. 249.) On May 18, 2009, those plaintiffs filed an informative memorandum in further support of their opposition. (Docket No. 252.) Plaintiffs from case 08-2044 and 08-2032 ("Group II plaintiffs") filed oppositions to the entry of final judgment on May 21, 2009 and May 23, 2009, respectively. (Docket Nos. 256, 260.) On June 3, 2009, Total filed a reply[1] to plaintiffs' opposition to the entry of final judgment, and moved to strike plaintiffs' informative motion in further support of their existing opposition motion. (Docket Nos. 267, 268.) For the reasons set forth below, Total's motion is GRANTED and Esso's motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.

I. PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND
The facts of this case have been recounted multiple times. See Santiago-Sepulveda v. Esso Standard Oil Co. (P.R.), 582 F.Supp.2d 154, 156-174 (D.P.R.2008); (Docket Nos. 118, 145, 149, 228.) In March 2008, Esso announced that it would terminate its Puerto Rico gasoline retail franchises, effective September 30, 2008. Id. at 156. The company later changed the effective termination date to October 31, 2008. (Docket No. 41.) On August 26, 2008, a large group of Esso franchisees filed a complaint under the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act ("PMPA") (15 U.S.C. § 2801, et seq.) to enjoin Esso from terminating the franchises. (Docket No. 2.) Four other complaints were subsequently filed in four separate cases, all of which were consolidated into this one. (Docket No. 46.) On September 4, the retailer plaintiffs in the consolidated case (Civil No. 08-1950) moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent Esso from terminating their franchises. (Docket No. 7.) Total moved to intervene in the consolidated cases on September 9, 2008, as the motion for preliminary injunction posed a threat to Total's plans to purchase the gasoline retail stations whose franchises Esso sought to terminate. (Docket No. 10.) On September 17, 2008, this case was referred to me, and on October 9, 2008, I granted Total's motion to intervene. (Docket Nos. 30, 91.)
On October 7, 2008, I issued an order acknowledging an agreement between the Group II plaintiffs and the defendants, and retaining supervision and jurisdiction over the parties until final resolution of the matter. (Docket No. 81.) On October 18, 2008, I issued an opinion and order denying plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction. (Docket No. 118.) On October 29, 2008, plaintiffs in case 08-1986 announced that they had agreed to accept the franchise agreements offered by Total. (Docket No. 146.) Between that date and October 31, 2008, all but two plaintiffs signed agreements with Total. (Docket No. 157, at 5, ¶ 2.)
In the time since that date, the parties appear to have been adhering to their *205 mutual obligations under the contract. Esso and Total now contend that this court has already deemed them compliant with the PMPA. Thus, Esso argues for entry of final judgment and Total moves for "an order precluding [Group I plaintiffs] to [sic] appear in any further proceedings....." (Docket No. 247, at 7.) Plaintiffs, however, argue that the court has decided only that a permanent injunction will not issue against Total and Esso. (Docket No. 249, at 2.) They contend that they are still entitled to a ruling on the legality of the franchise contracts, which Total offered to them on a "take it or leave it" basis. (Docket No. 155, at 3.) In plaintiffs' view, final judgment may not be entered before such a ruling.
The franchise agreement offered to plaintiffs by Total consists of three separate contracts: a Lease Contract, a Franchise Contract for Total's convenience store enterprise known as "Bonjour," and a Sale and Supply Contract. (Docket Nos. 155, at 3, 155-4.) Plaintiffs have argued that the following provisions of those contracts are illegal and should not be imposed upon them:
Paragraph 2 of Article 4.1 of the Lease Contract:
The Retailer [plaintiffs] expressly acknowledges that the Company shall be entitled to lease to third parties parts or portions of the lands or structures where the Station is located, and that the Retailer shall have no right to discounts or credits of any kind as a consequence of the above.
(Docket No. 108-3, at 3.)
Article 4.4 of the Lease Contract:
[T]he parties agree that the Minimum Rent may be increased to account for any additional investment the Company [Total] may make ... at any time while this Contract is in effect ... at its sole and absolute discretion.
(Docket No. 108-3, at 4.)
Article 11.2 of the "Bonjour" Franchise Contract:
The Retailer agrees to purchase for sale at the store only those Products and Services of the type, brand and quality recommended and/or approved by the Company.... The Retailer agrees to purchase only from those suppliers and providers authorized by the Company.... The retailer must refrain from selling any product or service that is not authorized by the Company....
(Docket No. 155-4, at 15.)
Article 9.3 of the "Bonjour" Franchise Contract-Non-Competition Agreement:
The Retailer agrees, for the duration of the Contract, and for an additional period of twelve (12) months after its termination or expiration, not to engage in or acquire any interest, directly or indirectly, in a convenience store type of business within the territorial jurisdiction of the municipality where the BONJOUR Franchise object of this agreement is located, or any adjoining municipality. The Retailer will be deemed to be engaged in such business indirectly if he is an employee, officer, director, trustee, agent or partner of a person, firm, corporation, association, partnership, trust, or any other legal entity that is engaged in such a business within the aforementioned area. The above shall not be understood as a prohibition from having any interest in a corporation or entity for investment purposes without intending to acquire control or majority interest in securities traded in a recognized stock market.
(Docket No. 155-4, at 11.)
Article 8.1 of the Sale and Supply ContractDiscontinuation, Substitution of Products:

*206 The Company shall have the absolute right to discontinue or subtitute [sic] any engine fuel, petroleum product or any of the Total Products object of this Contract for industrial reasons, inventory reasons, world-wide supply of materials, or for marketing or competition decisions, and the retailer agrees to acquire the substitute products as long as the Company sells them within the Territory instead of the substituted product.
(Docket No. 155-5, at 8.)
Each of the three contracts also contains language relating to the interpretation of the contracts themselves:
This Contract shall be interpreted consistent with and governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
(Lease Agreement, Article 19.1, Docket No. 108-3, at 21; Franchise Contract, Article 17.1, Docket No. 155-4, at 24; Sale and Supply Contract, Article 23.1, Docket No. 155-5, at 23.) All three contracts also provide for the severability of contract terms under certain circumstances:
The intention of the parties appearing herein is for all provisions on this Contract to be complied with in their entirety as allowed by law. Therefore, should a court with jurisdiction find that the scope of some of the provisions is too broad to be complied with as written, the intention of the parties is that the court must modify such provision until its scope is one that the court finds may be enforceable. However, should any provision in this Contract be found to be unlawful, invalid, or unenforceable under present or future laws, said provisions shall be nullified; this Contract shall be interpreted and governed as if said unlawful, invalid or unenforceable provision had never been a part thereof, and the rest of the provisions in this Contract shall remain in force and will not be affected by the unlawful, invalid or unenforceable provision or its elimination.
(Lease Agreement, Article 20.10, Docket No. 108-3, at 23; Franchise Contract, Article 18.3, Docket No. 155-4, at 25; Sale and Supply Contract, Article 24.3, Docket No. 155-5, at 24.)

II. DISCUSSION

A. Prior Rulings
The first issue is the extent to which I may order relief to plaintiffs in light of prior rulings in this case. Total suggests that final judgment has already been issued in this case. (Docket No. 268, at 4, ¶ 15.) It has not. Nowhere in any opinion or order issued by the court in this case has there appeared an order for entry of judgment. Nor has any judgment been entered into the civil docket under Rule 79(a). Fed.R.Civ.P. 58(c)(1)-(2) (judgment is only entered when "the judgment is entered in the civil docket under Rule 79(a)."). Indeed, if judgment had already issued, Esso would not be moving for entry of final judgment. (Docket No. 248.) See Total Petroleum P.R. Corp. v. Torres-Caraballo, 631 F.Supp.2d 130 (D.P.R. 2009).
Both parties suggest that judgment is appropriate because the decisions already made by the court leave nothing left to rule upon. It is true that I held in the opinion and order issued on October 18, 2008 that "Esso has complied with the notice requirements under the PMPA, and Total's offering of nondiscriminatory franchise contracts generally complies with Esso's obligation to assure that its franchisee is offered a non-discriminatory contract...." Santiago-Sepulveda v. Esso Standard Oil Co. (P.R.), 582 F.Supp.2d at 185. I have acknowledged that "Esso and Total ... had complied with the requirements of the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act...." (Docket No. 197, at 2; see *207 also Docket No. 228, at 20-21.) Those holdings remain effective. Plaintiffs are correct, however, that my denial of plaintiffs' motion to enjoin the termination of their franchises was not the same as a declaration that all terms of the franchise agreements are valid. See Riverdale Enter., Inc. v. Shell Oil Co., 41 F.Supp.2d. 56, 68 (D.Mass.1999) (finding franchisor justified in terminating franchise under the PMPA despite a finding that at least one term of replacement franchise offer was impermissible); Coast Vill. Inc. v. Equilon Enter., LLC, 163 F.Supp.2d 1136, 1180-1181 (C.D.Cal.2001) (same). Indeed, the only controlling issue in the October opinion was "whether a permanent injunction will issue." Santiago-Sepulveda v. Esso Standard Oil Co. (P.R.), 582 F.Supp.2d at 185. While I did tangentially discuss some specific contractual provisions, I concluded only that "[t]he proposed Total terms are not subject to court-ordered modification at this time." Santiago-Sepulveda v. Esso Standard Oil Co. (P.R.), 582 F.Supp.2d at 182 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the issue of whether the terms of Total's franchise offers are acceptable has been reserved to this point.
Even if I had made a finding on the legality of certain contract terms, this would not constrain my power to modify such a finding. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) provides that "any order or other decision, however designated, that adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties ... may be revised at any time before the entry of a judgment adjudicating all the claims...." Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). Moreover, "the law of the case doctrine does not prevent a judge from changing his mind, so long as there was an explanation and the court took into account justified reliance." City of Bangor v. Citizens Commc'ns Co., 532 F.3d 70, 100 (1st Cir. 2008) (citing Fiori v. Truck Drivers, Local 170, 354 F.3d 84, 90 (1st Cir.2004)). Here, neither party has indicated that it has placed any detrimental reliance on the contractual provisions at issue. I am therefore not prevented from addressing the legality of the contractual provisions about which plaintiffs complain.

B. Section 2805(f) of the PMPA
The next issue is whether the PMPA provides a basis for relief if any of Total's terms are found illegal. Section 2805(f) of the PMPA provides:
No franchisor shall require, as a condition of entering into or renewing the franchise relationship, a franchisee to release or waive ... any right that the franchisee may have under any valid and applicable State law.
15 U.S.C. § 2805(f)(1)(B). There is some question as to whether section 2805(f) provides an independent remedy under the PMPA, especially where, as here, the franchisee has already accepted the franchisor's offer. The First Circuit has yet to interpret section 2805(f) explicitly, but it has found that the Act "requires that franchisees faced with objectionable contract terms refrain from ratifying those terms by executing the contracts (even `under protest') and operating under them" if they wish to be protected under the PMPA. Marcoux v. Shell Oil Prods. Co. LLC, 524 F.3d 33, 49 (1st Cir.2008), cert. granted by Mac's Shell Serv. v. Shell Oil Prod. Co. LLC, 2009 WL 1650201 (U.S. Jun.15, 2009) and cert. granted by Shell Oil Prod. Co. LLC v. Mac's Shell Serv., Inc., 2009 WL 1650202 (U.S. Jun.15, 2009). That holding parallels a Seventh Circuit ruling explicitly interpreting section 2805(f): if a "statutory `franchise' has been renewed, [the] franchisee must seek redress at the state level to enforce its contract rights under the franchise agreementi.e., violations of § 2805(f)(1) that do not constitute a non-renewal under the *208 PMPA but are instead ordinary contract disputes." Dersch Energies, Inc. v. Shell Oil Co. & Equilon Enter., Inc., 314 F.3d 846, 865-66 (7th Cir.2002).
In this case, all but two plaintiffs ratified the terms of Total's offer over seven months ago. There is therefore reason to question plaintiffs' right to contest contractual terms at this stage in the litigation. This case, however, differs materially form Marcoux and Dersch. Whereas "[t]he stumbling block" for plaintiffs in Marcoux and Dersch was that they did not "insist on receiving notices of [franchise] nonrenewal," Marcoux v. Shell Oil Prod. Co. LLC, 524 F.3d at 49, before signing new agreements, plaintiffs in this case received notices of franchise termination in March, 2008 and filed suit before the effective termination date. Santiago-Sepulveda v. Esso Standard Oil Co. (P.R.), 582 F.Supp.2d at 156. Whereas there was neither actual franchise termination nor constructive nonrenewal in Marcoux and Dersch, there was actual franchise termination here. Where there was no jurisdiction under section 2802 of the PMPA in those cases, there is in this case. Accordingly, Marcoux and Dersch do not operate to preclude recovery for plaintiffs under section 2805(f). Given that this court has jurisdiction under the PMPA, there is no reason not to apply a plain reading of section 2805(f). Thus, plaintiffs may have a remedy under section 2805(f) if they can demonstrate the illegality of any of Total's contractual terms.

C. Legality of Terms

1. Leases to Third Parties
Article 4.1 of the Lease Agreement permits Total to lease portions of the leased premises to third parties, and provides that plaintiffs "shall have no right to discount or credits of any kind as a consequence...." (Docket No. 108-3, at 3.) "Under Puerto Rico law, three elements characterize a lease contract: (1) the thing; (2) temporal duration; and (3) a price." Pico Vidal v. Ruiz Alvarado, 377 B.R. 788, 794 (D.P.R.2007) (citing In re Daben Corp., 469 F.Supp. 135, 148 (D.P.R. 1979)). "Unlike the common law, the civil law allows that a leased thing not be entirely defined." In re Daben, 469 F.Supp. 135 at 148. "The enjoyment and use of the [leased] premises," however, is "the essence of the lease agreement." Nolla v. Joa Co. of Fla., 102 D.P.R. 428, 2 P.R. Offic. Trans. 538, 541 (1974) (finding lessee was entitled to compensation from a third party that had taken possession of validly leased premises during the lease period).
Article 4.1 borders on the unconscionable. Under the Article's terms, Total would have the right to lease 99% of a given gasoline retail station to a third party while still charging the franchisee 100% of the rent expense. While Puerto Rico law does not require that the "leased thing" be entirely defined, it must still be at least identifiable. Article 4.1 simply leaves too much room for arbitrary or discriminatory actions by Total. See Avramidis v. Atl. Richfield Co., 623 F.Supp. 64, 67 (D.Mass.1985) ("[W]ithout stated standards, [the franchisor] could apply the [pricing scheme] in an arbitrary, or even discriminatory[ ] manner....").
Moreover, Article 4.1 defies the spirit, if not the letter of Puerto Rico's Department of Consumer Affairs Rental Regulation Number 2823, Section 6, Article 10,[2] which limits the rent charged in connection with a lease of a gasoline station to 10% of the market value of the station to be rented. If "the station to be rented" includes only *209 that portion of the premises occupied the franchisee, the fair market value of that "station" could become quite small if Total leases a significant portion of the premises to a third party. In that situation, the full rental price charged by Total may come to exceed 10% of the market value of the remaining area occupied by plaintiffs. This would contravene Regulation 2823. Accordingly, I find that Article 4.1 requires the franchisees to waive existing rights under state law and is therefore impermissible under section 2805(f) in its present form. Total is within its rights to lease portions of its station to third parties, but it may not insist that "the Retailer shall have no right to discounts or credits of any kind as a consequence" of such third party leases.

2. Additional Rent
Article 4.4 of the Lease Agreement provides that the rent "may be increased to account for any additional investment [Total] may make ... at its sole and absolute discretion." (Docket No. 108-3, at 4.) In Puerto Rico, "[t]he rules for determination of price in purchase and sales agreements are applicable to leases." In re Daben Corp., 469 F.Supp. at 148. The rules for determination of price in purchase and sales agreements provide that "[t]he determination of the price can never be left to the judgment of one of the contracting parties." P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 3745. Here, the determination of rent is explicitly and exclusively left to the judgment of Total. Under Article 4.4, if Total wishes to increase the rent charged to the retailer, it may do so unilaterally by an additional investment in the retail station. The retailer would have no say in the matter. There is no law prohibiting Total from investing in its service stations or from negotiating with its franchisees for a fair contribution to absorb the associated cost. Article 4.4 of the Lease Agreement is, however, invalid to the extent it allows Total to take these actions "at its sole and absolute discretion."

3. Restrictions on Products and Services Purchased
Article 11.2 of the Franchise Contract provides that "[t]he Retailer agrees to purchase only from those suppliers and providers authorized by the Company...." (Docket No. 155-4, at 15.) Law No. 77 of June 25, 1964, created Puerto Rico's Office of Monopolistic Affairs, and vested it with the power "[t]o promulgate... such rules and regulations as may be necessary and proper for the enforcement of [the legislative Act on Monopolies and Restraint of Trade]." P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10, § 272(5). The rules and regulations of the Office of Monopolistic Affairs "have the force of law" once approved. Id. Article 4(e) of Regulation I (Number 994) of the Office of Monopolistic Affairs was approved on August 19, 1965, in conformity with Law No. 77. It is still effective.[3] Article 4(e) provides that it is illegal, in a gasoline franchise relationship, "to compel or attempt to compel the retailers to sell products manufactured, distributed, endorsed, or in any way favored by the distributors."[4] Total is thus proscribed from requiring plaintiffs to sell the products it endorses or favors. To the extent it does so, Article 11.2 of the Franchise Contract is illegal.


*210 4. Non-Compete Agreements
Article 9.3 of the Franchise Contract prohibits the retailer from engaging in "a convenience store type of business within the territorial jurisdiction of the municipality where the Bonjour Franchise object of [the] agreement is located, or any adjoining municipality" for "an additional period of twelve (12) months" after the contract's expiration. (Docket No. 155-4, at 11.) Under Puerto Rico law, noncompetition clauses are subject to four conditions. Arthur Young & Co. v. Vega III, 136 D.P.R. 157, 275, 1994 P.R.-Eng. 909262 at 15 (1994). "First, the employer must have a legitimate interest in [the] agreement, that is, if the employer were not protected by a noncompetition clause, his business could be seriously affected." Arthur Young & Co. v. Vega III, 136 D.P.R. at 175, 1994 P.R.Eng. 909262 at 15-16. Here, Total has a valid commercial interest in protecting its brand and its trade secrets, which are in the midst of a delicate transition phase in the Puerto Rico market. "Second, the scope of the prohibition must fit the employer's interest, insofar as object, time, and place of the restriction or clients is concerned.... The noncompetition term should not exceed twelve months...." Arthur Young & Co. v. Vega III, 136 D.P.R. at 175, 1994 P.R.-Eng. 909262 at 16. Here, the Total's term is for exactly twelve months, and the clause circumscribes the restrictions on the retailers to "convenience store type of business." (Docket No. 155-4, at 11.) "Third, the employer shall offer a consideration in exchange for the employee signing the noncompetition covenant." Arthur Young & Co. v. Vega III, 136 D.P.R. at 176, 1994 P.R.-Eng. 909262 at 17. In the employment context, such "consideration could even be that a candidate gets the position he wished for in the company." Id. Analogizing this rule to the present franchise relationship context, I find that it is sufficient that the franchisees got "the position [they] wished for" as franchisees of the Total brand. Finally, the fourth requirement of Arthur Youngthat the non-compete agreement be reduced to writinghas also been satisfied here. Id. Accordingly, I find that the non-compete agreement is valid under Puerto Rico law.

5. Non-Branded Gasoline.
Article 8.1 of the Sale and Supply Contract reserves for Total the right to discontinue or substitute any engine fuel, petroleum product or any of the Total Products for other products under a variety of enumerated reasons. (Docket No. 155-5, at 8.) I have addressed the issue of unbranded gasoline at length in my most recent opinion and order at Docket No. 287. The ruling of that decision was based on plaintiffs' request for an injunction against the use of allegedly unbranded gasoline; it did not address the legality of Article 8.1. The law and the reasoning I applied in that decision are nonetheless equally availing here, and I incorporate that opinion and order herein, mutatis mutandis. Under the PMPA, there is no requirement that Total provide only gasoline refined by Total itself. Accordingly, there is nothing illegal about Article 8.1.

D. Severability
Given that Articles 4.1 and 4.4 of the Lease Contract and Article 11.2 of the Franchise Contract all violate section 2805(f) of the PMPA to some extent, the next issue is what remedy to afford plaintiffs. I find that each of these clauses is severable to the extent they are declared invalid above. Each of the three contracts offered by Total contains an explicit severance or "savings clause." "[S]hould any provision in [the] Contract be found to be unlawful, invalid, or unenforceable under present or future laws, said provisions shall be nullified," and the contract should be treated as if the violative provision never *211 existed. (Docket No. 108-3, at 23, art. 20.10.) "[T]he rest of the provisions in [the] Contract shall remain in force...." (Id.) The First Circuit approves the use of a standard "savings clause:"
A "savings clause" preemptively resolves conflicts between contract language and applicable law in order to preserve the remaining, non-conflicting contract language. "Savings clause" is somewhat of a misnomer. The contractual language in conflict with applicable law is not saved. The non-conflicting language is saved. In the absence of a savings clause, the decision maker, be it an arbitrator or a court, decides the remedy for resolving a conflict between contract language and applicable law. That remedy, driven by an assessment of the intent of the parties, could be as small as severance of the offending contract language, or it could extend to outright non-enforcement of portions of the contract that include the offending contract language or the contract in its entirety. In essence, a savings clause serves as an expression of the intent of the parties that limits the remedies an arbitrator or court may use in situations of conflict between contract terms and applicable law.
Kristian v. Comcast Corp., 446 F.3d 25, 48 n. 16 (1st Cir.2006) (severing a portion of arbitration agreement where the savings clause in question "emphasize[d] the use of severance as a remedy," and declaring the remainder of the contract valid); see Cherena v. Coors Brewing Co., 20 F.Supp.2d 282, 286 (D.P.R.1998) (doing the same with regard to a non-competition covenant); see also Coast Vill. v. Equilon Enter., LLC, 163 F.Supp.2d at 1180 (citing Graham Oil Co. v. ARCO Prods. Co., 43 F.3d 1244, 1248-49 (9th Cir.1994)) ("[T]he Ninth Circuit has expressly held that invalidation under Section 2805(f) does not lead to invalidation of the entire agreement so long as the term(s) are severable from the rest of the agreement."). It is true that "a `contract is entire, and not severable, when, by its terms, nature, and purpose, it contemplates and intends that each and all of its parts, and material provisions are common to the other, and interdependent.'" Graham Oil Co. v. ARCO Prods. Co., 43 F.3d at 1248 (quoting Hudson v. Wylie, 242 F.2d 435, 446 (9th Cir.1957)). Here, however, the clear intent of the parties as expressed in the contract is that any invalid terms be severed from the contract in order to save the remainder of the agreement. The essence of the agreementthe existence of a franchise relationshipremains in tact in the absence of the three severable clauses. Accordingly, those contract provisions that violate Puerto Rico law are to be severed, while the remainder of the three contracts is binding and enforceable.

III. SUMMARY
Esso and Total have complied with the PMPA. Total's franchise agreements with the Group I plaintiffs are valid with the exception of the following provisions, which are hereby PROHIBITED from appearing in any contract between the parties:
 Those portions of Article 4.1 of the Lease Contract that permit Total to lease to third parties parts or portions of the lands or structures where the station is located without allowing plaintiffs the right to discounts or credits. (See Article 4.1 of the Lease Contract, Docket No. 108-3, at 3.)
 Those portions of Article 4.4 of the Lease Contract that permit Total to increase the minimum rent to account for any additional investment Total may make at its sole and absolute discretion. (See Article 4.4 of the Lease Contract, Docket No. 108-3, at 4.)
 Those portions of Article 11.2 of the Franchise contract that require the retailer *212 to purchase only those products and services manufactured, distributed, endorsed, or an any way favored by Total. (See Article 11.2 of the Franchise Contract, Docket No. 155-4 at, 15.)
Finally, it is hereby ORDERED that partial, final, appealable judgment be entered in cases 08-1950, 08-1986, and 08-2025, pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). Such a judgment "as to fewer than all the claims [or parties] in a multi-claim action [is permissible] `upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay.'" Quinn v. City of Boston, 325 F.3d 18, 26 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(b)). The First Circuit bears a "long-settled and prudential policy against the scattershot disposition of litigation," Quinn v. City of Boston, 325 F.3d at 26 (quoting Spiegel v. Trs. of Tufts Coll., 843 F.2d 38, 42 (1st Cir.1988)), but it will nonetheless tolerate such a disposition where a district court "make[s] specific findings and set[s] forth its reasoning," Quinn v. City of Boston, 325 F.3d at 26 (citing Spiegel v. Trs. of Tufts Coll., 843 F.2d at 42), or where "the record, on its face, makes it sufficiently apparent that the circumstances support an appeal from a partial judgment." Quinn v. City of Boston, 325 F.3d at 26 (approving of partial final judgment where the claims upon which partial judgment was entered were distinct from the remaining claims, and where public interest favored immediate appeal) (citing Spiegel v. Trs. of Tufts Coll., 843 F.2d at 43 n. 4).
Here, cases 08-1950, 08-1986, and 08-2025 were filed to enjoin Esso from terminating its Puerto Rico gasoline retail stations. I have denied such an injunction, have concluded that Total and Esso are compliant with the PMPA, and have invoked the severance provisions of Total's franchise contracts in three instances. As to those three cases, there is no just reason for delay because all issues of any substance have now been ruled upon. The public interest would best be served by the rapid resolution of any outstanding points of contention upon immediate appeal. I abstain from entering final judgement in cases 08-2032 and 08-2044 because the parties in those cases reached an agreement in October 2008, over which I am to retain supervision and jurisdiction. (Docket No. 81.)

IV. CONCLUSION
Total's motion (Docket No. 247) is GRANTED. Esso's motion (Docket No. 248) is GRANTED to the extent it requests final judgment as to cases 08-1950, 08-1986, and 08-2025; it is DENIED to the extent it requests final judgment as to cases 08-2032 and 08-2044. Total's motion to strike plaintiffs' informative memorandum (Docket No. 268) is DENIED.
There being no just reason for delay, the Clerk is ORDERED to enter partial final judgment as to cases 08-1950, 08-1986, and 08-2025 dismissing them in their entirety.
SO ORDERED.

v.
YANKTON SIOUX TRIBE, Defendant.
No. CIV 94-4259.
United States District Court, D. South Dakota, Southern Division.
October 12, 1995.

MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
PIERSOL, District Judge.
Plaintiff brought suit against the Defendant Tribe for breach of contract pursuant to seven contracts entered into between Plaintiff and the Tribe's Ft. Randall Casino for billboards to be placed along public highways in an effort to generate business for the Casino. The contracts were signed by the general manager of the Casino on June 4 and September 10 of 1993, and approximately six months later, the Tribe informed Plaintiff that the Yankton Sioux Tribe Business and Claims Committee had not approved the contracts prior to signing, and, therefore, the contracts were "terminated." Doc. 7 at Ex. B. Plaintiff brought the instant action for monies owed under the contracts. Doc. 1. The Tribe moves for dismissal on the grounds of sovereign immunity. Doc. 3.
The Tribe's Motion to Dismiss raises two jurisdictional questions for the Court. First, whether this Court or a tribal court must hear this issue and, second, whether this action is barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.

DISMISSAL PURSUANT TO RULE 12(b)(1)
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) provides for dismissal of an action whenever the court lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter. The Eighth Circuit has distinguished between facial and factual 12(b)(1) motions, stating the standards applicable to motions to dismiss in each instance. In this case, we are concerned with a factual motion:
Because at issue in a factual 12(b)(1) motion is the trial court's jurisdiction  its very power to hear the case  there is substantial authority that the trial court is free to weigh the evidence and satisfy itself as to the existence of its power to hear the case. In short, no presumptive truthfulness attaches to the plaintiff's allegations, and the existence of disputed material facts will not preclude the trial court from evaluating for itself the merits of jurisdictional *201 claims. Moreover, the plaintiff will have the burden of proof that jurisdiction does in fact exist.
Osborn v. United States, 918 F.2d 724, 730 (8th Cir.1990); Titus v. Sullivan, 4 F.3d 590, 593 (8th Cir.1993).

SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION
Federal Courts have original jurisdiction in cases "arising under the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States." 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and in cases in which there is diversity of citizenship and the matter in controversy exceeds the statutory amount, 28 U.S.C. § 1332. Plaintiff argues that this Court has jurisdiction in this contract dispute pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332 and 25 C.F.R. Part 11.
Diversity jurisdiction does not exist. Section 1332 requires that the parties be "citizens of different states." Although Plaintiff has attempted to demonstrate diversity by alleging in its Complaint that Plaintiff is incorporated in Nebraska and that "Defendant is an Indian Tribe with its principal place of business in South Dakota," Doc. 1 at ¶ 4, it is well settled that "Indian tribes are not citizens of any state for purposes of diversity jurisdiction." Gaines v. Ski Apache, 8 F.3d 726, 729 (10th Cir.1993) (citations omitted). Additionally, the Tribe pleads it is organized pursuant to Section 16 of the Indian Reorganization Act, 25 U.S.C. § 476, and has never incorporated under 25 U.S.C. § 477.[1] Doc. 4 at 1. As a "Section 16" entity, the Tribe is not a citizen of any state for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. Standing Rock Sioux Indian Tribe v. Dorgan, 505 F.2d 1135, 1140 (8th Cir.1974); Gaines, 8 F.3d at 729; Veeder v. Omaha Tribe of Nebr., 864 F.Supp. 889, 898-901 (N.D.Iowa 1994).
Plaintiff bases its second argument for federal jurisdiction on 25 C.F.R. § 11.104(b). National Farmers Union Ins. Co. v. Crow Tribe holds that questions of tribal court jurisdiction over non-Indians should first be addressed in tribal court. 471 U.S. 845, 856, 105 S.Ct. 2447, 2454, 85 L.Ed.2d 818 (1985). Plaintiff argues that it cannot bring suit in the tribal forum because § 11.104(b) requires a Tribe with a C.F.R. court to pass a resolution permitting the Tribe to be sued in that court, and the Yankton Sioux Tribe has never passed such a resolution. Therefore, Plaintiff argues it must pursue its rights in the federal forum because the tribal forum is closed to it.
The Tribe's response to the argument that there is no tribal forum is that "The Yankton Sioux Tribe converted its tribal court system from a `CFR Court' to a tribal court of general jurisdiction in June of 1994." Doc. 4 at 2. This assertion, standing alone and unsupported by any evidence, is an insufficient defense to Plaintiff's claim that jurisdiction does not exist in a tribal forum. Federal regulations provide:
The regulations in this part shall continue to apply to tribes listed under § 11.100(a) until a law and order code which includes the establishment of a court system has been adopted by the tribe ... and the Assistant Secretary  Indian Affairs ... has received a valid tribal enactment identifying the effective date of the code's implementation, and the name of the tribe has been deleted from the listing of Courts of Indian Offenses under § 11.100(a). *202 25 C.F.R. § 11.100(c) (1994). The Tribe has made no showing that it has met the requirements of § 11.100(c) and, as of this date,[2] 25 C.F.R. § 11.100(a)(2) retains "Yankton Sioux Tribe (South Dakota)" as one of the tribes to whom the regulations governing Courts of Indian Offenses apply.
The Tenth Circuit has defined one narrow exception[3] to the tribal court exhaustion doctrine of National Farmers Union, 471 U.S. at 856, 105 S.Ct. at 2454. In Dry Creek Lodge, Inc. v. Arapahoe & Shoshone Tribes, the court assumed jurisdiction over plaintiffs' constitutional claims because diversity was lacking and plaintiffs had been denied access to the tribal C.F.R. court. 623 F.2d 682, 685 (10th Cir.1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1118, 101 S.Ct. 931, 66 L.Ed.2d 847 reh'g denied, 450 U.S. 960, 101 S.Ct. 1421, 67 L.Ed.2d 385 (1981) (Dry Creek II). The court stated:
There has to be a forum where the dispute can be settled.... There must exist a remedy for parties in the position of plaintiffs to have the dispute resolved in an orderly manner. To hold that they have access to no court is to hold that they have constitutional rights which have no remedy.
Id. The Court declines to follow the Dry Creek exception. This is a simple contract dispute and raises no issues of constitutional magnitude. See Gila River Indian Community v. Henningson, Durham & Richardson, 626 F.2d 708, 714-15 (9th Cir.1980) (finding no federal jurisdiction for simple breach of contract claim brought by Tribe), and Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Martinez, 519 F.2d 479, 481 (10th Cir.1975) (same). It is doubtful that the Dry Creek exception is the law in this Circuit under any circumstances, but that remains to be determined.
Plaintiff also argues that federal question jurisdiction exists for any contract dispute under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act [IGRA], 25 U.S.C. § 2701 et seq. IGRA does not create a private cause of action for individuals. Tamiami Partners, Ltd. v. Miccosukee Tribe, 63 F.3d 1030, 1049 (11th Cir. 1995).
Because I find the Court has no original or diversity jurisdiction in this matter, I do not reach the question of whether the Tribe may utilize the defense of sovereign immunity, except to comment briefly. The Eighth Circuit has held that nothing except an express waiver will satisfy the Supreme Court's mandate in Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.S. 49, 58, 98 S.Ct. 1670, 1677, 56 L.Ed.2d 106 (1978), stating that a waiver of sovereign immunity "cannot be implied but must be unequivocally expressed." American Indian Agric. Credit Consortium v. Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, 780 F.2d 1374, 1375 (8th Cir.1985). If this Court had jurisdiction, and if the Tribe was a private party, the facts of this case would create a strong case for the application of the doctrine of estoppel. The misrepresentations on the Credit Application which was signed by the general manager, that the Casino was incorporated by the State of South Dakota and that the general manager had authority to enter into contracts on behalf of the Casino would give support to an estoppel argument by a private party. However, the mandate of Santa Clara Pueblo is clear, and even if the facts supporting a finding of estoppel are present, as presupposed for purposes of this motion, estoppel is an insufficient basis from which to find that the Tribe expressly waived its sovereign immunity.
I find that this Court does not have diversity jurisdiction over this contract dispute *203 and that there is no independent federal question jurisdiction. The dismissal of this action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is without prejudice to the right of Plaintiff to pursue an action in the state courts of South Dakota as may be allowed by the applicable gaming compact between the Tribe and the State of South Dakota. Accordingly,
IT IS ORDERED: that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, Docket No. 3, is granted.

JUDGMENT
In accordance with the Memorandum Opinion and Order filed this date with the Clerk,
IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that Defendant's motion to dismiss is granted, and judgment shall be entered for Defendant and against Plaintiff, without prejudice.
NOTES
[1]  Plaintiff states that the Tribe has apparently not formally organized under either Section 16 or Section 17 of the Indian Reorganization Act, and the documentation provided to Plaintiff, and, in turn, to the Court, does not contradict that statement. Doc. 7 at 5, Ex. F. Section 17 of the Indian Reorganization Act, 25 U.S.C. § 477, permits tribes to incorporate, and these corporate entities are then considered citizens of the state of their principal place of business for diversity purposes. Gaines v. Ski Apache, 8 F.3d 726, 729 (10th Cir.1993).

Plaintiff argues that the Tribe should be estopped from making its case that the Tribe is not a corporation and not a citizen of a state for diversity purposes. Plaintiff argues that the Casino's general manager represented to Plaintiff on the Credit Application which was completed at the same time as the first contracts were executed that the Casino was a South Dakota corporation. Doc. 7 at Ex. C. Plaintiff argues that because Plaintiff relied upon the representation that the Casino was incorporated in South Dakota and Plaintiff's belief that, therefore, "the contracts could be enforced" at the time they completed the contracts, the Tribe should be estopped from using the defense that it is not a corporation. Doc. 7 at 6.

[3]  The Tenth Circuit has further narrowed the Dry Creek II exception by applying it only "where plaintiff's rights had been egregiously violated and tribal remedies were wrongfully denied," Seneca-Cayuga Tribe of Okla. v. State, 874 F.2d 709, 715 n. 6 (10th Cir.1989), and basing its application "on the finding that no tribal court forum existed for the non-Indian party." Bank of Okla. v. Muscogee (Creek) Nation, 972 F.2d 1166, 1170 (10th Cir.1992).

The Eighth Circuit has addressed the Dry Creek II decision only in passing. In Shortbull v. Looking Elk, the circuit court affirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment on the grounds that there is no private cause of action under the Indian Civil Rights Act. 677 F.2d 645, 650 (8th Cir.1982). The court merely compared the fact that the plaintiff had no remedy to the lack of a remedy in Dry Creek II. Id.

ORDER AFFIRMING THE RECOMMENDED DECISION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE
SINGAL, Chief Judge.
The United States Magistrate Judge filed with the Court on February 18, 2003 her Recommended Decision. The Petitioner filed his objection to #20 of the Recommended Decision on March 23, 2003 and Respondent filed its objections to Petitioner's Objection and to #20 of the Recommended *177 Decision on April 4, 2003. I have reviewed and considered the Magistrate Judge's Recommended Decision, together with the entire record; I have made a de novo determination of all matters adjudicated by the Magistrate Judge's Recommended Decision; and I concur with the recommendations of the United States Magistrate Judge for the reasons set forth in her Recommended Decision, and determine that no further proceeding is necessary.
1. It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the Magistrate Judge is hereby AFFIRMED.

2. The Court ORDERS as follows:
Petitioner's Motions to Quash, Docket Nos. 3, 4, and 8 are DENIED.

Petitioner's Motions to Quash, Docket No. 16 and so much of Docket No. 4 as relates to First Citizens Bank and United Kingfield Bank are DISMISSED based upon lack of jurisdiction.
The United States' Motion to Dismiss (Docket No. 5) is DISMISSED as moot.
The United States' Motion to Dismiss (Docket No. 17) relating to Jacy Richardson is GRANTED.
The United States' Motions for Partial Enforcement (as to all entities except Trent Jones and the Ichabod Trust) are GRANTED (Docket Nos. 12 and 14).

RECOMMENDED DECISION
KRAVCHUK, United States Magistrate Judge.
Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Special Agent Debra Sousa is conducting an investigation into the federal income tax liabilities of Richard J. Thomas for the tax years 1995 through 2001. In due course Sousa issued summonses to various entities in furtherance of the investigation. Those summonses directed the third party record keepers to produce any and all records they held relating to Richard Thomas and all related entities, including Joan M. Thomas, Center for Natural Healing, Trent R. Jones, Trustee, Ichabod Trust, Three Crows Corporation, and Richard Thomas. Thomas has objected to those summonses by filing motions to quash the IRS summonses. The United States has responded to the motions to quash with both its objection thereto and its own motions to enforce the summonses and to dismiss petitioner's motions. I will provide a scorecard:

     Docket No. 17       December 10, 2002                  Jacy Richardson
                                                            Motion to Dismiss only

I now recommend that the Court Deny petitioner's motions to quash the summonses (Docket Nos. 3, 4, 8, & 16). I further recommend that the Court Grant the Internal Revenue Service's motions to partially enforce the summonses (Docket Nos. 12 & 14) and Grant its motion to dismiss the motion to quash relating to the summons issued to Jacy Richardson (Docket No. 17).

I. The Motions to Quash[2]
The United States concedes that the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) §§ 7609(b)(2)(A) and (c)(2)(E) generally permit a taxpayer to bring a proceeding to quash an IRS summons issued by a Special Agent pursuant to IRC § 7602 to a third-party record keeper. This court's jurisdiction to hear such a petition is found at § 7609(h). Section 7609(b)(2) which allows a proceeding such as this one has been construed as a waiver of sovereign immunity. Stringer v. United States, 776 F.2d 274, 275 (11th Cir.1985). Where a statutory scheme authorizes a claim against the United States and sets a time limit for filing that claim, the tribunal in which the claim is filed has jurisdiction only if the claim is filed within the time allowed. Clay v. United States, 199 F.3d 876, 879-81 (6th Cir.1999). Under § 7609(b)(2)(A) a taxpayer must "begin a proceeding to quash [the] summons not later than the 20th day after the day ... notice is given."
Petitioner received notice of the summons to First Citizens Bank and United Kingfield Bank by certified mail to the *179 petitioner on August 27, 2002. He had twenty days, or until September 16, 2002, to file his motion. He filed it September 18, two days late, and this court therefore lacks jurisdiction to hear his motion as to First Citizens or United Kingfield Banks. As to those two entities the motion to quash should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. However, even if the court had jurisdiction to entertain the motions, they would fail for the same reasons as the motions to quash fail as to the other nine third-party record keepers.
Thomas's three primary motions to quash all raise similar grounds. They are all captioned "Petition to Quash Third Party Summons Controverted by counter affidavit." The pleading itself, signed by Thomas under affirmation, is set forth in sixteen separate sections, ranging from a jurisdictional statement (HI) to a request for recovery of costs (1116). Sandwiched in between are fourteen separate claims that the IRS violated regulations, used improper forms, acted beyond its authority, and otherwise failed to comply with applicable statutory provisions and regulatory schemes. Thomas concludes with the affirmation "[a]ggrieved Party further states that Aggrieved Party has never operated in a regulated excise taxable source activity or industry."
The United States has distilled nine separate and distinct arguments from Thomas's motions. In his reply to the United States' response Thomas does not dispute the United States characterization of his primary arguments but merely attempts to raise some new issues pertaining to Debra Sousa's Declaration filed in support of the motions seeking partial enforcement of the summonses. Therefore I will accept that the issues are as framed by the United States in its response (Docket No. 12 at 4; Docket No. 14 at 8). For the reasons set forth by the United States at pages 5 through 12(Docket No 12) and pages 9 through 15 (Docket No. 14), none of these arguments has any merit whatsoever. I see no need to rehash the points made therein.
I do note that the gist of Thomas's various motions appears in large measure to rest upon his contention that the IRS has somehow exceeded its enforcement authority because he and his various business entities have never been involved in any activity relating to items that would be taxable under the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Division of the Treasury Department. That fact appears to be the genesis of his affirmation under oath. He argues that because there are regulations governing the issuance of summonses that are lodged under the authority of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms of the Department of the Treasury, the IRS has no authority to issue summonses when conducting investigations of matters not related to alcohol, tobacco, or firearms.
Thomas's argument is not novel and it has been rejected by numerous courts in the past. See, e.g., United States v. Streett, 791 F.Supp. 563, 568 (D.Md. 1992) ("The patent flaw in the argument is that the cited ATF regulations are not the exclusive source of the government's authority to issue summonses under § 7602 of the Code."). The IRS has both statutory and regulatory authority to issue summonses and the statutory authority granted by § 7602 extends to "any person." Id.; see also United States v. Stoecklin, 848 F.Supp. 1521, 1525 (M.D.Fla., 1994) (rejecting subject matter jurisdiction challenge mounted by a petitioner asserting that failure to promulgate specific regulations regarding summons pertaining to income tax was fatal and declaring "[regulatory embellishment is unnecessary because enforcement procedure is clearly set forth in the statutes," citing 26 U.S.C. § 7602 et seq.). It appears to me that in all material *180 respects the United States complied with the required statutory procedures. The motion to quash as to nine of the third party record keepers enumerated above should be denied and it should be dismissed as to two of the entities because it is not timely.

II. The Motions to Enforce
The IRS requests that this court issue an order compelling the enforcement of the summonses for the records relating to Richard Thomas, Joan Thomas, Center for Natural Healing and Three Crows Corporation.[3] To obtain judicial enforcement of a summons the IRS must establish: (1) the investigation is being conducted for a legitimate purpose; (2) the inquiry may be relevant to that purpose; (3) the information sought is not already in the IRS's possession; and (4) the administrative steps required by the IRC have been followed. United States v. Powell, 379 U.S. 48, 57 -58, 85 S.Ct. 248, 13 L.Ed.2d 112 (1964). To establish a prima facie case for enforcement, the IRS need do no more than file an affidavit of an agent involved in the investigation setting forth good faith compliance with the Powell requirements. See United States v. Dynavac, Inc., 6 F.3d 1407, 1414 (9th Cir.1993); United States v. Medlin, 986 F.2d 463, 466 (11th Cir.1993); Hintze v. IRS, 879 F.2d 121, 126 (4th Cir.1989), overruled on other grounds by Church of Scientology of Col. v. United States, 506 U.S. 9, 113 S.Ct. 447, 121 L.Ed.2d 313 (1992); accord United States v. Gertner, 65 F.3d 963, 966 (1st Cir.1995) ("[T]he IRS must make a prima facie showing that it is acting in good faith and for a lawful purpose. This burden is not taxing, so to speak. Courts repeatedly have confirmed that an affidavit of the investigating agent attesting to satisfaction of the four Powell elements is itself adequate to make the requisite prima facie showing.").
The First Circuit explained in Gertner: "Once this minimal showing has been made, the burden shifts to the taxpayer to rebut the good-faith presumption that arises in consequence of the government's prima facie case." 65 F.3d at 967. The taxpayer is not required to conclusively disprove the prima facie case, but he must cite some significant facts or otherwise bring to light some serious weaknesses in the government's proffer before the court will hold an evidentiary hearing or otherwise be called upon to weigh the facts and draw the appropriate inferences. Id. If the taxpayer does not raise these substantial questions in the court's mind, the government's affidavit will carry the day. Id.
Applying the Powell framework to the case before me, it becomes readily apparent that the IRS is entitled to an order enforcing its summonses. The affidavit of Debra Sousa, special agent for the IRS, filed in support of the IRS motion, is a classic example of compliance with the barebones requirements, albeit in a conclusory fashion. However, the affidavit does establish all of the necessary prerequisites. Sousa explains that she is conducting an investigation of Thomas connected with the administration or enforcement of the internal revenue laws for the tax years in question and there has been no Justice Department referral for the tax years in question, that is, its investigation is being conducted for a proper purpose. She further advises that the records she seeks are for Thomas and his related family member and/or business entities and that she has served the summons on his creditors or other third parties with whom he has had *181 financial dealings, that is, the information sought may be relevant to the investigation. Sousa averred in H 15 that the IRS did not already have in its possession the information sought by the summons, satisfying the third of the Powell requirements. Finally Sousa maintains that all of the procedural requirements of the IRC have been met, with the exception that notice of the summonses was not provided to Trent R. Jones or the Ichabod Trust and enforcement is not sought as to those entities, thus satisfying the fourth and final Powell requirement.
In his answer to the motion to dismiss Thomas has attempted to meet his burden and rebut the showing made in the affidavit. (Docket No. 19.) He claims that Debra Sousa has failed to produce any bona fide evidence that she is in fact a special agent. To the contrary she has produced such evidence through her affidavit. He also complains of perceived procedural irregularities and reiterates his unsupported claim that Sousa must spell out in her affidavit exactly what facts she intends to uncover. He also claims that some of the years sought may be beyond applicable statutes of limitation. Assuming such is the case, the requirement is that the information sought be relevant and there is no reason given as to why the records from those years would not be relevant to a determination of tax liability. Mystifyingly, Thomas also suggests that "the IMFOLT indicates that there is a criminal investigation. (Exhibit "E") The Transaction Code 914 indicates such investigation." I gather that this statement is in opposition to Sousa's sworn statement denying a referral to the Justice Department. A couple of problems arise: (1) Thomas's averment is not by way of affidavit; (2) his supporting documentation (Exhibit "E") consists of eight pages of printed out data identified as an IMF Tax Module and completely indecipherable to me; and (3) the significance of transaction code 914 is an unknown. Thomas has not met the burden of producing any significant facts that would raise a substantial question in my mind about the validity of agent Sousa's stated purpose. I would recommend that the court grant the IRS's motion for partial enforcement. I would further recommend that to the extent the IRS requests that the order granting partial enforcement be reduced to a particular form, it should be required to submit a proposed order or orders within ten days of the entry of an order affirming this recommended decision, if such an affirmation issues.

III. The Jacy Richardson Summons
On November 18, 2002, Special Agent Debra Sousa served an IRS summons on Jacy Richardson seeking records relating to Three Crows Corporation. Neither Three Crows Corporation nor Jacy Richardson have ever entered an appearance in this court. Richard Thomas filed a motion to quash the subpoena served on Jacy Richardson, using the same format and raising the same arguments as in his earlier motions to quash. (Docket No. 16). The United States responded by filing a motion to dismiss asserting that Thomas lacked standing to bring such a motion. (Docket No. 17.) The United States' argument was grounded on the notion that Jacy Richardson is not a third-party record keeper within the statutory definition and therefore Thomas lacked standing to bring a motion to quash and the court lacks jurisdiction to quash the summons.
Pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 7603(b)(2)(A)-(J) there are ten categories of entities that are identified as "third-party recordkeepers." These entities include banks and credit unions, attorneys, accountants, securities brokers, and developers of computer software source code, among others. The predominant characteristic *182 of these third-party record keepers is that they all keep records involving transactions between the taxpayer and parties other than the third-party recordkeeper. Upton v. IRS, 104 F.3d 543, 546-47 (2nd Cir.1997). Other entities that may have information pertaining to a taxpayer, such as employers or academic institutions, do not fall within any of the statutorily enumerated categories. The significance of being a third-party recordkeeper is that a taxpayer is only entitled to notice and given the right to intervene and prevent disclosure under § 7609 when records are sought from a third-party recordkeeper. There is no right to sue the United States in the absence of a waiver of its sovereign immunity and the statute waiving that immunity has no applicability if the summons was not issued to a third-party recordkeeper. Gilmartin v. IRS, 174 F.Supp.2d 117,119 (S.D.N.Y.2001).
Mercifully the United States does not move for the enforcement of this summons. The unfortunate corollary is that there is no affidavit or other indication in the file to assist me in determining who Jacy Richardson is and what she has to do with this case. I can make an educated guess that she might be a clerk of the Three Crows Corporation based upon the fact that the summons requests corporate records. I also know that she is a notary because she acknowledged Thomas's signature on his pleadings. However, those facts do not confer standing on Thomas to proceed under § 7609 nor do they give this court jurisdiction to proceed pursuant to § 7609 and Thomas invokes this court's jurisdiction pursuant to that provision. (Docket No. 16 at 2).
Based upon these circumstances I recommend that the court grant the United States' motion to dismiss.

Conclusion
In summary I recommend that the court dispose of the eight pending motions as follows:
Petitioner's Motions to Quash, Docket Nos. 3, 4, and 8 are DENIED.
Petitioner's Motions to Quash, Docket No. 16 and so much of Docket No. 4 as relates to First Citizens Bank and United Kingfield Bank are DISMISSED based upon lack of jurisdiction.
The United States' Motion to Dismiss (Docket No. 5) is DISMISSED as moot.
The United States' Motion to Dismiss (Docket No. 17) relating to Jacy Richardson is GRANTED.
The United States' Motions for Partial Enforcement (as to all entities except Trent Jones and the Ichabod Trust) are GRANTED (Docket Nos. 12 and 14). If the United States requests that the order[s] granting partial enforcement be reduce to a specific form, they should be required to file a proposed order within ten days of the court's decision on this matter.[4]

NOTICE
A party may file objections to those specified portions of a magistrate judge's report or proposed findings or recommended decisions entered pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B) for which de novo review by the district court is sought, together with a supporting memorandum, within ten (10) days of being *183 served with a copy thereof. A responsive memorandum shall be filed within ten (10) days after the filing of the objection.
Failure to file a timely objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to de novo review by the district court and to appeal the district court's order.
February 14, 2003.
NOTES
[1]  In addition to these motions, the United States also filed an earlier Motion to Dismiss (Docket No. 5). That motion, unaccompanied by any memorandum of law, relates to an earlier motion to quash filed by Thomas. (Docket No. 1.) The issues raised by those pleadings were resolved by the Court by order dated November 15, 2002. (Docket No. 11.) Therefore Docket No. 5 is DISMISSED as moot.
[2]  In this portion of the recommended decision I address only the first three of the motions to quash. The fourth motion to quash relates to the Jacy Richardson summons and it is addressed separately in Part III of this decision.
[3]  The United States is not, at this time, seeking enforcement of the summonses as they relate to Trent R. Jones or the Ichabod Trust because Jones did not receive notice of the summons.
[4]  I include this proviso because in some of the cases granting enforcement the court has directed the government to submit a proposed order. See, e.g., United States v. Streett, 791 F.Supp. 563 (D.Md.1992). It is unclear to me why the District Court's memorandum of decision and order would not be sufficient to accomplish the necessary enforcement of the summons, but to the extent an additional and supplemental order is required, the government should submit its proposal with the necessary explanation.

        UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of these petitions for review of

Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) decisions, it is hereby

ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED, that the petitions for review

are DENIED.

        Each of these petitions challenges a decision of the BIA

either affirming the decision of an immigration judge (“IJ”)

denying asylum and related relief or reversing the IJ’s

decision granting relief.           Some of the petitioners2 also

challenge decisions of the BIA denying motions to remand or

reopen.         The   applicable   standards   of   review   are   well-

established. See Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, 546 F.3d 138, 157-

58, 168-69 (2d Cir. 2008).

        Petitioners, all natives and citizens of China, sought

relief from removal based on their claims that they fear

persecution because they have had one or more children in

violation of China’s population control program.      For largely

the same reasons as this Court set forth in Jian Hui Shao, 546

F.3d 138, we find no error in the agency’s decisions.      See id.

at 158-72.      While the petitioners in Jian Hui Shao were from

Fujian Province, as are most of the petitioners here, some

petitioners3 are from Zhejiang Province.     Regardless, as with

the evidence discussed in Jian Hui Shao, the evidence they

have submitted relating to Zhejiang Province is deficient

either because it does not discuss forced sterilizations or

because it references isolated incidents of persecution of

individuals who are not similarly situated to the petitioners.

See id. at 160-61, 171-72.

        Some of the petitioners4 argue that the BIA erred by

improperly conducting de novo review of determinations made by

an IJ.          Many of them rely on a decision of the Third Circuit,

ruling, in the context of a claim under the Convention Against

Torture (“CAT”), that, although the BIA may review de novo

conclusions of law as to whether the facts found satisfy a

particular legal standard, it must employ a clear error

standard in reviewing findings of fact, including predictions

of future events.          See Kaplun v. Attorney General, 602 F.3d

260 (3d Cir. 2010).         Their claims lack merit.   The BIA has not

reviewed de novo any of the IJs’ factual findings.           Instead,

the BIA has concluded, on de novo review, that the factual

findings do not meet the legal standard of an objectively

reasonable fear of persecution, in these cases, a fear of

forced sterilization or economic persecution.           That approach

is entirely consistent with the applicable regulation, 8

C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).          See Jian Hui Shao, 546 F.3d at 162-63

(concluding that the BIA did not erroneously conduct de novo

review          of   the   IJ’s   factual   findings    by   making   “a   legal

determination that, while [petitioners’] credible testimony

was sufficient to demonstrate a genuine subjective fear of

future          persecution,      more   was   needed   to   demonstrate    the

objective reasonableness of that fear”).

        Some of the petitioners5 argue that the BIA failed to give

sufficient consideration to the statement of Jin Fu Chen, who

alleged that he suffered forced sterilization after his return

to China based on the births of his two children in Japan.                     A

prior panel of this Court has remanded a petition making a

similar claim so that Jin Fu Chen’s statement (which was

submitted to the BIA after a remand) could be considered by

the IJ.         See Zheng v. Holder, No. 07-3970-ag (2d Cir. Jan. 15,

2010).          Since the remand in Zheng, the BIA has repeatedly

concluded that Jin Fu Chen’s statement does not support a

claim of a well-founded fear of persecution.                  Accordingly, it

is clear that further consideration of the statement in cases

in which the IJ or the BIA failed to consider it would not

change the result.              See Shunfu Li v. Mukasey, 529 F.3d 141,

150 (2d Cir. 2008).               Furthermore, the agency’s conclusion

concerning the probative force of the statement was not in

error.          Similarly, contrary to the argument raised in five of

these        cases,6    it   would   be    futile     to    remand    for   further

consideration of the statements of Mei Yun Chen and Jiangzhen

Chen, women claiming to have been forcibly sterilized in

Fujian Province for violating the family planning policy with

the birth of their second children in Romania and Japan

respectively,          because     the    BIA   has      reasonably    found     that

neither woman is similarly situated to Chinese nationals

returning to China with U.S. citizen children.                        See id.; see

also Jian Hui Shao, 546 F.3d at 155, 161, 171-72.

        We      are   without    jurisdiction       to     consider   two   of    the

petitions7 to the extent they seek review of the agency’s

pretermission          of    petitioners’       applications     for    asylum     as

untimely.          See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3).

        In Xiu Qin Huang v. Holder, No. 08-5530-ag, the agency

reasonably relied on 2006 and 2007 U.S. Department of State

reports as opposed to the outdated 1997 Tantou Town Family

Planning Temporary Regulations petitioner submitted. See Jian

Hui Shao, 546 F.3d at 166.           Moreover, it does not appear that

the Tantou Town Regulations were material to petitioner’s case

because the record evidence indicated that she resided and

feared          persecution   in   Hunan   Town   and   not   Tantou   Town.

Although petitioner refers to Tantou Town as her “hometown” in

her brief, unsworn statements in a brief are not evidence.

See Kulhawik v. Holder, 596 F.3d 296, 298 (2d Cir. 2009).

        In Zhong Lin Jiang v. Holder, No. 10-460-ag, the BIA did

not err in declining to address the evidence petitioner

submitted for the first time on appeal.                   See 8 C.F.R. §

1003.1(d)(3)(iv); see also Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I. & N.

Dec. 57, 74 (BIA 1984).             Regardless, the evidence submitted

was largely cumulative of the evidence in the record and not

materially distinguishable from the evidence discussed in Jian

Hui Shao.            In Qin Lin v. Holder, No. 10-923-ag, the BIA

similarly did not err when it denied petitioner’s motion to

remand based on her failure to establish her prima facie

eligibility for relief.             See Li Yong Cao v. U.S. Dep’t of


09262011-1-28                         -9-
Justice, 421 F.3d 149, 156 (2d Cir. 2005); see also Jian Hui

Shao, 546 F.3d at 165, 172.

        In      Ying   Wang   v.   Holder,      No.   10-947-ag,    the   agency

reasonably found speculative the petitioner’s claimed fear

that she would face persecution based on her intent to join an

unregistered church in China. See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, 421

F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir. 2005); see also Hongsheng Leng v.

Mukasey, 528 F.3d 135, 143 (2d Cir. 2008).                   In Mei Ru Lin v.

Holder,         No.    10-1268-ag,    we   do   not    consider    petitioner’s

unexhausted past persecution claim.                   See Foster v. INS, 376

F.3d 75, 78 (2d Cir. 2004).                In Zhu Chao Wang v. Holder, No.

10-1293-ag, the IJ did not abuse his discretion by declining

to     admit      petitioner’s       late-filed       evidence    because   that

evidence pre-dated the hearing at which he closed the record.

See Dedji v. Mukasey, 525 F.3d 187, 191 (2d Cir. 2008).                     In Yu

Ping Bao v. Holder, Nos. 1902-ag (L), 11-843-ag (Con), the BIA

did not err in finding that the petitioner failed to establish

her prima facie eligibility for relief based on her newly

commenced practice of Falun Gong in the United States because

she did not submit evidence that authorities in China are

aware of or likely to become aware of her activities in the

United States.            See Hongsheng Leng, 528 F.3d at 143.


09262011-1-28                           -10-
        Finally, in Jiandan Wu, Zhixiang Cheng v. Holder, No. 10-

2797-ag, petitioners assert the BIA, in ruling that they

failed          to   satisfy   the   exceptional    and   extremely   unusual

hardship requirement, erroneously minimized the impact their

removal would have on their U.S. citizen children.                        The

contention is both ineffective and moot.                  It is ineffective

because the challenged decision was discretionary and did not

involve a question of law or constitutional claim; our court

is therefore without jurisdiction to review it. See Mendez v.

Holder, 566 F.3d 316, 319-23 (2d Cir. 2009) (citing 8 U.S.C.

§ 1252(a)(2)(B); Barco-Sandoval v. Gonzales, 51                   6 F.3d 35,

39 (2d Cir. 2008). The contention is in addition moot because

the agency also dispositively denied cancellation of removal,

which decision petitioners have not challenged (and which we,

in any event, would lack jurisdiction to review because it was

a discretionary decision not involving a question of law or

constitutional claim. See id.).

        For the foregoing reasons, these petitions for review are

DENIED.          As we have completed our review, any stay of removal

that the Court previously granted in these petitions is

VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in these

petitions is DISMISSED as moot.                Any pending request for oral

Before WIDENER and WILKINSON, Circuit Judges, and HAMILTON, Senior
Circuit Judge.


Affirmed by unpublished per curiam opinion.


David W. Plowden, Assistant Federal Public Defender, Greenville,
South Carolina, for Appellant. Elizabeth Jean Howard, OFFICE OF THE
UNITED STATES ATTORNEY, Greenville, South Carolina, for Appellee.


Unpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.
PER CURIAM:

             Joseph Douglas Webb, Jr., pled guilty to being a felon in

possession of a firearm.       He was sentenced to thirty-seven months

in prison.    On appeal, Webb’s attorney has filed an Anders* brief,

stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but

questioning whether Webb’s sentence was reasonable.          Although Webb

was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, he

has not done so.

             Before determining a sentence, the district court is

required to calculate and consider the appropriate guideline range,

as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) (2000).

United States v. Hughes, 401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir. 2005).              We

will affirm a sentence if it is both reasonable and within the

statutorily prescribed range.      Id. at 546-47.       Here, the district

court calculated a guideline range of 37-46 months, to which Webb

had no objection.      The court then heard from counsel, Webb, and

Webb’s   fiancee   regarding    Webb’s   success   in   school,   his   work

history, his drug problems, and his family responsibilities. After

stating that it had considered the guideline range and the relevant

statutory sentencing factors, the district court imposed a sentence

well below the statutory maximum and at the bottom of the guideline

range.   We find that the sentence was reasonable.

                                   - 2 -
           In accordance with Anders, we have reviewed the entire

record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for

appeal.   We therefore affirm Webb’s conviction and sentence.             This

court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his

right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for

further review.    If the client requests that a petition be filed,

but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then

counsel   may   move   in   this   court    for   leave   to   withdraw   from

representation.    Counsel’s motion must state that a copy thereof

was served on the client.

           We dispense with oral argument because the facts and

legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before

the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.

Before QUINN, C.J., and CAMPBELL and PIRTLE, JJ.


                              MEMORANDUM OPINION
                                       
Appellant, Bill, appeals from the trial court's order terminating his parental rights to his child, S.J.P.P.  He presents two issues.  We will overrule his issues and affirm the judgment of the trial court.
                                  Background
Bill and Daniele were married and had a son, S.J.P.P, born in May 2003.  The parties divorced in January 2005. At that time, Bill was named possessory conservator, was not ordered to pay child support, and had visitation at any time mutually agreed by the parties.  At the time of the divorce, both parties were incarcerated for forgery of the same check.  Daniele was sentenced to one year and Bill to 15 years.
On April 13, 2010, Daniele filed a petition to terminate Bill's parental rights and to change the child's name.  In that petition, Daniele alleged Bill's parental rights should be terminated under subsections (F), (H) and (Q) of Family Code § 161.001(1).  Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 161.001(1)(F), (H), (Q) (West 2009).  A hearing was held on the petition on October 5, 2010.  Bill's request for a bench warrant to attend the hearing was denied but he participated via telephone.
At the hearing, the court heard testimony that Daniele took S.J.P.P. to see Bill while he was in prison but the visits ended when the child was five months old.  Since then, Bill has continually written to his son, making effort to stay in contact with him.  He also took several educational and behavior modification classes while incarcerated, including a gang renouncement class, parenting classes, anger management classes, and four substance abuse classes. He also became a certified painter, estimator and appraiser and worked toward an associate's degree in business administration.  He has a job prospect when he is released that will earn him $3000 per month.   In April 2010, he was required to, and did take, a "Changes One" class.  This class is a prerequisite for being released on parole and, according to Bill, may be taken only when release is expected within two years.
The court concluded the hearing without ruling and later issued a letter ruling, followed by an order, terminating Bill's parental rights under § 161.001(1)(Q).  It is from that order Bill now appeals.
                                   Analysis
By his two issues on appeal, Bill argues the evidence presented at the hearing was legally and factually insufficient to support termination of his parental rights under Family Code § 161.001(1)(Q) because he presented evidence showing he would be paroled before the expiration of that subsection's two-year period and showing he would be able to care for S.J.P.P. during his incarceration.
The natural right that exists between parents and their children is one of constitutional dimension. In re J.W.T., 872 S.W.2d 189, 194-95 (Tex. 1994). A parent's right to "the companionship, care, custody and management" of his children is a constitutional interest "far more precious than any property right." Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 758-59, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 1397, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982) (quoting Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 1212, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 (1972)). Therefore, in a case terminating parental rights, the proceedings are strictly scrutinized, and the involuntary termination statutes are strictly construed in favor of the parent. Holick v. Smith, 685 S.W.2d 18, 20 (Tex. 1985).
Termination of parental rights is a drastic remedy and is of such weight and gravity that due process requires the petitioner to justify termination by "clear and convincing evidence." Spangler v. Texas Dept. of Prot. & Reg. Servs., 962 S.W.2d 253, 256 (Tex. App.-- Waco 1998, no pet.). This standard is defined as "that measure or degree of proof which will produce in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established." Id.; Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 161.001 et. seq (West 2010).  In a proceeding to terminate the parent-child relationship brought under section 161.001 of the Texas Family Code, the movant must establish by clear and convincing evidence two elements: (1) one or more acts or omissions enumerated under subsection (1) of section 161.001 and (2) that termination is in the best interest of the child. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 161.001 (West 2010); Swate v. Swate, 72 S.W.3d 763, 766 (Tex.App.-- Waco 2002, pet. denied). The factfinder must find that both elements are established by clear and convincing evidence, and proof of one element does not relieve the petitioner of the burden of proving the other. Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367, 370 (Tex. 1976); Swate, 72 S.W.3d at 766.
	In a legal sufficiency review, a court should look at all the evidence in the light most favorable to the finding to determine whether a reasonable trier of fact could have formed a firm belief or conviction that its finding was true. In re J.F.C., 96 S.W.3d 256, 266 (Tex. 2002). In this context, looking at the evidence in the light most favorable to the judgment means that a reviewing court must assume that the factfinder resolved disputed facts in favor of its finding if a reasonable factfinder could do so.  Id. A corollary to this requirement is that a court should disregard all evidence that a reasonable factfinder could have disbelieved or found to have been incredible.  Id.
	In determining a factual-sufficiency point, the higher burden of proof in termination cases also alters the appellate standard of review. In re C.H., 89 S.W.3d 17, 26 (Tex. 2002). "[A] finding that must be based on clear and convincing evidence cannot be viewed on appeal the same as one that may be sustained on a mere preponderance." Id. at 25. In considering whether evidence rises to the level of being clear and convincing, we must consider whether the evidence is sufficient to reasonably form in the mind of the factfinder a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegation sought to be established. Id. We consider whether disputed evidence is such that a reasonable factfinder could not have resolved that disputed evidence in favor of its finding. J.F.C., 96 S.W.3d at 266. "If, in light of the entire record, the disputed evidence that a reasonable factfinder could not have credited in favor of the finding is so significant that a factfinder could not reasonably have formed a firm belief or conviction, then the evidence is factually insufficient." Id.
Subsection 161.001(1)(Q) allows termination of parental rights when a parent knowingly has engaged in criminal conduct, resulting in the parent's conviction of an offense, and the parent is both incarcerated and unable to care for the child for at least two years from the date the termination petition was filed. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 161.001(1)(Q) (West 2010). Incarceration and a parent's inability to provide care are separate requirements for termination of parental rights under subsection 161.001(1)(Q)(ii). In re E.S.S., 131 S.W.3d 632, 639 (Tex. App.-- Fort Worth 2004, no pet.); In re B.M.R., 84 S.W.3d 814, 818 (Tex. App.-- Houston [1st Dist.] 2002, no pet.). Subsection Q's two-year time period applies prospectively.  In re A.V., 113 S.W.3d 355, 360 (Tex. 2003).
That Bill knowingly engaged in criminal conduct and was convicted and incarcerated is not disputed.  Bill's challenge focuses on the evidence his incarceration will continue for at least two years from the date the termination petition was filed, that is, until April 13, 2012, and that he will be unable to care for his son during that time. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 161.001(1)(Q).    
Bill testified he would be considered for parole in July 2011.  He also acknowledged he was denied parole in July 2010 and his long-term projected release date is March 5, 2018.  A letter from the Texas Department of Corrections was admitted into evidence, confirming this information.  As noted, Bill testified he participated in a pre-release class in which only inmates expected to be released within two years may participate.  He attributed his denial of parole in July 2010 to the fact he then had not yet completed the pre-release class.
	Evidence of the availability of parole is relevant to determine whether the parent will be released within two years of the date the termination petition was filed.  In re H.R.M., 209 S.W.3d 105, 108 (Tex. 2006) (per curiam).  However, mere introduction of parole-related evidence does not prevent a fact-finder from forming a firm conviction or belief that the parent will remain incarcerated for at least two years. Id. Parole decisions are inherently speculative, and while all inmates doubtless hope for early release and can take positive steps to improve their odds, the decision rests entirely with the parole board. Id.  Evidence of participation in a pre-release program available to inmates within two years of parole does not preclude a finding the parent will remain incarcerated.  Id. 
While the evidence illustrated the possibility of Bill's release prior to April 13, 2012, as the court determined on a similar record in H.R.M., such evidence did not prevent the trial court from forming a firm belief or conviction he would remain incarcerated after that date. H.R.M., 209 S.W.3d at 109.  The trial court was free to credit and give greater weight to the facts Bill was serving a 15-year sentence, had once been denied parole, and had a projected release date of March 5, 2018.  Id.  Viewing the evidence under the proper standards, we find the evidence before the trial court was sufficient to permit the court to form a firm conviction or belief Bill would remain incarcerated until at least April 13, 2012.
We find the evidence similarly sufficient that Bill would be unable to care for his son during his incarceration.  We note initially that the requirement of showing an inability to care for a child is not met by evidence of incarceration alone.  In re Caballero, 53 S.W.3d 391, 396 (Tex.App. -- Amarillo 2001, pet. denied) (addressing term "care" in subsection (Q)).  At the same time, evidence that the child resides with his mother does not preclude a finding Bill is unable to provide for him.  See H.R.M., 209 S.W.3d at 110 (absent evidence non-incarcerated parent agreed to care for child on behalf of incarcerated parent, merely leaving child with non-incarcerated parent does not constitute ability to provide care).  Courts have determined that the factors to be considered when deciding whether an incarcerated parent is unable to care for a child include the availability of financial and emotional support.  See, e.g., In re B.M.R., 84 S.W.3d 814, 818 (Tex.App. -- Houston [1[st] Dist.] 2002, no pet.). Holding that subsection Q applies prospectively rather than retroactively, the court in A.V., described its aim as ensuring "that the child will not be neglected," because a parent "will be unable to provide for" the child during incarceration.  A.V., 113 S.W.3d at 360.  Daniele testified Bill never provided support to S.J.P.P.  She testified she alone supported their son and Bill was not ordered to pay child support.  Bill acknowledges that until he is released, he has neither the means to provide financial support to his son nor anyone willing to care for S.J.P.P. in his stead.  
Bill has not seen his child since S.J.P.P. was five months old.  Bill argues on appeal, however, that he stayed in contact with S.J.P.P. by writing letters to him and thus provided him emotional support.  He highlights his effort to maintain contact, including filing a motion for enforcement at one point, seeking to obtain a mailing address for his son.  While Bill is correct that emotional support is an important element of care for a child, the concept of "care" in subsection Q clearly involves more than emotional support.  Caballero, 53 S.W.3d at 396.  The evidence to which Bill points speaks not at all, for example, to how S.J.P.P. will be fed, clothed, sheltered, or educated until Bill is released, or how the boy will be ensured the presence of nurturing adults.  See In re E.S.S., 131 S.W.3d at 640 (incarcerated parent proposed mother and brother as possessory conservators with visitation rights).    
	We overrule Bill's challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence termination was warranted under Family Code § 161.001(1)(Q).  As noted, Bill does not challenge the court's finding that termination was in his son's best interest.  Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.

159 Cal. Rptr. 762
CITY OF LOS ANGELES et al., Plaintiffs and Respondents,
v.
AL SILVER et al., Defendants and Appellants.
Docket No. 56317.
Court of Appeals of California, Second District, Division Two.
November 14, 1979.
*747 COUNSEL
Jonathan K. Golden for Defendants and Appellants.
Burt Pines, City Attorney, William B. Burge, Assistant City Attorney, and Claudia McGee Henry, Deputy City Attorney, for Plaintiffs and Respondents.
OPINION
ROTH, P.J.
In July of 1977, appellant began operation of an amusement center known as "Rock City" located at 7001 Hollywood Boulevard in the City of Los Angeles, part of an area designated for zoning purposes as "C4." At its inception, the center's business inventory consisted of some 28 coin-operated game machines of the pinball or *748 electronic variety. Within days of its opening, the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety issued its order to discontinue the venture's operation because it was in contravention of Los Angeles Municipal Code (L.A.M.C.) section 12.16.[1] When the order was not complied with, a criminal complaint was filed against appellants on September 14, 1977, for violation of the section, and on May 25, 1978, they were found guilty of the charge. By this time more than 60 machines of the type described had been installed and that number increased to some 118 operating on a 24-hour day, 7 days a week, basis by July 13 the same year, when respondent city filed its complaint below for an injunction against continued code violation.[2] On September 12, 1978, a preliminary injunction was issued by the trial court which provided: "IT IS ORDERED that during the pendency of this action or until further order of the Court, defendants Al Silver and Kathryn Silver, their agents, officers, employees, and representatives, and all persons acting in concert with or participating with them are hereby enjoined from engaging in, or performing any and all of the following: a) Maintaining the amusement enterprise known as "Rock City," located at 7001-03 Hollywood Boulevard (hereafter called premises) in the City of Los Angeles, in violation of any provisions of law. b) Using the premises for the maintenance and operation of a penny arcade, to wit an amusement center where coin operated devices for entertainment are made available to members of the public; c) Using the premises for the maintenance and operation of games of skill and science including any games where consideration is paid by a player for the right to play or participate in a game; pinball machines; football game machines; electronic games; and any other coin operated amusement games; and d) Using the premises in violation of the provisions of Section 12.16 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code."
*749 After the injunction likewise was ignored, appellant Al Silver was adjudged guilty of contempt at a hearing held for that purpose on November 7, 8 and 9, 1978, and he was sentenced to 45 days in jail, with the proviso that if after serving 5 days he agreed to cause cessation of the activity described in the injunction the remainder of the sentence would be suspended. When that agreement failed to be entered upon and the business continued as before, the trial court on December 22 the same year, following notice and hearing, issued its order restating the provisions of the preliminary injunction and further directing the Los Angeles Police Department to remove "all coin operated devices for entertainment which are made available on the [business] premises to members of the public." That directive was executed and the items referred to were seized.
Both the order granting the initial preliminary injunction and that which revised it in the fashion described are the subjects of this appeal.
For the purposes of our disposition herein, the issues are:
1. Whether the coin-operated game machines at Rock City are games of "skill and science" within the meaning of L.A.M.C. section 12.16.
2. Whether Rock City is a "penny arcade" under the same section.
3. Whether the order directing removal of the machines was properly granted.
(1), (2) Respondents advance pertinent legal propositions reiterated by Lockard v. City of Los Angeles (1949) 33 Cal.2d 453, 460, [202 P.2d 38, 7 A.L.R.2d 990], which are not controverted by appellants, namely, that: "It is well settled that a municipality may divide land into districts and prescribe regulations governing the uses permitted therein, and that zoning ordinances, when reasonable in object and not arbitrary in operation, constitute a justifiable exercise of police power. (Wilkins v. City of San Bernardino, 29 Cal.2d 332, 337 [175 P.2d 542]; Acker v. Baldwin, 18 Cal.2d 341, 344 [115 P.2d 455]; see Skalko v. City of Sunnyvale, 14 Cal.2d 213, 215 [93 P.2d 93].) In enacting zoning ordinances, the municipality performs a legislative function, and every intendment is in favor of the validity of such ordinances. (Jardine v. City of Pasadena, 199 Cal. 64, 72-73 [248 P. 225, 48 A.L.R. 509].) It is presumed that the enactment as a whole is justified under the police power and adapted to promote the public health, safety, morals, and *750 general welfare. (See Wilkins v. City of San Bernardino, 29 Cal.2d 332, 338 [175 P.2d 542].)"
(3) It is likewise pointed out that municipal regulation through zoning specifying permissible locations of entertainment and amusement enterprises has long been recognized judicially. (Sunset Amusement Co. v. Board of Police Commissioners (1972) 7 Cal.3d 64 [101 Cal. Rptr. 768, 496 P.2d 840], app. dism. (1973) 409 U.S. 1121 [35 L.Ed.2d 254, 93 S.Ct. 940] [skating rinks]; Carolina Lanes, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1967) 253 Cal. App.2d 831 [61 Cal. Rptr. 630] [strip tease]; Francis v. County of Stanislaus (1967) 249 Cal. App.2d 862 [57 Cal. Rptr. 881] [commercial card rooms]; In re Lawrence (1942) 55 Cal. App.2d 491 [131 P.2d 27] [pinball machines].)
(4) Finally, it is noted it is within a legitimate province of a city to legislatively declare violation of its zoning ordinances to be a public nuisance subject to abatement by injunction (see City and County of San Francisco v. Padilla (1972) 23 Cal. App.3d 388 [100 Cal. Rptr. 223]) and that the City of Los Angeles has done so. (L.A.M.C. § 11.00(m).)
Based upon the foregoing respondents maintain the trial court was justified in deciding the injunctions herein should issue. There is no doubt that contention is well taken, provided only that the Rock City enterprise is such as to fall within the excepted activities enumerated in L.A.M.C. section 12.16. (See fn. 1.)
Appellants urge that is not the case. They maintain, first, their coin-operated machines are not, under the city's own definition, "games of skill and science." Thus they point out L.A.M.C. section 103.116 defines such a game to be: "(a) Definitions. As used in this Article: 1. `GAME OF SKILL AND SCIENCE' means any game of amusement, but not including athletic sporting events, which is participated in by one or more players for any prize, gift or award of anything of value where or when any charge is made by the person conducting, operating or maintaining such game, or any consideration is paid by any player for the right to play or participate in any such game, and the dominating factor in determining the result of such game is dependent upon the skill of the player or players and not upon chance; provided, that in any case where the result of such game may be dependent to some extent upon the judgment, intelligence or adroitness of the player, but nevertheless the dominating factor in determining the result of such game is chance, *751 such a game shall not be considered as a game of skill and science, but shall be considered as a game of chance." (Italics added.)
Similarly, appellants maintain they were not operating a "penny arcade" as that term must be understood for the purpose, and that they may not constitutionally be found in violation of section 12.16 under its "other similar uses" phraseology.
(5a) In our view, whatever are the merits of appellants' arguments respecting the first and last of these contentions,[3] it cannot fairly be said the designation "penny arcade," though not otherwise defined, is such as to fail to embrace within its meaning those activities engaged in at Rock City or to be constitutionally offensive as either vague or ambiguous. (6) As in other instances where it has been necessary to test against a constitutional scale the import of language admittedly subject to dispute regarding definition, (see e.g., Rose v. Locke (1975) 423 U.S. 48 [46 L.Ed.2d 185, 96 S.Ct. 243]; County of Nevada v. MacMillen (1974) 11 Cal.3d 662 [114 Cal. Rptr. 345, 522 P.2d 1345]; In re J.T. (1974) 40 Cal. App.3d 633 [115 Cal. Rptr. 553]), what is required is only that interpretation proceed in accordance with what would commonly be understood by the language employed. (See People Younger v. Superior Court (1976) 16 Cal.3d 30 [127 Cal. Rptr. 122, 544 P.2d 1322].) (5b) Here the trial court concluded that by the term "penny arcade" as used in the ordinance in question what was meant was "an amusement center where coin operated devices for entertainment are made available to members of the public." That interpretation accords not only with ordinary understanding of the language but as well with the administrative construction of the term expressed in an opinion promulgated by the Los Angeles City Attorney in 1974.[4] We are persuaded the meaning arrived at was correctly determined.
*752 We are likewise of the view there was no error respecting the trial court's action in ordering seizure of the proscribed devices in order to enforce its otherwise valid directives in the face of what clearly amounted to a persistent, obstinate and unlawful refusal by appellants to abide by them. (7) "Every court has power to compel obedience to its judgments and orders (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 128, subd. 4, 177), and a court of equity retains inherent jurisdiction to oversee and enforce execution of its decrees. ([4] Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1970) Judgments, § 79, p. 3240; see, e.g., Lesser & Son v. Seymour. 35 Cal.2d 494, 500 ...; Green Trees Enterprises v. Palm Springs Alpine Estates, 66 Cal.2d 782, 788 ... Vallelunga v. Gomes, 102 Cal. App.2d 374, 382...." (8) (See fn. 5.) (Brown v. Brown (1971) 22 Cal. App.3d 82, 84 [99 Cal. Rptr. 311].)[5]
The orders appealed from are affirmed.
Compton, J., and Beach, J., concurred.
A petition for a rehearing was denied December 14, 1979, and appellants' petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied January 8, 1980.
NOTES
[1]  "SEC. 12.16. `C4' COMMERCIAL ZONE: The following regulations shall apply in the `C4' Commercial Zone:

"A. USE  No building, structure or land shall be used and no building or structure shall be erected, structurally altered, enlarged, or maintained, except for the following uses, and when a "Supplemental Use District" is created by the provisions of Article 3 of this Chapter, for such uses as may be permitted therein:
".... .... .... .... . .
"2. Any use permitted in the `C2' Zone except: (a) The following amusement enterprises: ... (1) boxing arena; (2) games of skill and science; (3) merry-go-round, ferris wheel or carousel; (4) penny arcade; (5) shooting gallery; (6) skating rink; (7) taxi dance hall; (8) strip tease show; (9) billiard or pool hall; (10) bowling alley; and other similar uses."
[2]  In the face of the Department of Building and Safety's order and of the criminal complaint, appellant entered into a renewal of his lease agreement covering the business premises for an additional four-year term at a total rental of $240,180, for the express purpose of conducting thereon "an arcade and for no other purpose."
[3]  We note in passing that the definition of "Game of Skill and Science" set out above is limited to the article in which it appears; that that article does not contain section 12.16; and that section 103.116 is concerned essentially with whether or not a police permit is required by the operator of the game. For a similar but less restrictive understanding of what constitutes a game of skill, see Cossack v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 726 at page 732 [114 Cal. Rptr. 460, 523 P.2d 260].
[4]  "Section 12.16A2(a)(4) of the Los Angeles Municipal Code does not permit a `penny arcade' enterprise in a C-4 commercial zone.

"While `penny arcade' is not defined for zoning purposes in the Municipal Code, Webster's Third New International Dictionary states that a `penny arcade' is an amusement center where each device for entertainment may be operated for a penny. The fact that a penny may not be used today to operate these devices has no effect on the basic definition. We would interpret a `penny arcade,' for zoning purposes, to mean a place of business devoted primarily or in some substantial degree to maintaining coin-operated amusement machines and devices for the purpose of providing public entertainment."
[5]  Appellants' further contention the trial court's order of police enforcement constituted a mandatory injunction which should have been stayed pending appeal is also without merit, since the directive was no more than in aid of the preliminary injunction and was not an order directing appellants to do anything. (See Kettenhofen v. Superior Court (1961) 55 Cal.2d 189 [10 Cal. Rptr. 356, 358 P.2d 684].)

J.H. GILLIS, P.J.
Defendant, Larry Douglas Rodgers, appeals his conviction by a jury of the offense of robbery armed.[1] The offense occurred on March 7, 1969, at approximately 8:40 p.m. in the City of Ecorse, Michigan.
The victim testified that while he was driving his automobile it was bumped from behind by another vehicle. The complainant observed that the car which struck him had no lights on and he immediately pulled to the curb. The other car pulled *215 parallel to complainant's car. Mr. Walker, the complainant, rolled down the window and noticed that the other car was occupied by five or six men. One man, sitting in the right front seat of the striking vehicle, said "We don't think there is much damage". Mr. Walker got out of his car to inspect the damage; he left his vehicle running and the lights on. Mr. Walker stated that one of the occupants of the striking automobile ran past him just as he reached the rear of his car to inspect the damage. This individual got into Mr. Walker's car, and when Mr. Walker rushed back this person leaped out with a gun in hand. The gun wielder pointed it at Mr. Walker saying, "I got a gun, I got a gun". The complainant testified that the remaining occupants of the striking vehicle got out of their car and began "working me over", and one of them took the complainant's wallet from his back right pocket. Mr. Walker identified the person with the gun as defendant, Larry Douglas Rodgers, and testified that the defendant pointed the gun at complainant's face and struck him with it. The assailants attempted to force Mr. Walker into his own automobile, but Mr. Walker ran from them at his first opportunity. After he traveled about 25 or 30 feet, he was shot in the back. The bullet struck about an inch from the spine at belt level. Mr. Walker ran to the nearest house where the occupants summoned police.
Patrolman Ohannasian of the Melvindale Police Department testified that on the morning of March 8, 1969, at approximately 12:45 a.m., he and his partner drove into a White Castle restaurant parking lot where he observed the complainant's automobile parked.[2] Officer Ohannasian testified that *216 the car was empty, and thus the officers drove out of the parking lot to a point nearby where continued surveillance could be made. The officer testified that he observed defendant and a young lady enter the car. At that moment the officers drove back into the lot and parked behind the automobile in question. Defendant was placed under arrest.
At trial, the victim identified defendant as the assailant who held the gun on him.
The defense was alibi. Defendant claimed he was at a high school basketball game at the time the robbery was committed. The defense produced several witnesses to substantiate this argument. One of those who testified on defendant's behalf was Samuel King. On direct examination Mr. King stated that he met the defendant at a basketball game and that they were together for the remainder of the evening. Later in the course of the trial, the prosecution recalled the investigating officer, Detective Taylor, who read, over defendant's objection, a statement he allegedly took from witness King at the time Taylor interviewed him:[3]
"The witness [Detective Taylor]: This is the statement of Samuel King taken by Detective Charles Taylor at 2249 South Electric, Detroit, Michigan. Time: 1:30 a.m. Saturday, June 14, 1969: `I went to the game that night. I saw Larry there but it wasn't until after the game. Anyway, the game was over I don't know what time it was but Larry did not go to the Castle with me. We were parked in the Castle parking lot. Larry might have come over sometime during the time he was at the Castle and got in my car and got right back out but he didn't go to the Castle with me. They told me *217 to say that he was with me but I told them I wasn't going to lie for them and I didn't want to get involved.'
"This is what he told me."
The court overruled the objection following the prosecutor's explanation that the evidence was being introduced solely for impeachment purposes. The statement was not read to prove the truth or falsity of witness King's prior testimony. Instead, it was read to contradict the prior testimony. The statement is not hearsay information as that term is evidentially understood.
"Testimony, the truth of which is not to disprove the crime but which if believed would tend to discredit the witnesses, cannot be classed as hearsay." Smith v. United States (CA6, 1960), 283 F2d 16, 20, cert den 365 US 847 (81 S Ct 808, 5 L Ed 2d 811).

Nor is the use of witness Taylor's memorandum statement an example of present memory improperly refreshed. For unlike present memory refreshed, the document referred to by the testifying witness was not set aside. People v. Thomas (1960), 359 Mich 251; People v. Redman (1969), 17 Mich App 610. Instead, this document was read into the record.
The memorandum now in question allegedly is Detective Taylor's verbatim transcription of his interview with witness King. Its contents, if actually stated by witness King and accurately recorded *218 by Detective Taylor, constitute a prior inconsistent out-of-court statement. To introduce such a prior inconsistent statement, the laying of a proper foundation is required. Osborne v. United States (CA9, 1967), 371 F2d 913, cert den 387 US 946 (87 S Ct 2082, 18 L Ed 2d 1335); People v. Keller (1933), 261 Mich 367. The foundation was laid when Mr. King, on cross-examination, was challenged with the information he allegedly gave Detective Taylor:
"Q. Do you know this man right here sitting in front of me?
"A. I don't know him.
"Q. You don't know him?
"A. No.
"Q. Do you know who he is?
"A. I know he is a detective.
"Q. Do you know what his name is?
"A. Taylor.
"Q. Taylor?
"A. Yeah.
"Q. All right. Is today the first day you ever saw him?
"A. No.
"Q. Did he come to see you over the weekend?
"A. Yes.
"Q. Did you talk to him over the weekend?
"A. Yes.
"Q. Did you tell him anything different than you told us here today?
"A. No.
"Q. Did you tell Detective Taylor, when he came to see you this weekend, that this man had never been in your car on that evening and wasn't riding with you that evening?
"A. No, I didn't.
"Q. And you hadn't been with him a whole year at that time?
"A. No.
*219 "Q. Did you tell the detective that?
"A. No.
"Q. You didn't?
"A. No.
"Q. You are sure about that, huh?
"A. Yes."
Witness King denied ever telling Detective Taylor anything which was inconsistent with his trial testimony. When the prosecution recalled Detective Taylor to refute this, he testified:
"Q. Did you take a written statement from Mr. King?
"A. I wrote it down and Mr. King was talking.
"Q. As Mr. King was talking to you, you wrote it down?
"A. Yes, exactly word for word what he said.
"Q. All right, I'm going to show you a piece of paper and ask you if you can identify that.
"A. Yes.
"Q. All right, can you tell me what it represents to you?
"A. That is a statement Mr. King given [sic] to me by him."
Detective Taylor also testified that Mr. King declined to sign this statement because he "did not want to get involved".
Detective Taylor's memorandum was introduced solely to impeach Mr. King's prior in-court testimony. It is generally held that a witness may be impeached by showing that his testimony upon a material matter is inconsistent with a prior statement made by him. 3A Wigmore on Evidence, §§ 1017-1022, pp 993-1018; McCormick on Evidence § 36, pp 66-67. A witness may be impeached by producing written statements which are inconsistent with the testimony given at the trial. 1 Underhill's *220 Criminal Evidence (5th ed), § 230, p 531. Michigan courts have traditionally allowed written statements made at the direction of the witness to be later used to impeach the witness's prior testimony. People v. Kennedy (1895), 105 Mich 434; People v. Tice (1897), 115 Mich 219; People v. Dellabonda (1933), 265 Mich 486; People v. DeBeaulieu (1944), 308 Mich 173. Witness King allegedly told witness Taylor what he knew. The memorandum, written in the hand of witness Taylor, represents the summary of that interview. Whether it is a verbatim transcription or the conclusions of witness Taylor is for the finder of fact to determine. However, in either instance it represents an alleged contradictory position to witness King's in-court testimony, and for the purposes of impeachment, was admissible. People v. Nemeth (1932), 258 Mich 682.
Furthermore, the trial court correctly instructed the jury that they could only consider this evidence for impeachment purposes. People v. Durkee (1963), 369 Mich 618. The court advised the jury that they could not consider the statement of King as recited by witness Taylor for the purpose of its truth nor could it be considered as substantive evidence. He further advised the jury that they could consider this testimony only for the purpose of testing the credibility of the witness.
We find no error in this regard. Other questions raised on appeal have been considered, and we find no reversible error.
Affirmed.
R.B. BURNS, J., concurred.
LEVIN, J. (dissenting).
I am in full agreement with my colleagues that the people were entitled to *221 impeach the credibility of a witness who testified in support of the defendant's alibi by showing that the witness told a different story to a detective than the one he related at the trial. Plainly, incontrovertibly, that is the law.
The real issue  not touched on in the majority opinion  concerns the manner in which the people were allowed to prove the prior inconsistent statement.
Over the objection of the defendant's lawyer, the trial judge allowed the detective to read a written statement he wrote out at the time of his conversation with the alibi witness; the witness had refused to sign the statement. The judge ruled that the detective could read the statement under the exception to the hearsay rule for past recollection recorded. In that ruling the judge erred on the facts of this case.
I.
The defendant was convicted of committing the offense of armed robbery. The defense was alibi.[1] The defendant claimed that he was at a high school basketball game at the time of the robbery. Sixteen of his friends, among them, Samuel King, supported various time sequences of his alibi.
*222 The trial commenced on a Thursday and ended the following Wednesday. On the intervening Saturday King was interviewed by a detective. King testified on Monday.
On direct examination, King said that he met the defendant at the game at halftime, was with him during the second half and left the game with him and other persons in King's automobile. The group made two stops and then proceeded to the drive-in restaurant where the defendant, a short time afterwards, was arrested.
During cross-examination, King denied having given the detective a different account. Specifically, King denied telling the detective that the defendant was not in King's automobile during the evening the crime was committed.
The people called the detective as a rebuttal witness. He testified that when he interviewed King on the intervening Saturday he wrote down what King said but King refused to sign the writing. The defendant's lawyer objected to the introduction or reading of the writing on the ground that it was hearsay.[2] The judge overruled the objection saying *223 that the detective's testimony was admissible as past recollection recorded. The detective then read the statement as follows:
"This is the statement of Samuel King taken by Detective Charles Taylor at 2249 South Electric, Detroit, Michigan. Time: 1:30 a.m. Saturday, June 14, 1969: `I went to the game that night. I saw Larry there but it wasn't until after the game. Anyway, the game was over I don't know what time it was but Larry did not go to the Castle with me. We were parked in the Castle parking lot. Larry might have come over sometime during the time he was at the Castle and got in my car and got right back out but he didn't go to the Castle with me. They told me to say that he was with me but I told them I wasn't going to lie for them and I didn't want to get involved.'
"This is what he told me."
II.
The majority ignore the judge's ruling that the statement was admissible under the exception for past recollection recorded and affirm his ruling admitting the statement on the ground that "the statement is not hearsay information as that term is evidentially understood."
We will, of course, ordinarily sustain on appeal a ruling by a judge who reaches the right result even though the grounds for decision stated by him are erroneous.[3] In this case the judge reached the wrong *224 result  the unsigned written memorandum was not shown to be admissible.
It is also true that a prior inconsistent statement of a witness, admissible to impeach his credibility, is not regarded as admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. It is admissible on the tenet that it is not hearsay because it is not offered as substantive evidence to prove the truth of the statement attributed to the witness but to prove that he said it. In theory at least the trier of fact is not being asked to accept the substance of the prior statement as the true account of the matter but rather to discount the witness's at-trial testimony because on an earlier occasion he gave a different account.
However, merely because the statement made by King to the detective when offered to impeach King's credibility is not hearsay, does not grant free license to introduce it by any means. Whether the earlier statement is, as here, oral or is written, the fact that it was made must be proved. If the earlier statement is written, the witness's handwriting or signature must be proved. If the earlier statement is oral the impeaching witness must be able to testify that the inconsistent statement was in fact made.
Just as an impeaching witness could not testify, in the name of impeachment, that Frank told him that Joe told Frank that Sara remarked to Bill that the chief defense witness had told her that the defendant had threatened the victim, so, too, an out-of-court written memorandum of an oral statement allegedly made by the witness to be impeached may be used to prove the fact that the statement was made only if that fact  the fact that the witness made the statement  is provable by means of such a memorandum.
*225 Although the inconsistent statement, when admissible to impeach credibility, is not hearsay, the written memorandum of the statement, unsigned by the witness being impeached, is hearsay and therefore admissible, if at all, only under an exception to the hearsay rule.[4]
A written memorandum of an oral statement made by another person, not signed by that person, necessarily reflects two statements; one written, the other oral: (1) it is the written statement of the writer of the memorandum that (2) the other person made the oral statement attributed to him.
Since the written memorandum, not signed by the other person, is an out-of-court statement made by the writer that the other person said what is contained in the writing, the writing itself is hearsay without regard to whether the statement recorded in it is offered as substantive evidence or solely to impeach credibility. The rules of evidence concerning the proof of facts do not evaporate upon utterance of the magic word "impeachment".[5]
*226 III.
A witness who does not have a present recollection of the facts may refer to a written memorandum. *227 If the memorandum refreshes his recollection, "when he speaks from a memory thus revived, his testimony is what he says, not the writing".[6] Accordingly, the general rule is that a party who uses a memorandum to refresh the memory of a witness may not introduce it in evidence or have it read to the jury.[7]
In this case the witness did not claim that his recollection was refreshed by reading the writing  he read the writing itself. This was not a case of testimony from refreshed recollection.
Nor, contrary to the ruling of the judge, did the prosecution make out a case for introduction of the writing as past recollection recorded. The exception for past recollection recorded may be availed of only in a case where it is claimed that the witness has no present recollection of the facts and, upon reference to the document, his memory is not refreshed.[8] When a witness testifies based on past recollection recorded it is the writing, not refreshed recollection, that is the evidence.
It is most difficult to cross-examine a witness who is allowed to "testify" based on past recollection *228 recorded. In allowing him to read the writing, the judge finds that he now has no present recollection of what was said when the writing was made and that his memory cannot be revived by reference to the writing; when cross-examined, such a witness is bound to retreat behind the writing.
The written word has a way of carrying greater weight than the spoken word. The law, therefore, wisely limits the use of past recollection recorded to those situations where the just mentioned preconditions to admissibility have been satisfied. Dispensing with the requirement that the witness not have "sufficient recollection to enable him to testify fully and accurately" would, as stated in the commentary accompanying the Revised Draft of Proposed Rules of Evidence for the United States District Courts and Magistrates, "encourage the use of statements carefully prepared for purposes of litigation under the supervision of attorneys, investigators or claim adjusters". (Emphasis supplied.)[9]
*229 The detective was not asked whether he had any present recollection of what King told him on Saturday  three days before he testified  or whether his recollection would be refreshed by reference to the writing. It is doubtful whether, if the detective had been so questioned, he would have claimed both that he had no recollection and that his recollection could not be refreshed from a writing he made just three days before he testified.
IV.
The admission of this inadmissible testimony could not properly be said to be harmless. There was a close question for resolution by the trier of fact. Although the defendant was seen, just a few hours after the robbery, entering the stolen automobile at the drive-in restaurant by police officers who had staked out the automobile, that did not establish that the defendant was one of the assailants. There were a number of assailants and what was done with the automobile between the time of the robbery and the time the defendant was apprehended was *230 not shown. The defendant's act of entering the automobile was at best circumstantial evidence, implicating him but not pointing assuredly to his guilt.
This left the identification testimony of the victim. His identification was not certain; he conceded that it was possible  although not probable  that he was mistaken. In this connection it is noteworthy that, although the defendant was in custody, the police showed a photograph to the victim the day he was released from the hospital.[10] The victim had not theretofore given the police a description of any of his assailants. He was not asked to view the defendant in a lineup. He did not view the defendant after he was arrested until the defendant was brought into the courtroom for the preliminary examination.
The resolution of the factual issue depended on the jury's evaluation of the victim's identification testimony and the contradictory testimony of the alibi witnesses. The detective's rebuttal testimony discrediting alibi witness King tended to discretit not only King's testimony but also the testimony of the other alibi witnesses who said they saw the defendant when he was with King.
The detective's rebuttal testimony was especially damaging to the defendant because of the statement attributed to King that "they told me to say that he was with me but I told them I wasn't going to lie for them and I didn't want to get involved". (Emphasis supplied.) It is doubtful whether the quoted words were admissible on any basis. They purport to be a statement by King as to what other *231 unidentified people  "them"  told him; triple hearsay: (1) the writing was hearsay, (2) the statement by King to the detective was hearsay (although when offered to impeach credibility it is not), and (3) the statement attributed to "them" was hearsay. It is well nigh impossible for a party to respond to a hearsay statement attributed to "them". "Them" are not identified; King denied making the statement  he, therefore, could not or would not identify "them". Who among "them" could the defendant call to answer the charge that "them" asked King to lie?
We could not properly declare that the detective's inadmissible testimony did not contribute to or affect the result.
NOTES
[1]  MCLA § 750.529 (Stat Ann 1971 Cum Supp § 28.797).
[2]  Identification of the automobile in question was made by observing its license plate. The plate number was traced to this vehicle.
[3]  The trial commenced on a Thursday and ended the following Wednesday. Witness King testified on Monday. On the intervening Saturday, he was interviewed by Detective Taylor.
[1]  The facts are set forth at some length in the majority opinion. In summary, the people's evidence was as follows: The victim testified that while he was driving his automobile it was bumped from behind by another automobile. After he had alighted to inspect the damage, one of the five or six occupants of the other automobile confronted him with a gun. The man with the gun and his companions struck the victim and took his wallet. The victim broke away and ran toward a nearby house and was shot in the back. He obtained aid and survived.

Four hours after the robbery the victim's automobile was sighted by police officers at a drive-in restaurant. They staked it out and a short time thereafter the defendant and a young lady entered the automobile. The defendant was arrested. At the trial, the victim identified the defendant as the occupant of the automobile who held the gun on him. See footnote 10 and accompanying text.
[2]  Hileman v. Indreica (1971), 385 Mich 1, 10, shows that our Supreme Court does not require absolute precision in voicing objections in order to preserve for review the propriety of a trial judge's ruling concerning the admissibility of evidence where the judge fails to see all the aspects of a multi-faceted problem of admissibility.

The defendants in that case contended successfully in our Court (see Hileman v. Indreica [1969], 15 Mich App 662, 664, 665) "that plaintiff did not state to the trial judge that she sought to use the deposition [of a witness] to refresh the recollection of the witness and to induce her to correct her testimony, but rather sought to have the trial judge declare the witness hostile in order to impeach her testimony" (emphasis supplied). The judge had ruled that the deposition could not be used because the witness was not hostile and plaintiff could not impeach her own witness.
On appeal the Supreme Court reversed and held that the deposition could be used to refresh the witnesses' recollection saying that the judge had erroneously "looked upon the effort of counsel [emphasis added] solely as an attempt to impeach [the witness], or as an effort to have her judged `hostile'". (Last emphasis added by the Court.)
Implicit in the judge's ruling that the statement was admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule is recognition on the judge's part that the writing itself was hearsay. See footnote 4 infra and accompanying text.
[3]  2 Michigan Law & Practice, Appeal, § 282.
[4]  See 3 Wigmore on Evidence, § 754a; McCormick on Evidence, §§ 276, 278.
[5]  I have found no authority holding that the fact that an inconsistent statement was made may be proved by the use of a memorandum of the statement not signed by the witness to be impeached without a showing that the person who made the memorandum cannot testify from present memory refreshed. See discussion in Part III of this opinion infra.

The question can arise whenever a stenographic transcript is offered to prove a prior inconsistent statement. Understandably in that kind of case, where it is obvious that the stenographer could not possibly recall the testimony or truly refresh his recollection by reading it and must testify based on past recollection recorded, no point is sometimes made about a failure to prove inability to testify from refreshed recollection. See St. Louis, S.F. & T.R. Co. v. Williams (Tex Civ App, 1937), 104 SW2d 103, 105; People v. Sherman (1950), 97 Cal App 2d 245 (217 P2d 715, 721).
Nevertheless in other cases the governing principle has been recognized, the courts stating that the stenographer could read a transcript of shorthand notes because he could not testify from refreshed or revised present recollection. See State v. Polan (1956), 80 Ariz 129 (293 F2d 931, 933); Hudlow v. Langerhans (1936), 230 Mo App 1160 (91 SW2d 629); Klepsch v. Donald (1894), 8 Wash 162 (35 P 621, 623). Similarly see Stahl v. City of Duluth (1898), 71 Minn 341 (74 NW 143, 146); Cooper v. Hoeglund (1946), 221 Minn 446 (22 NW2d 450, 455).
Cf. Robertson v. M/S Sanyo Maru (CA5, 1967), 374 F2d 463, holding that a purported copy of a statement signed by a witness and offered for impeachment purposes was improperly admitted since it had not been authenticated and the best evidence rule had not been complied with. See, also, Boulch v. John B. Gutmann Construction Company, Inc. (Mo App, 1963), 366 SW2d 21, 36.
In this case, the statement was not taken down by a stenographer. It does not purport to be a verbatim report of the questions and answers. It is a brief memorandum of a conversation. There is an obvious difference between a stenographic transcript prepared by a court reporter and a memorandum prepared by an investigator for one of the litigants.
The cases cited by the majority are distinguishable:
People v. Kennedy (1895), 105 Mich 434, 436, dealt not with out-of-court statements but with depositions made by a witness at a preliminary examination. The court held that the statements were "admissible as original evidence". It was sought to introduce the depositions through the testimony of the deputy clerk who recorded them at the preliminary examination. The court approved use of the written record only to refresh the memory of the witness.
In People v. Tice (1897), 115 Mich 219, no writing was involved and the testimony was solely from memory. No question of past recollection recorded was, therefore, presented.
In People v. Dellabonda (1933), 265 Mich 486, the earlier written statement sought to be introduced for impeachment purposes had been written by the witness being impeached. Again, no question of past recollection recorded was presented.
In People v. Nemeth (1932), 258 Mich 682, the prosecutor read to the jury statements made to the police by defense witnesses. The opinion does not indicate that the witnesses denied having made the statements or that the statements were not signed by the witnesses. Furthermore, there is no discussion of what foundation, if any, was laid for their admission.
Finally, People v. DeBeaulieu (1944), 308 Mich 173, 177, rather than supporting the position taken by the majority, held that a writing, signed by the witness sought to be impeached but prepared by another, was properly excluded where it appeared that the witness was unaware of what she had signed. The Court cited 6 Jones, Commentaries on Evidence (2d ed), § 2406, p 4746, for the proposition that "in order to serve as in itself a contradiction a writing must be shown to have been made by the witness himself, or by someone under his direction, or to have been approved and adopted by the witness as his own act and deed."
[6]  McCormick, Law of Evidence, § 9, p 15; 58 Am Jur, Witnesses, § 579.
[7]  29 Am Jur 2d, Evidence, § 876.
[8]  See People v. Hobson (1963), 369 Mich 189, 190-192; People v. Blakes (1966), 4 Mich App 13, 16; People v. Bracy (1967), 8 Mich App 266, 276; Jaxon v. City of Detroit (1967), 379 Mich 405, 413 (per T.E. BRENNAN, J.); 58 Am Jur, Witnesses, § 588.

Additional pre-conditions to admissibility are a showing that the document was prepared at some prior and rather remote date (People v. Hobson, supra), that the document is an original memorandum made by the witness from personal observation contemporaneously with or near the time of the transaction recorded (People v. Hobson, supra; Jaxon v. City of Detroit, supra) and that the substance recorded is not otherwise admissible (Jaxon v. City of Detroit, supra).
And, since in a case of past recollection recorded, in contrast with refreshed recollection, the writing, not revived recollection, is the evidence, most courts hold that the writing may be introduced in evidence in connection with the witness' testimony during his direct examination. See 29 Am Jur 2d, Evidence, § 877, p 978.
[9]  Text writers argue that the evidence should be admissible without regard to whether the witness remembers the event recorded (3 Wigmore on Evidence [Chadbourn Rev, 1970], § 738, p 91), but their views have not been accepted by most courts.

Indeed, the very argument advanced by these writers points up the danger of allowing use of past recollection memoranda indiscriminately. Just as they are of the opinion that the memoranda is likely to be more accurate than the witness' recollection, so, too, the trier of fact is likely to be under that impression. It is to guard against the indiscriminate creation, without any necessity, of "better" evidence that most courts have restricted the use of past recollection recorded writings.
The following appears in the commentary accompanying the Revised Draft of Proposed Rules of Evidence for the United States District Courts and Magistrates (March, 1971), Rule 803, p 111, exception 5 (51 FRD 315, 425):
"The principal controversy attending the exception has centered, not upon the propriety of the exception itself, but upon the question whether a preliminary requirement of impaired memory on the part of the witness should be imposed. The authorities are divided. If regard be had only to the accuracy of the evidence, admittedly impairment of the memory of the witness adds nothing to it and should not be required. McCormick § 277, p 593; 3 Wigmore § 738, p 76; Jordan v. People (1962), 151 Colo 133 (376 P2d 699), cert den 373 US 944 [83 S Ct 1553, 10 L Ed 2d 699]; Hall v. State (1960), 223 Md 158 (162 A2d 751); State v. Bindhammer (1965), 44 NJ 372 (209 A2d 124). Nevertheless, the absence of the requirement, it is believed, would encourage the use of statements carefully prepared for purposes of litigation under the supervision of attorneys, investigators, or claim adjusters. Hence the example includes a requirement that the witness not have `sufficient recollection to enable him to testify fully and accurately.' To the same effect are California Evidence Code § 1237 and New Jersey Rule 63(1) (b), and this has been the position of the federal courts. Vicksburg & Meridian R.R. v. O'Brien (1886), 119 US 99 [7 S Ct 118, 30 L Ed 299]; Ahern v. Webb (CA10, 1959), 268 F2d 45; and see N.L.R.B. v. Hudson Pulp & Paper Corp. (CA5, 1960), 273 F2d 660, 665; N.L.R.B. v. Federal Dairy Co. (CA1, 1962), 297 F2d 487. But cf. United States v. Adams (CA2, 1967), 385 F2d 548."
In all events, the Michigan Supreme Court appears to have aligned itself with the view that the writing is not admissible if the witness can independently recall the event or can refresh his recollection from the writing. See cases cited in fn 8.
[10]  See People v. Rowell (1968), 14 Mich App 190, 198 (LEVIN, J., concurring); People v. Adams (1969), 19 Mich App 131, 133, n 1; United States v. Zeiler (CA3, 1970), 427 F2d 1305, 1307; Commonwealth v. Whiting (1970), 439 Pa 205 (266 A2d 738).

STATE ex rel. JONES, Atty. Gen.
v.
LOCKHART.
No. 5857.
Supreme Court of Arizona.
December 26, 1953.
*391 Ross F. Jones, Atty. Gen., in pro. per.
A.M. Crawford and Thaddeus G. Baker, Asst. Attys. Gen., for plaintiff.
Ruffo Espinosa, Nogales, for defendant.
Parker & Muecke, and Robt. L. Myers, Phoenix, amici curiae.
UDALL, Justice.
The State of Arizona upon the relation of Ross F. Jones, Attorney General, brings this original action in quo warranto, asking that this court adjudge defendant Lynn Lockhart not entitled to hold or enjoy the office of state senator from Apache County, and that judgment of ouster be entered against him.
*393 The undisputed facts are that on March 30, 1953, there was filed with the secretary of state a regularly adopted Senate concurrent resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution of Arizona relating to the legislature, and directing that said amendment be submitted to the qualified electors at the next regular general election or at a special election called for that purpose. Thereafter, by the provisions of Chapter 123, Laws 1953, the legislature called a special election, to be held September 29, 1953, for the purpose of submitting the above and other proposed constitutional amendments to a vote of the people. The election was held, and when the official returns were canvassed it appeared the amendment in question had carried by a majority of 444 votes. Thereupon His Excellency, Governor Howard Pyle, in obedience to Article IV, Part 1, Section 1, subsection (13) of the Constitution, issued a proclamation declaring said amendment to be law.
The amendment is an amendment of Article IV, Part 2, Section 1, subsection (1) of our Constitution, Laws 1953, p. 360, and provides in part as follows:
"2. The Legislature
"(1) The Senate shall consist of two members from each county elected at large.
"Beginning with the Twenty-second Legislature the House of Representatives shall be composed of not to exceed eighty members, to be apportioned to the counties according to the number of ballots cast in each county at the preceding general election for governor in the manner herein provided. * * *"
(Then follows a complicated apportionment formula, presently based upon each 3520 ballots cast for Governor, which will freeze the House membership at the maximum above prescribed.)
At all times prior to the adoption of the foregoing amendment, the state senate had been composed of nineteen members, the apportionment by enumeration of counties being as follows: two senators each from Cochise, Gila, Maricopa, Pima, and Yavapai counties, and one senator from Apache County and each of the other eight counties of the state.
The governor evidently considered that with adoption of the amendment, in the nine counties having but one senator under the old provisions of the Constitution, there was a newly-created additional office of state senator, and that there was a vacancy in the term thereof. The parties to this case seem to agree, and we think properly so, that Chapter 37, Laws 1923, which appears in Article 11 of Chapter 55, A.C.A. 1939, providing for special election to fill vacancies in the legislature, has no application to the instant situation, wherein there has never been an incumbent of the *394 office. That law obviously provides only for the filling of vacancies caused by death, resignation or removal of a person who is already serving a term in the legislature. However, Article 5, Section 8, of our Constitution provides:
"When any office shall, from any cause, become vacant, and no mode shall be provided by the constitution or by law for filling such vacancy, the governor shall have the power to fill such vacancy by appointment."
Believing that this section did apply to the situation, that a term existed and there was a vacancy in the office, and that he was by law empowered to fill the same, the Governor on October 31, 1953, undertook to appoint defendant Lynn Lockhart, of Springerville, Arizona, as state senator from Apache County for a short term, effective November 2, 1953.
On that day defendant appeared at the office of the Governor and took his oath of office as state senator, and in compliance with the rules of the Senate subscribed to a non-communist oath. On the following day while the Senate was assembled in open session, defendant intruded upon that body and made demand upon the Senate President, Hon. Hubert Merryweather, that he be seated as a duly qualified senator from Apache County. His words were substantially as follows:
"I am a member of this Senate; my name is Lynn Lockhart. I have been appointed by the Governor of this State to serve as the second state senator from Apache County. I hand you my certificate of appointment, my noncommunistic oath, and my oath of office. There not appearing to be any desk available for me at this time, I will sit here until a desk is provided for me."
Apparently Mr. Lockhart then seated himself in a vacant chair on the Senate floor. Thereupon a motion to adjourn sine die was made and carried, and the senators left the chambers.
Defendant presently claims to hold and exercise the office of state senator, and to assume and perform the duties pertaining thereto, and to be entitled to receive the emoluments thereof.
Upon the verified complaint of the Senate president and pursuant to Section 28-301, A.C.A. 1939, the attorney general has brought this quo warranto action, asking that judgment of ouster be entered against defendant. Article 6, Section 4 of the Constitution of Arizona, confers upon this court original jurisdiction in quo warranto proceedings as to all state officers. Members of the legislature are undoubtedly state officers. While elected from a single county or a subdivision thereof, this fact cannot alter their official rank, which arises from the fact that the legislature is under our Constitution a co-ordinate branch of the state government. Certainly their duties *395 concern the state at large, for the legislature is an instrumentality appointed by the state to exercise a part of its sovereign powers. See Morril v. Haines, 2 N.H. 246; 42 Am.Jur., Public Officers, § 20; 49 Am.Jur., States, Territories and Dependencies, § 28. Therefore, it is of great public concern that only persons lawfully entitled thereto shall discharge the duties of a member of the state legislature, and from the facts here presented we deem the case to be a proper one for this court to exercise its original jurisdiction.
Some question is raised whether quo warranto is a proper proceeding to decide the problems here involved. We hold that it is. Section 28-301, A.C.A. 1939, says:
"An action may be brought by the attorney-general in the name of the state upon his relation, * * * upon the verified complaint of any person, in the Supreme Court, * * * against any person who usurps, intrudes into or who unlawfully holds or exercises any public office or any franchise within this state, and he shall bring such action whenever he has reason to believe that any such office or franchise is being usurped, intruded into or unlawfully held or exercised."
When defendant received a purported appointment by the highest executive officer of this state, and pursuant thereto took an oath of office, entered the Senate chambers, claimed to be a duly qualified and acting senator, and seated himself therein as a regular member of that body, he was more than a mere volunteer or interloper without color of right, and brought himself within the terms of our statute as one who "usurps, intrudes into or who unlawfully holds or exercises any public office." Whether the ancient prerogative writ would lie in these circumstances we need not decide. It suffices that there is a controversy justiciable by this court. We stated in State ex rel. Sullivan v. Moore, 49 Ariz. 51, 65, 64 P.2d 809, 815, "No officer nor tribunal other than the courts may determine whether an election or appointment is void or not." Nor is this exercise of jurisdiction by the courts an encroachment upon the power of the legislature to judge the qualifications of its own members. See State v. O'Brien, 47 Ohio St. 464, 25 N.E. 121.
The constitutional amendment in question embraces both (a) an increase in the size of the Senate, and (b) a limitation on the future membership of the House to freeze it at its present size, accomplished by a changed basis of apportionment. It is contended that the amendment never became part of the Constitution of this state because the manner in which it was submitted to a vote of the people violated Article *396 21, Section 1, of the Constitution of Arizona, which provides in part as follows:
"* * * If more than one proposed amendment shall be submitted at any election, such proposed amendments shall be submitted in such manner that the electors may vote for or against such proposed amendments separately.
We believe the prohibition of Article 21, Section 1 was not violated, and we shall proceed to point out why. In the case of Kerby v. Luhrs, 44 Ariz. 208, 36 P.2d 549, 554, 94 A.L.R. 1502, this court laid down the yardstick to be used in determining what matters fall within the ban of the constitutional provision, and said:
"If the different changes contained in the proposed amendment all cover matters necessary to be dealt with in some manner, in order that the Constitution, as amended, shall constitute a consistent and workable whole on the general topic embraced in that part which is amended, and if, logically speaking, they should stand or fall as a whole, then there is but one amendment submitted. But, if any one of the propositions, although not directly contradicting the others, does not refer to such matters, or if it is not such that the voter supporting it would reasonably be expected to support the principle of the others, then there are in reality two or more amendments to be submitted, and the proposed amendment falls within the constitutional prohibition."
In applying that gauge to the facts shown therein, the court had no hesitancy in declaring as "log rolling of the worst type" and violative of "both the spirit and the letter of the Constitution", three new proposed amendments to the Constitution to be voted on as a single measure. The amendments would have (a) made the Tax Commission a constitutional body, (b) changed the method of taxing public utilities, and (c) changed the procedure by which copper mines should be taxed. It had been contended that all of said measures fell under the general head of "taxation".
Deciding just what changes do or do not fall within the purview of the prohibition becomes a matter of applying reason to fact. At the outset it should be stated that courts do not lightly declare laws unconstitutional, and we agree with the Supreme Court of Colorado that:
"* * * every reasonable presumption, both of law and fact, is to be indulged in favor of the validity of an amendment to the Constitution when it is attacked after its ratification by the people. * * *" People ex rel. Elder v. Sours, 31 Colo. 369, 74 P. 167, 169; Cf. State v. Gastelum, 75 Ariz. 271, 255 P.2d 203; Duhame v. State Tax Commission, 65 Ariz. 268, 179 P.2d 252, 171 A.L.R. 684.
*397 Since the organization of the Territory of Arizona in the year 1863, the Legislative Assembly, as our legislative body was known prior to statehood, was composed of two bodies, viz.: the Council and the House of Representatives. With the framing and adoption of the Constitution of Arizona in the year 1912, and at all times since, the provisions for the composition and apportionment of the two houses of the legislature have been consolidated into Article 4, Part 2, Section 1, subsection (1), thereof, as a Senate and House of Representatives. Until the adoption of the amendment now in question the Senate membership, by constitutional mandate, has remained the same, i.e., nineteen members to be elected in the fourteen counties according to the apportionment heretofore set forth. However, the people through the initiative, first in the year 1918 (see Sess. Laws Arizona 1919, Initiative and Referendum Measures, p. 7), and later in the year 1932 (see Sess. Laws Arizona 1933, p. 619) amended said subsection and changed the size and apportionment formula for the House membership, while leaving unchanged the Senate membership, although somewhat different phraseology was used each time to accomplish this last result.
True, only the latest amendment has changed the number of senators from any county, but each amendment was an amendment of the whole subsection. Although it did not change the number of senators, it amended the previous provisions just as much as if it had changed the number. The question of change in the number of senators has nothing to do with the problem, the question is whether a provision as to senators and their apportionment to the counties may logically and lawfully be coupled with a provision as to representatives and their apportionment. Clearly both relate to, and are germane to, one general subject, i.e., the composition of the state legislature, and historically the people of this state have considered that but one subject was involved, to-wit: "The Legislature", albeit that legislature is bicameral. We cannot say that the people of this state in dealing with this subject for the past forty years have erred and acted unreasonably in treating their legislature as a single subject in constitutional amendments. We hold that but one proposed amendment was submitted to a vote of the people, and the legislature did not violate Article 21, Section 1, of the Constitution.
The action of the governor in appointing defendant necessarily is founded upon the premise that proclamation of the amendment made it law, and that the law operated eo instanti to create the second office of senator from Apache County and to create a short term thereof to which defendant could be appointed. If this premise be false, all else falls with it. The date a measure becomes law and the date it becomes operative may be the same, as in Priser v. Frohmiller, 42 Ariz. 30, 21 P.2d 927, but, the authorities agree, and reason *398 compels us to accept as true, that the date a provision becomes law and the date it becomes operative may be different. 16 C.J.S., Constitutional Law, § 39. For example, a provision that today becomes part of the body of law of the state may by its terms declare that beginning one year from the date thereof an officer shall have certain powers conferred upon him. While the law exists as law in the interim, it operates to confer the powers only upon the day specified. Let us examine the amendment here with a view to determining at what time it operates to create the term of office which defendant purports to occupy.
It is fundamental that "The prime effort in construing Constitutions or statutes is to ascertain the intention of those who framed them * * *." Clark v. Boyce, 20 Ariz. 544, 185 P. 136, 140. In 11 Am.Jur., Constitutional Law, Sec. 61, the rule is phrased:
"The fundamental principle of constitutional construction is to give effect to the intent of the framers of the organic law and of the people adopting it. A constitutional clause must be construed reasonably to carry out the intention of the framers, which gives rise to the corollary that it should not be construed so as to defeat the obvious intent if another construction equally in accordance with the words and sense may be adopted which will enforce and carry out the intent. The intent must be gathered from both the letter and spirit of the document.
"It has been very appropriately stated that the polestar in the construction of Constitutions is the intention of the makers and adopters.
"Wherever the purpose of the framers of a Constitution is clearly expressed, it will be followed by the courts. Even where terms of a constitutional provision are not entirely free from doubt, they must be interpreted as nearly as possible in consonance with the objects and purposes in contemplation at the time of their adoption, because in construing a constitutional provision, its general scope and object should be considered.
Of course no constitutional provision is to be construed piece-meal, and regard must be had to the whole of the provision and its relation to other parts of the Constitution.
Guided by the foregoing principles, our examination of the amendment has convinced us defendant purports to hold a nonexistent term of office. The amendment begins by declaring "The Senate shall consist of two members from each county elected at large." (Emphasis supplied.) The word "elected" here can refer only to the regular election processes provided for by the Constitution and laws of this state. Certainly nothing in the phraseology of the amendment leads us to believe *399 it was the intent of the electorate to have the amendment become effective instanter and of itself create a term for the new offices. To uphold the appointment we would be forced to read into the amendment something conspicuously absent from it, namely, the creation of a "short term" to be filled by appointment, for the nine new offices. We reject such a strained interpretation, and hold the legal effect of the amendment was to create, at the time it was proclaimed to be law, the nine additional senate offices therein named, and that it was intended the terms thereof should commence when the offices had been filled by persons elected in the manner other senators are elected.
The second sentence of the amendment declares "Beginning with the Twenty-second Legislature the House of Representatives shall be composed * * *." Here the matter is left in no doubt whatsoever, it is spelled out clearly and completely, and in unmistakable terms tells us the change wrought in the manner of apportioning the House of Representatives is not effective until the 1954 elections are held. Here it is both possible and reasonable to read the provisions as to the House as applicable to the Senate, not merely because the provisions follow one another in the amendment, but because the sense of the amendment as a whole when read by an intelligent voter is that it was not meant to become operative as to either house until the next elections. We reiterate, the amendment treats with but one subject, "The Legislature", and the changes made are changes in that legislature. There is one amendment, and one set of changes, and ordinarily we should expect but one date for the changes to become effective.
We are not impressed with the construction urged by defendant that it was intended during the interim we should have a legislature with an increased Senate membership but with an unchanged House apportionment. To say the new offices are created and the term thereof becomes presently effective (the vacancy thus resulting to be filled by appointment), would in our opinion be in direct conflict with the plain language of the amendment, and the result would be to deprive the people in the nine counties granted an additional senator, of the privilege of exercising their electoral franchise to select the person to fill the office. We believe this was never the intent of the electorate, for they have ever jealously guarded their right to elect their public officials and vested the appointing power in other hands only in exceptional cases. For example, see Chapter 135, Laws 1947 (now Section 19-210 of the 1952 Cumulative Supplement), enlarging the membership of the Supreme Court. A departure from this policy would have to be declared in clearer words than are here found.
Furthermore, we note that the amendment was proposed by a concurrent resolution of the legislature, and therein it was *400 provided that it should be submitted to a vote of the people at the next regular general election, or at a special election called for that purpose. This meant that possibly there would be no submission to the electorate until November, 1954, which indicates the legislature never intended there be any term other than the regular two-year term provided for by Article 4, Part 2, Section 21, of the Constitution, which reads:
"The members of the first legislature shall hold office until the first Monday in January, 1913. The terms of office of the members of succeeding legislatures shall be two years."
It appears that another court has reached a similar conclusion upon a comparable fact situation. In State ex rel. Sanchez v. Dixon, La. App., 4 So.2d 591, 595, the issue presented was whether the governor could appoint as interim appointments, four additional police jurors, under an act authorizing the creation of these offices upon varying population increases. The court said:
"The general rule is that, where no time is fixed for the beginning of the term of an elective office, it begins at the time the office is filled by an election, and if the office is an appointive one, the term begins when the appointment is made. So, where an election is necessary, the term does not begin until after that election is held. 46 C.J., pages 965, 966; 22 R.C.L. p. 550, Sec. 251; State [ex rel. Foot] v. Rogge, 80 Mont. 1, 257 P. 1029; State [ex rel. Kriebs] v. Halladay, 52 S.D. 497, 219 N.W. 125 et seq.; People [ex rel. Quereau] v. Hamrock, 74 Colo. 411, 222 P. 391."
Cf. Graham v. Lockhart, 53 Ariz. 531, 91 P.2d 265; People ex rel. Bagshaw v. Thompson, 55 Cal. App.2d 147, 130 P.2d 237; State ex rel. Rosenthal v. Smiley, 304 Mo. 549, 263 S.W. 825; and State ex rel. Cotter v. Leipner, 138 Conn. 153, 83 A.2d 169. Following the analysis of the Louisiana court, the failure of the amendment to declare otherwise means the office, though created, was not to be filled until the beginning of the term prescribed by law. The new term not yet having come into existence, there is no vacancy to be filled.
It is the judgment of the court that the defendant is guilty of usurping or intruding into the State Senate, in that he is claiming without right to be a member thereof as a Senator from Apache County, and he is therefore ordered ousted and excluded from said legislative body.

PER CURIAM:
              Case: 13-14229     Date Filed: 07/09/2014   Page: 2 of 4


      Donyel James Fitts appeals his three consecutive life terms of supervised

release, imposed after he pled guilty to three counts of production of child

pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2251(a) and (e). We affirm.

                                I. BACKGROUND

      Fitts was arrested after his girlfriend notified the Jackson County, Florida,

Sheriff’s Office she had found a digital camera containing child pornography. The

camera contained video showing the victim, his girlfriend’s four-year-old-

daughter, performing oral sex on Fitts, as well as nude pictures of the victim.

      A federal grand jury indicted Fitts on four counts of production of child

pornography. Fitts pled guilty to three of the counts in exchange for the

government’s dismissal of the remaining count. During his sentencing hearing,

Fitts asked the district judge to impose consecutive 15-year sentences for each

count, the mandatory minimum for each offense. The government joined in the

request. Fitts was sentenced to consecutive 15-year sentences for each count; a

total of 45 years of imprisonment. The district judge also imposed three

consecutive life terms of supervised release. Neither party objected.

                                 II. DISCUSSION

      On appeal, Fitts argues the district judge plainly erred, when he imposed

consecutive, rather than concurrent, supervised-release terms, in violation of 18

U.S.C. § 3624(e) and U.S.S.G. § 5G1.2. When a convicted defendant did not raise

               Case: 13-14229     Date Filed: 07/09/2014    Page: 3 of 4


a sentencing error before the district judge, we review for plain error only. See

United States v. Rodriguez, 627 F.3d 1372, 1380 (11th Cir. 2010). Establishing

plain error requires the defendant show (1) an error (2) that was plain, (3) affected

one’s substantial rights, and (4) seriously affected the fairness of the judicial

proceedings. Id.

      Fitts argues the district judge erred by imposing three consecutive life terms

of supervised release. Under the clear language of 18 U.S.C. § 3624(e), terms of

supervised release must run concurrently. 18 U.S.C. § 3624(e); U.S.S.G. § 5G1.2,

comment. (n.2(C)); United States v. Magluta, 198 F.3d 1265, 1283 (11th Cir.

1999), vacated in part on other grounds, 203 F.3d 1304 (11th Cir. 2000).

Therefore, the district judge committed error that was plain, when he sentenced

Fitts to consecutive, rather than concurrent, supervised-release terms. See

Magluta, 198 F.3d at 1283.

      The error, however, did not affect Fitts’s substantial rights, because his total

term of supervised release, life, would remain the same even without the error. See

United States v. Gallego, 247 F.3d 1191, 1200 n.19 (11th Cir. 2001) (recognizing

combining consecutive sentences “to equal life imprisonment are effectively the

same as one sentence of life imprisonment,” and a defendant’s substantial rights

are unaffected by affirming the sentence”). Fitts has identified no consequences,

collateral or otherwise, from the imposition of consecutive life terms of supervised



                                           3
               Case: 13-14229     Date Filed: 07/09/2014    Page: 4 of 4


release that could affect his substantial rights. Therefore, he has failed to satisfy

the third prong of the plain-error test.

      AFFIRMED.

                          OPINION

BYBEE, Circuit Judge:

   California prisoner Michael D. Slovik petitions for a writ
of habeas corpus, contending that his confrontation rights
under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United
States Constitution were violated when a California trial court
prevented him from asking questions on cross-examination
that would establish that one of the prosecution’s key wit-
nesses had likely lied under oath. The district court denied the
petition. For the reasons explained below, we agree that
Slovik was denied his confrontation rights and that the right
was clearly established; accordingly, we reverse.

             I.   FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS

This case arises out of a billiard ball fight—not a billiard hall
fight, although it certainly was that as well—but a fight
involving billiard balls. On the evening of November 20,
1998, Slovik was drinking at a bar named Gusser’s Carousel.
1518                        SLOVIK v. YATES
It is clear that a bar fight occurred that night, and that Slovik
was one of the main belligerents in that fight. After that, the
details get kind of hazy. The various witnesses and
participants—as the State points out, indisputably not picked
from a Sunday school choir—offered conflicting testimony.1

   The prosecution relied largely on the eyewitness testimony
of the bartender, Katherine Buckley-Stoffel, and bar patrons
Mark Featherstone, Marilyn Woods, and Zachary Johnson.
The defense relied on the eyewitness testimony of bar patron
Bridgett Lewis. The trial error that is the subject of this appeal
occurred during Featherstone’s testimony. We are going to
relate the story as each of the witnesses recounted it.

   Buckley-Stoffel testified that at approximately 1:00 a.m.
she stopped serving Slovik alcohol because he was intoxi-
cated and antagonistic. In response, Slovik threw a tip at
Buckley-Stoffel, yelled obscenities, and threatened to kill her
as he was escorted outside. After Slovik was removed from
the bar, Buckley-Stoffel attempted to shut and lock the door,
but Slovik grabbed it, pushed her back inside, and then
shoved her and punched her in the shoulder. She testified that
Slovik grabbed pool balls2 and threw one toward Lewis and
  1
     Our recitation of the facts is drawn from the findings of fact in the
opinion of the California Court of Appeal, whose findings are presumed
correct unless rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C.
§ 2254(e)(1). Neither Slovik nor the State has challenged these findings.
   2
     At oral argument, counsel for both sides indicated that cue balls were
thrown. We are fairly confident that not everyone was throwing cue balls,
although the record doesn’t reveal whether one side was stripes and the
other solids. Given that there seems to have been only one pool table at
the bar, there would only have been a single cue ball. Therefore, if Slovik
threw multiple balls they must have been pool balls and not cue balls. In
addition to the difference in color (the cue ball is, of course, white), on
coin-operated tables the owners use slightly larger and heavier cue balls,
or occasionally magnetic cue balls in order to ensure that the cue ball is
returned to the game after a scratch. See EWA MATAYA LAURANCE &
THOMAS C. SHAW, THE COMPLETE IDIOT’S GUIDE TO POOL & BILLIARDS 90
(1998).

one toward her, which came within six inches of her head and
broke the Plexiglas wall covering behind her. Buckley-Stoffel
saw Slovik on the floor with Featherstone standing over him
and then saw Slovik chasing Featherstone.

   Featherstone testified that Buckley-Stoffel took Slovik’s
drink after Slovik did backflips through the bar. According to
Featherstone, when Buckley-Stoffel asked Slovik to leave,
Slovik yelled, cursed and shoved her. Buckley-Stoffel
screamed for Featherstone to call 911. Featherstone further
testified that as he attempted to shut the door, Slovik grabbed
it and reentered the bar, shoving both Featherstone and
Buckley-Stoffel against the wall. Slovik chased Lewis, and
then slipped on pool sticks he had knocked down earlier. Fea-
therstone denied touching Slovik, but claimed that Slovik
chased him around the pool table, and threw two pool balls at
his face. When Featherstone ducked, the balls hit the wall,
and Slovik then threw a third ball.

   The incident that is the basis for Slovik’s habeas petition
occurred during Featherstone’s cross-examination. Feather-
stone was asked whether he was currently on probation. He
answered “no.” Slovik’s counsel apparently had a form estab-
lishing that Featherstone had been placed on five-years’ pro-
bation for driving under the influence of alcohol, and he
wished to impeach Featherstone with this evidence. After an
unreported side-bar discussion, the trial court apparently sus-
tained a prosecution objection under California Evidence
Code § 352 to any further questioning of Featherstone about
his probationary status, ruling the inquiry would be too time
consuming. Although, due to the unrecorded side-bar, the
written record is ambiguous as to what exactly Slovik’s coun-
sel was attempting to introduce, at oral argument the State
conceded that Slovik’s counsel was not permitted to show
Featherstone the document and ask him an “isn’t it true that”
question.

  Woods testified that Johnson jumped on Slovik and they
began scuffling. Woods also testified that after Johnson and
1520                      SLOVIK v. YATES
Slovik scuffled, others unsuccessfully tried to remove Slovik
from the bar. Featherstone called 911 and Johnson ran out the
back door. Woods confirmed that Slovik shoved Buckley-
Stoffel and hit Buckley-Stoffel’s arm. She testified that while
Featherstone was on the other side of the pool table egging
him on, Slovik grabbed two pool balls and threw one of them.

   Johnson testified that he went to assist in the effort to
remove Slovik from the bar. According to Johnson, Slovik
swung at Buckley-Stoffel and missed, and when Johnson
stepped in the way, Slovik swung at him instead, and they
began fighting. Johnson hit Slovik twice in the back of the
head and they fell.

   The defense relied principally on the testimony of Lewis,
another customer at the bar that night. According to Lewis,
Slovik was intoxicated and belligerent and refused to leave
until Buckley-Stoffel accompanied him to the door. When
Lewis heard a disturbance, she went outside and witnessed
Johnson holding Slovik in a chokehold against a car, as John-
son’s sister screamed to “let him go!” Lewis testified that
Slovik followed Johnson back into the bar, and when Lewis
and Buckley-Stoffel attempted to shut the door, Slovik pushed
Buckley-Stoffel aside and entered the bar. Lewis then kicked
Slovik; he threatened her, and she ran outside. Lewis wit-
nessed Featherstone pushing Slovik, and then kicking and
pushing him back down when he tried to get up. Lewis testi-
fied that after Slovik got up he angrily threw pool balls in an
erratic fashion “not to pinpoint anybody out. He was just
throwing them to throw them.” On cross-examination Lewis
testified that she was unsure what he was trying to hit: “I
guess people. I don’t know how.” She further testified that as
Slovik moved toward the door, Featherstone threw a ball in
that direction.3
  3
   Lewis testified that when the police asked them to write statements,
they discussed the events among themselves, and Featherstone indicated
that they should not mention that he had pushed or kicked Slovik.
                             SLOVIK v. YATES                           1521
   As a result of the bar fight, Slovik was charged with assault
with a deadly weapon (the pool balls) and by means of force
likely to produce great bodily injury upon Buckley-Stoffel
(count one), and upon Featherstone (count two) in violation
of California Penal Code § 245(a)(1); and battery upon Fea-
therstone (count three) and Buckley-Stoffel (count four) in
violation of California Penal Code § 242. A jury found Slovik
guilty of counts two and four as charged, guilty of the lesser
included offense of simple assault for count one, and not
guilty of count three. On June 28, 1999, the trial court sen-
tenced Slovik to 40 years to life as a result of the California
three-strikes law and other sentencing enhancements.

   Slovik appealed his conviction on numerous grounds. The
California Court of Appeal affirmed Slovik’s conviction on
the merits, but struck some of the sentencing enhancements in
an unpublished decision. The California Supreme Court
denied Slovik’s petition for review. In September 2001,
Slovik was resentenced to 35 years to life, which the Califor-
nia Court of Appeal affirmed in another unpublished decision.
Slovik then filed a state habeas corpus petition, which was
denied by the Superior Court, the state appellate court, and the
California Supreme Court.

   In February 2005, Slovik filed a 28 U.S.C. § 2254 petition
for writ of habeas corpus in federal district court. Magistrate

Although she wrote that Slovik hit Buckley-Stoffel, she testified that she
meant that he pushed Buckley-Stoffel when being escorted out of the bar.
She explained that she did not mention the parking lot fight in her state-
ment because the police told them to write about the incident in the bar.
Lewis also failed to note in her written statement that Featherstone had
thrown a pool ball, but she testified that she decided to tell the truth when
she learned that Slovik would receive a long sentence.
   A defense investigator testified that when he interviewed Lewis she
never mentioned anyone besides Slovik throwing pool balls, but she did
state that Featherstone pushed Slovik to the ground and then kicked him,
and that Buckley-Stoffel and Featherstone did not plan to inform the
police about either that or the parking lot fight.
1522                         SLOVIK v. YATES
Judge Stiven recommended that the habeas petition be denied,
and Judge Benitez adopted that recommendation and denied
the petition on May 1, 2006. Slovik timely appealed.

                          II.   DISCUSSION

   This case is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective
Death Penalty Act (“AEDPA”), 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).4 See
Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320, 327 (1997). Under AEDPA,
we may not grant Slovik habeas relief unless the last reasoned
state court adjudication, here the California Court of Appeal’s
first unpublished decision addressing the merits of his case,
“(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an
unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,
as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or
(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable
determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented
  4
    After briefing, oral argument, and publication of an opinion in this
case, the State argued for the first time in a petition for rehearing that
Slovik did not sufficiently raise a Confrontation Clause argument in state
court proceedings. Moreover, Slovik apparently cannot return to state
court to raise a Confrontation Clause claim because he failed to raise the
argument in his original state habeas petition. See In re Clark, 855 P.2d
729, 760 (Cal. 1993) (holding that “absent justification for the failure to
present all known claims in a single, timely petition for writ of habeas cor-
pus, successive and/or untimely petitions will be summarily denied”).
Accordingly, Slovik is no longer subject to an exhaustion requirement, but
he has procedurally defaulted his Confrontation Clause claim. See Frank-
lin v. Johnson, 290 F.3d 1223, 1229-32 (9th Cir. 2002). We find, however,
that the State has forfeited this procedural default argument, and we refuse
to raise the issue sua sponte. See id.; Vang v. Nevada, 329 F.3d 1069, 1073
(9th Cir. 2003).
   In similar circumstances, the court in Franklin, 290 F.3d at 1233, went
on to review the petitioner’s claim under AEDPA’s deferential standard
despite the fact that the issue had not been raised in state court. However,
in Chaker v. Crogan, 428 F.3d 1215, 1221 (9th Cir. 2005), the court held
that when a state has forfeited a procedural default argument we review
the claim de novo. We need not resolve any tension between these cases,
because we conclude that under either standard, a writ of habeas must be
issued.
                        SLOVIK v. YATES                    1523
in the State court proceeding.” 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). We
review de novo a district court’s decision to deny a habeas
petition. Campbell v. Rice, 408 F.3d 1166, 1169 (9th Cir.
2005) (en banc).

   We granted a certificate of appealability on two questions:
(1) whether Slovik’s constitutional rights were violated by the
trial court’s exclusion of evidence that would have impeached
Featherstone; and (2) whether Slovik’s right to present a
defense was violated by the assault instruction given to the
jury. Because we find the limitation on use of impeachment
evidence for cross-examination adequate to grant the petition,
we do not reach the jury instruction issue.

A.   Confrontation Clause Violation

   [1] The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment
guarantees a criminal defendant the right “to be confronted
with the witnesses against him.” U.S. CONST. amend. VI. The
Supreme Court has explained that the right of confrontation
“means more than being allowed to confront the witness
physically,” but rather “[t]he main and essential purpose of
confrontation is to secure for the opponent the opportunity of
cross-examination.” Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 315-16
(1974) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The
Confrontation Clause does not prevent a trial judge from
imposing “reasonable limits on such cross-examination based
on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice,
confusion of the issues, the witness’ safety, or interrogation
that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.” Delaware v.
Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679 (1986). Nevertheless, the
Court has held that a defendant’s Confrontation Clause rights
have been violated when he is “prohibited from engaging in
otherwise appropriate cross-examination . . . and thereby ‘to
expose to the jury the facts from which jurors . . . could
appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the
witness.’ ” Id. at 680 (quoting Davis, 415 U.S. at 318). “[A]
criminal defendant states a violation of the Confrontation
1524                       SLOVIK v. YATES
Clause by showing that he was prohibited from engaging in
otherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to show a
prototypical form of bias on the part of the witness.” Id.
Accordingly, the defendant has met his burden when he has
shown that “[a] reasonable jury might have received a signifi-
cantly different impression of [a witness’] credibility had . . .
counsel been permitted to pursue his proposed line of cross-
examination.” Id.

   [2] Slovik’s Sixth Amendment right to be confronted with
the witnesses against him was violated because a reasonable
jury might have received a “significantly different impres-
sion” of Featherstone’s credibility had Slovik been permitted
to confront Featherstone with the record of probation and
cross-examine him concerning his apparent lie under oath.
See id. During his cross-examination of Featherstone,
Slovik’s counsel asked “You’re currently on probation right
now?” to which Featherstone responded “No.” When, during
cross-examination, Slovik’s counsel attempted to approach
Featherstone with evidence that Featherstone was in fact on
probation, the trial court denied permission to approach the
witness with that evidence. Had Slovik’s counsel been permit-
ted to ask Featherstone something along the lines of “isn’t it
true that you are currently on probation for driving under the
influence of alcohol?” Slovik might have shown that Feather-
stone’s prior statement, made under oath, that he was not on
probation was a lie.5

  [3] The evidence that Featherstone was placed on five-
years’ probation for driving under the influence was not being
proffered to establish that Featherstone was unreliable simply
because he was on probation, but rather to establish that Fea-
  5
    At oral argument the State suggested that Featherstone was not neces-
sarily lying because he may not have known that he was on probation. We
find it extremely improbable that a person is unaware that he is on proba-
tion. In any event, that argument should have been left to counsel and
resolved by the jury.
                             SLOVIK v. YATES                           1525
therstone was unreliable because he had lied about being on
probation and to establish that he had an ulterior motive to
place the blame on Slovik so as not to admit to violating the
terms of his probation.6 It is clear to us that the jurors might
have formed a significantly different impression of Feather-
stone’s credibility if they had heard cross-examination show-
ing that Featherstone was willing to lie under oath and that he
had a motive for lying because of the terms of his probation
status. Therefore, the trial court’s refusal to allow Slovik to
present such evidence violated Slovik’s constitutional rights
under the Sixth Amendment, so clearly set forth in Van Ars-
dall and Davis.

   The State concedes that the exclusion of the proffered
impeachment cross-examination would violate Slovik’s Sixth
Amendment confrontation rights if the excluded testimony
would have produced a significantly different impression of
the witness’ credibility, but it contends that exclusion of
cross-examination with the record of Featherstone’s probation
did not significantly alter the jurors’ impression of Feather-
stone’s credibility. Inexplicably, the State argues that “[j]urors
could reasonably infer from defense counsel’s cross-
  6
    Slovik argues that if Featherstone was on probation, he would have had
an additional motive for lying about whether he attacked Slovik first,
because an assault or battery charge would have violated the terms of his
probation. The State argues that Slovik never advised the trial court, pur-
suant to California Evidence Code § 354(a), that he intended to pursue
evidence of Featherstone’s current probation status to show Featherstone
had a motive for testifying falsely. California evidentiary law is irrelevant
to the determination of Slovik’s constitutional rights, and we find Slovik’s
argument sufficient to raise the issue to the state trial court. The record
clearly indicates that Slovik argued that he should have had the opportu-
nity to question Featherstone regarding his probationary status under
Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308 (1974). Davis involved the right to confront
a witness based on his motive to lie due to his probationary status. Id. at
319. Insofar as the State now wishes to assert that Slovik is procedurally
barred by failing to raise this issue in the state courts of appeal, we find
that the State has forfeited the argument by failing to raise it prior to the
filing of its petition for rehearing. See Franklin, 290 F.3d at 1229-32.
1526                    SLOVIK v. YATES
examination question and Featherstone’s answer that Feather-
stone committed an offense resulting in a prior placement on
probation.” The entire exchange proceeded as follows:
Slovik’s counsel asked Featherstone, “You’re currently on
probation right now?” to which Featherstone responded “No.”
It is baffling how jurors could reasonably infer from this
exchange that Featherstone committed an offense resulting in
a prior placement on probation. The only conclusion that a
juror could reasonably draw is that Slovik’s counsel was
attempting to impeach Featherstone’s credibility, but failed.
Indeed, because use of the evidence was prohibited, it would
have been improper for the jurors to read anything else into
the exchange. The State has not offered any reason why the
jury would suspect that Featherstone was lying when he
answered “No.” The jurors were left to assume that Slovik’s
counsel was fishing and that Featherstone testified honestly.

   The State also contends that the trial court’s ruling did not
significantly alter the jury’s impression of Featherstone’s
credibility because Slovik’s trial counsel had already estab-
lished that some of the prosecution’s witnesses were regular
bar patrons, and some were on probation, and that this “suf-
ficed to dispel any lingering illusions that the prosecutor
picked his witnesses from a Sunday school choir.” This argu-
ment fails to recognize the effect that cross-examination
might have had on the jurors’ perception of the individual wit-
ness. Although we will consider this argument again in our
harmless error analysis, the fact that defense counsel
impeached other witnesses bears no relevance in the confron-
tation right analysis, which asks whether impeaching Feather-
stone would have produced a significantly different
impression of Featherstone’s credibility. Featherstone was an
important witness. He was in the middle of the dust-up and,
if his testimony was believed, was a victim of Slovik’s
billiard-ball assault. The Supreme Court has emphasized that
“the focus of the Confrontation Clause is on individual wit-
nesses” and thus “the focus of the prejudice inquiry in deter-
mining whether the confrontation right has been violated must
                        SLOVIK v. YATES                       1527
be on the particular witness, not on the outcome of the entire
trial.” Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 680. That defense counsel was
able to impeach other witnesses is irrelevant to whether the
trial court’s limit on Slovik’s ability to cross-examine Fea-
therstone violated the Confrontation Clause.

  [4] The California Court of Appeal analyzed Slovik’s claim
as an evidentiary issue governed by state law, rather than a
confrontation question governed by the Sixth Amendment.
The California Court of Appeal approved the trial court’s rul-
ing under California Evidence Code § 352, which states:

     The court in its discretion may exclude evidence if
     its probative value is substantially outweighed by the
     probability that its admission will (a) necessitate
     undue consumption of time or (b) create substantial
     danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the issues,
     or of misleading the jury.

Applying a California evidentiary standard of review, the
Court of Appeal concluded that “[a]bsent a clear showing of
abuse, the trial court’s exercise of discretion under this section
will not be reversed.” See People v. Avila, 133 P.3d 1076,
1137 (Cal. 2006) (“We review for abuse of discretion a trial
court’s rulings on relevance and the exclusion of evidence
under Evidence Code section 352.”). AEDPA gives us no
basis here for questioning a California court’s decision apply-
ing its own evidentiary rules. However, had the Court of
Appeal applied Van Arsdall and Davis, we believe it would
have come to a different conclusion. In this regard, the Cali-
fornia Court of Appeal’s decision was objectively unreason-
able in light of clearly established Supreme Court precedent
regarding the Confrontation Clause.

B.   Harmless Error Analysis

   [5] Confrontation Clause errors are subject to harmless-
error analysis. Normally, for constitutional errors “[t]he cor-
1528                    SLOVIK v. YATES
rect inquiry is whether, assuming that the damaging potential
of the cross-examination were fully realized, a reviewing
court might nonetheless say that the error was harmless
beyond a reasonable doubt.” Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 684.
However, in reviewing state court decisions for harmless error
in the context of a habeas petition, federal courts review to
determine if the error had “a substantial and injurious effect
or influence in determining the jury’s verdict.” Brecht v.
Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 623 (1993) (quoting Kotteakos v.
United States, 328 U.S. 750, 776 (1946)); see Fry v. Pliler,
127 S. Ct. 2321, 2325-27 (2007). “If a habeas court is left
with ‘grave doubt’ about whether a constitutional error sub-
stantially influenced the verdict, then the error was not harm-
less.” Parle v. Runnels, 387 F.3d 1030, 1044 (9th Cir. 2004).
In making this inquiry, the court must review the record to
determine “what effect the error had or reasonably may be
taken to have had upon the jury’s decision.” McKinney v.
Rees, 993 F.2d 1378, 1385-86 (9th Cir. 1993) (quoting Kot-
teakos, 328 U.S. at 764). In any particular case the relevant
factors include “the importance of the witness’ testimony in
the prosecution’s case, whether the testimony was cumulative,
the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contra-
dicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the
extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of
course, the overall strength of the prosecution’s case.” Id.

   Applying these factors, we conclude that the trial court’s
limit on Slovik’s ability to cross-examine Featherstone had a
substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the
jury’s verdict. Assuming, as we must, that the damaging
potential of Featherstone’s cross-examination was fully real-
ized, Fowler v. Sacramento County Sheriff’s Dep’t, 421 F.3d
1027, 1041 (9th Cir. 2005), we are left with a grave doubt as
to whether the trial error had a substantial influence on the
jury’s decision.

  [6] The conviction at issue in Slovik’s habeas petition is
count two, assault with a deadly weapon, for throwing pool
                        SLOVIK v. YATES                      1529
balls at Featherstone. Featherstone’s testimony is critical to
that conviction because Featherstone testified plainly that
Slovik threw one or more pool balls at him. The only other
witness who testified that Slovik may have thrown a pool ball
at Featherstone is Woods. According to the California Court
of Appeal, Woods testified that “while Featherstone was on
the other side of the pool table egging him on, [Slovik] threw
one of the balls.” Given that Slovik’s defense was based on
self-defense, and he argued that Featherstone was the aggres-
sor, a reasonable jury would have had a much more difficult
decision on a charged count of assault with a deadly weapon
based solely on Woods’ testimony—that Slovik “threw one of
the balls” while Featherstone was egging him on. Woods’ tes-
timony did not even indicate that Slovik was aiming at Fea-
therstone, as opposed to just throwing a ball aimlessly.
Moreover, Woods only testified that Slovik threw one ball
and does not indicate the target of that ball, whereas Feather-
stone contended that Slovik threw three balls at him. Other
witnesses testified either that Slovik threw pool balls haphaz-
ardly, or that he threw them at others. Lewis, for example, tes-
tified that Slovik “was just throwing [pool balls] to throw
them” and was not trying “to pinpoint anybody.” Feather-
stone’s testimony thus appears crucial to the prosecution’s
case and is not cumulative. We gravely doubt whether the
prosecution’s case was so strong that the trial court’s decision
to exclude cross-examination on evidence discrediting Fea-
therstone did not have a substantial and injurious impact on
the jury’s decision.

   The State does not attempt to argue that its case was partic-
ularly strong, or that Featherstone was inconsequential to its
conviction. Rather, the State alleges that even if the state court
committed constitutional error, “the state court trial jurors
knew that none of the trial witnesses led a purely law-abiding
life.” We are not sure what we should take from this admis-
sion. This argument is presumably an attempt to show that the
testimony was cumulative, but it merely serves to emphasize
that the State’s case rested on the testimony of shaky wit-
1530                         SLOVIK v. YATES
nesses and reminds us that if these witnesses were further
contradicted, the jury might not have returned a conviction.

   The California Court of Appeal found “harmless error in
the court’s excluding evidence a witness was on probation
when the witness testified to the contrary.” People v. Slovik,
No. SCE193584, at 2 (Cal. Ct. App. filed Mar. 2, 2001). The
court provided no reasoning to support that statement. The
court’s analysis is limited to another conclusory statement that
“there is no reasonable probability of a different result had the
court allowed questioning of Featherstone’s probationary sta-
tus.” Id. at 13. The court fails to explain why there is no rea-
sonable probability of a different result, in light of any of the
factors provided by the Supreme Court to guide the harmless
error inquiry. Instead, the court just concludes for a third time
that “[t]he fact [that] the defense was not allowed to question
Featherstone further about whether he was on probation did
not result in a miscarriage of justice.” Id.

   [7] We review a state court decision regarding harmless
error to determine if it “is contrary to Supreme Court prece-
dent or objectively unreasonable.” Inthavong v. Lamarque,
420 F.3d 1055, 1059 (9th Cir. 2005).7 Although it is unclear
whether the California Court of Appeal simply failed to con-
duct a harmless error analysis, or whether it misapplied that
analysis, its conclusion that the trial court’s exclusion of the
evidence of Featherstone’s probation was harmless error
either contradicted or unreasonably applied established fed-
  7
    Here, because Slovik failed to directly raise the Confrontation Clause
issue, the California Court of Appeal appears to have applied the state
harmless error standard under People v. Watson, 299 P.2d 243, 253-55
(Cal. 1956), rather than the constitutional harmless error standard under
Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967). As noted above, we find
that the State has forfeited any procedural default argument on this issue
by failing to bring it to the attention of the court prior to filing a petition
for rehearing. Under either de novo review, see Chaker, 428 F.3d at 1221,
or the more deferential standard under AEDPA, see Franklin, 290 F.3d at
1233, we conclude that the writ of habeas must be issued.

eral law as determined by Supreme Court precedent. See Van
Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 684.

                     III.     CONCLUSION

   [8] We reverse the denial of the petition, and direct the dis-
trict court to issue an order stating that a writ of habeas corpus
will be issued with regard to Slovik’s assault conviction
unless he is retried or resentenced within a reasonable period
of time to be determined by the district court.

FACTS
The defendant was charged by bill of information on June 19, 1999 with DWI, third offense, which occurred on April 17, 1999 in Richland Parish. The bill of information alleged two predicate convictions of DWI:
(1) March 21, 1996: State of Louisiana, Parish of Ouachita, Fourth District Court, and
(2) June 29, 1998: State of Louisiana, Parish of Ouachita, Fourth District Court.
On December 21, 1999, the defendant filed a motion to quash the bill of information, alleging, in pertinent part, that the June 1998 conviction "is constitutionally defective because there is an insufficient inquiry and colloquy between the defendant and the presiding judge."
Parts 4 and 5 of the defendant's motion to quash read as follows:
4.
The transcript of the guilty plea shows that the Trial Judge advised Mover of certain constitutional rights, however, the Trial Judge failed to ascertain:
a) Whether or not the Defendant understood each constitutional right; and
b) Whether or not the Defendant waived each constitutional right.
5.
Mover shows that after the Trial Judge informed Mover of said rights, there was no affirmative showing by Mover, nor was there a response by Mover, that he understood and wanted to waive his constitutional rights.
The evidence submitted, including the court minutes and transcript of the June 1998 guilty plea, shows that the defendant was not represented by counsel while entering his guilty plea. However, the defendant has not challenged the propriety of his waiver of counsel. Thus, the only issue presented for our review is whether the defendant made a knowing and voluntary waiver of his Boykin rights during the 1998 plea colloquy.
*780 The pertinent part of the plea colloquy reads as follows:
Q: Do you understand today's an arraignment session and normally people plead not guilty today and then come back in a couple of two or three months and then they change their plea to guilty. You don't have to plead guilty today or any other day for that matter.
A: No. I want to go ahead and get it behind me.
Q: Alright.
A: That way I can work on it.
* * * *
Q: Okay. You're charged with DWI, driving under revocation, and improper lane usage resulting from a stop back in November. You took the chemical test and your results were .189. And of course if they're higher than .10 then you're presumed to be under the influence. Don't matter if you had two beers or twenty. You're telling me you want to plead guilty to DWI-first offense. You know what that is?
A: Yes, sir.
Q: Operating a motor vehicle on a public highway of this parish and state while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage. By pleading guilty you're giving up your right to a trial before a judge, you're giving up your presumption of innocence, you're giving up the right to subpoena witnesses on your behalf to testify for you if there were any, you're giving up the right to cross-examine the arresting officer that stopped you. It looks like it was a parish deputy ... a sheriff's deputy, Gene Caviness. He and anybody else that might have assisted in the arrest would be summoned to testify. And if you didn't have an attorney, then you could ask the officer questions about why he stopped you and how you did on the field sobriety and all of those other things. By pleading guilty you give up those rights. You give up the right to remain silent. You couldn't be made to testify against yourself. You give up any right to question why the officer stopped you in the first place-probably because of improper lane usage. You might have made a lane change without signalling (sic) or you might have gone back and forth or some other thing that might have given you.
A: I know why he did it.
Q: Why did he do it?
A: On Highway 51 it's got a real sharp curve back to the left. And that improper lane says do not enter.
Q: You crossed over into the other lane?
A: Everybody in the world does it when ... that lives down there in there. But it's just one time I got caught doing it.
Q: Okay. Well, that's a pretty honest way of looking at it. If I determine that there was a good reason for him to stop you, that would be enough for him if he had suspicion that you had been drinking to make you ... ask you to do field sobriety and chemical tests and then the whole bit. Do you understand what the penalty for DWI is? It's going to be a Five Hundred Dollar ($500.00) fine and a sixty ... a hundred and twenty days suspended because this is not a true firstand about ten eight-hour days of community service work, plus going to the same classes that you did the *781 first time. See, that was suppose to be so much of a hassle for you and inconvenience you that you wouldn't want to do this again. But it didn't work though, did it?
A: No, sir.
Q: So you're probably going to have to go into some kind of alcohol treatment program. I'm not saying it has to be a hospital, but it's going to have to be something a little more serious than what you just got through going through because it obviously didn't work. Alright. Any questions?
A: No, sir.
Q: Alright. The next DWI you get hopefully there won't be onebut it could be charged as a third. And that would be a felony and you'd be looking at a minimum of a year in the parish jail, possibly as much as five years in the penitentiary and a Two Thousand dollar ($2,000.00) fine, possibly the seizure and sale of your motor vehicle, the loss of driving privileges for God knows how long. DWIfourth is a very serious felony. That's ten to thirty in the penitentiary. So it gets worse every time it happens. You're lucky you're not being charged as a second offender. Apparently because of when this occurred there was some question about whether or not they could actually process the second offense if you asked for a jury trial. So in any event, you're being allowed to plead. They just charged this as a first. Alright. Any questions?
A: No, sir.
Q: Alright. Are you pleading guilty because you are in fact guilty?
A: Yes, sir.
Q: On or about November 6, 1997, in Ouachita Parish, Louisiana, did you operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage?
A: Yes, sir.
Q: Alright. And I told you what your results were..189.
A: Yes, sir.
Q: That's quite a bit higher than the minimum level of .10.
By the court: Alright. The Court accepts the plea, finds the same to be freely, voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently entered after due advisal of rights by the Court and further finds that he's made an intelligent waiver of his right to counsel knowing the dangers and disadvantages of self representation....
The court minutes for the present case reflect that on May 5, 2000, the defendant introduced the transcripts and minutes of the two predicate DWI offenses into evidence and the trial court took the motion to quash under advisement. The record does not reflect that the trial court made a formal ruling on the motion.
On October 24, 2000, the defendant appeared in open court, with counsel, withdrew his previous plea of not guilty, and entered a plea of guilty pursuant to State v. Crosby, 338 So.2d 584 (La.1976), reserving his right to appeal the use of the June 28, 1998 DWI conviction as a predicate offense for the DWI, third charge. The defendant was sentenced to serve three years at hard labor. This appeal followed.

DISCUSSION
Whenever a misdemeanor guilty plea will be used as a basis for actual imprisonment, enhancement of actual imprisonment or the conversion of a subsequent misdemeanor into a felony, it is incumbent *782 upon the court to inform the defendant that by pleading guilty he waives (a) his privilege against self-incrimination; (b) his right to trial by jury where it is applicable; and (c) his right to confront his accuser. State v. Jones, 404 So.2d 1192 (La.1981); State v. Cadiere, 99-0970 (La.App. 1st Cir.2/18/00), 754 So.2d 294.
What the accused understood is determined in terms of the entire record and not just certain "magic words" used by the trial judge. State v. Strain, 585 So.2d 540 (La.1991). Everything that appears in the record concerning the predicate offense, as well as the trial judge's opportunity to observe the defendant's appearance, demeanor and responses in court, should be considered in determining whether or not a knowing and intelligent waiver of rights occurred. Cadiere, supra; State v. Lodrigue, 97-1718 (La.App. 1st Cir.5/15/98), 712 So.2d 671. Factors bearing on the validity of this determination include the age, education, experience, background, competency, and conduct of the accused, as well as the nature, complexity and seriousness of the charge. Cadiere, supra.
The defendant argues that he was not represented by counsel in the June 1998 guilty plea and although the trial court began to inform him of his three Boykin rights, the trial court made no inquiry or determination that he expressly and knowingly waived those constitutional rights in entering the guilty plea. He further contends that the trial judge must ask a defendant "whether he or she understands his or her rights and wants to give them up."
The state argues that the defendant's rights were explained in simple, straightforward language and that the defendant was given the opportunity to ask questions before he pled guilty. The state further argues that it is clear from the transcript that the trial judge explained to the defendant that by pleading guilty he would be giving up his right to a trial, the presumption of innocence, the privilege against self-incrimination, the right to subpoena witnesses and the right to cross examine the state's witnesses.
The exchange between the trial judge and the defendant during the colloquy gave the judge ample opportunity to observe the defendant's demeanor and conduct. The record shows that the judge advised the defendant of his right to counsel and that he did not have to plead guilty. The defendant responded, "No. I want to go ahead and get it behind me".... "That way I can work on it." The judge and the defendant discussed the defendant's probation stemming from a prior DWI. Also, later in the colloquy, the defendant answered affirmatively when asked whether he wanted to plead guilty to DWI first offense. Finally, the judge informed the defendant that by pleading guilty, he was giving up his right to trial, his privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, and his right to confront his accuser.
After the trial judge informed the defendant of his constitutional rights, the defendant interjected and began to explain to the judge why he believed he was stopped by the officer. Thereafter, the judge explained to the defendant the penalties and consequences of his plea and asked him if he had any questions. The defendant responded, "No Sir." The judge also explained the penalty for a later conviction of a third DWI and then asked the defendant if he had any questions. The defendant again responded, "No Sir."
Although the defendant was not represented by counsel when he entered his guilty plea, the conduct and demeanor of *783 the defendant demonstrated that he understood the proceedings and that he knowingly and intelligently waived his Boykin rights. In fact, the defendant's comments in regard to "getting this matter behind him" and "working on the matter" showed that defendant understood the nature of the charge and was knowingly and voluntarily pleading guilty to the charge. Also, the defendant's explanation of the facts surrounding the June 1998 charge and his discussion with the judge regarding a prior DWI conviction during the colloquy at issue is further evidence that the defendant understood the nature of the proceedings. Moreover, the defendant's rights were explained to him in detail and the trial court gave him numerous opportunities to ask questions. Instead, the defendant continued to express his desire to plead guilty.
The Louisiana Supreme Court has stressed that neither Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969) nor the court's implementation of Boykin in State ex rel. Jackson v. Henderson, 260 La. 90, 255 So.2d 85 (1971), sets out a "magic word formula" which may "serve as a technical trap for conscientious trial judges who conduct a thorough inquiry into the validity of the plea...." State v. Madison, XXXX-XXXX (La.8/31/00), 768 So.2d 593; State v. Bowick, 403 So.2d 673 (La.1981). Here, the judge informed the defendant that by pleading guilty he was "giving up" the right to trial, the right to confront his accusers and the right to remain silent. After being so advised, the defendant stated that he wished to plead guilty. Therefore, in the present case, the absence of the question, "Do you understand?" following the 1998 colloquy does not negate this defendant's guilty plea, where it is clear from the record that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his Boykin rights. The assignment of error lacks merit.

ERRORS PATENT
Pursuant to LSA-C.Cr.P. art. 920, we have reviewed the record for error patent and have found none.

CONCLUSION
For the above reasons, the defendant's conviction and sentence are affirmed.
AFFIRMED.

MALCOMSON ROAD UTILITY DISTRICT, Appellant

V.

FRANK GEORGE NEWSOM, Appellee




On Appeal from the County Civil Court At Law No. 3
Harris County, Texas
Trial Court Cause Nos. 691,631 & 691,632




DISSENTING OPINION ON REHEARING

          I agree with the majority that Hubenak II requires us to apply the summary
judgment standard of review to the trial court’s rulings on each of the statutory
requirements for condemnation, including the unable-to-agree requirement.  Applying
this standard, I agree with the majority that the District conclusively proved that the
parties were unable to agree on damages before the filing of suit.  I also agree that the
District carried its constitutional burden of proving that the taking was for a public
use.  See Tex. Water Code Ann. § 54.201(a), (b)(3) (Vernon Supp. 2004-2005)
(delegating to utility districts power of eminent domain to “gather, conduct, divert,
and control local storm water or other local harmful excesses of water”); Housing
Auth. of the City of Dallas v. Higginbotham, 143 S.W.2d 79, 83 (Tex. 1940)
(legislative determination that project is for public use is binding unless use is
“clearly and palpably” private).  However, because I believe the majority has imposed
an improperly high standard of review on a utility district’s determination of the
necessity of a taking for public use, and has therefore denied the District judgment
to which it is entitled in law, I respectfully dissent.
          As the majority states, a condemning authority’s discretion to condemn land
for a public purpose is nearly absolute, and the courts will not review the exercise of
that authority without a showing that the condemnor acted fraudulently, in bad faith,
or arbitrarily and capriciously.  See Ludewig v. Houston Pipeline Co., 773 S.W.2d
610, 614 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1989, writ denied); Bradford v. Magnolia Pipe
Line Co., 262 S.W.2d 242, 246 (Tex. Civ. App.—Eastland 1953, no writ); Meaney
v. Nueces County Navigation Dist. No. 1, 222 S.W.2d 402, 405 (Tex. Civ. App.—San
Antonio 1949, writ ref’d); Jones v. City of Mineola, 203 S.W.2d 1020, 1022 (Tex.
Civ. App.—Texarkana 1947, writ ref’d).  A condemnation determination is arbitrary
and capricious when it is “willful and unreasoning action, action without
consideration and in disregard of the facts or circumstances [that] existed at the time
condemnation was decided upon, or within the foreseeable future.”  Wagoner v. City
of Arlington, 345 S.W.2d 759, 763 (Tex. Civ. App.—Fort Worth 1961, writ ref’d
n.r.e.).  Thus, to resist summary judgment, Newsom, as condemnee, had the burden
to establish that the condemnation of his property was not for an authorized public
use or was willful and unreasoning and made in disregard of the facts.  As the
majority puts it, “[T]o show that the District acted arbitrarily and capriciously,
Newsom had to negate any reasonable basis for determining what and how much land
to condemn for the pond and the ditch expansion.”  Malcomson Rd. Util. Dist. v.
Newsom, Nos. 01-00-01163-CV & 01-00-01169-CV, slip op. at 22 (Tex.
App.—Houston [1st Dist.] May 20, 2005, no pet. h.); see Wagoner, 345 S.W.2d. at
763 (noting that non-movant landowner could “have raised the issue [of arbitrariness]
only if it was unquestionably established in the evidence that there could have been
no actual public necessity for the [condemning authority] to seek the land in question
for [authorized public] purposes”) (emphasis added).
 
          The majority acknowledges that
[r]egarding the pond, a land planner testified for the District that,
as HCFCD had concluded, a pond was necessary.  Santasiero’s
engineer, Newsom’s engineer, and Newsom’s land planner agreed
that a detention pond was necessary, but did not specify a
location.  HCFCD did not require that the pond be placed on
Newsom’s property, but Ray Zobel, president of the District’s
board, testified that the board selected Newsom’s property for the
pond because that location would have allowed Villagio to have
more homes, thus increasing the tax base more than if Newsom
had been allowed to develop his own land.
 
Regarding the ditch expansion, an engineer and a land
planner testified for the District that, as HCFCD had concluded,
the project was necessary.  Newsom’s own land planner agreed
that HCFCD “would prudently require” the ditch expansion.  The
existing ditch ran along the eastern boundary of Newsom’s
northern tract of land.  The only direction in which the ditch could
be expanded was westward, onto Newsom’s property, because the
land to the east of the ditch had already been developed. 

Malcomson, Nos. 01-00-01163-CV & 01-00-01169-CV, slip op. at 28.  The District
thus presented evidence both that there was an actual necessity for the condemnation
of Newsom’s land for an authorized public use and that there was a reasonable basis
for condemning the land.  Newsom produced no evidence that showed this testimony
to be fraudulent or given in bad faith.
          The majority, however, places a burden on the District to go behind the
evidence showing public necessity and a reasonable basis for the condemnation
decision, to refuse to accept the testimony of persons whose interests are adverse to
the landowner as sufficient, and to require its own engineers to confirm not just the
necessity for the taking—here for the ditch and the pond—but also the necessity of
condemning this ditch and this pond as opposed to any other.  In addition, the
majority imposes the burden on the District to consider and investigate the scope of
the taking, specifically to investigate whether the right-of-way for a drainage ditch
such be taken in fee simple or by easement.  The majority concludes that “the above
evidence raises a fact issue on whether the District declined to exercise its discretion
in determining whose land to condemn for the pond and in deciding whether to
condemn Newsom’s land in easement or in fee for the ditch expansion,” thus raising
a fact issue “on whether the District reached its condemnation decisions arbitrarily
and capriciously or by abusing its discretion.”  Malcomson, Nos. 01-00-01163-CV
& 01-00-01169-CV, slip op. at 31.  I cannot agree.
          First, the majority’s conclusion is not supported by the language of the
governing statute.  There is no requirement in the governing statute, section 49.222(a)
of the Water Code, that the District determine whose land to condemn—only that it
determine on an evidentiary basis that the condemnation is for a public purpose.  See
Tex. Water Code Ann. § 49.222(a) (Vernon 2000).  Nor is there any requirement
that the condemnor investigate whether to condemn land in easement or in fee and
provide evidence for its determination; rather, the power to elect to condemn either
in fee simple or in easement is expressly given to the condemning authority.  See id. 
In both cases, the language of the statute under which the District sought to condemn
Newsom’s property is plain:
A district . . . may acquire by condemnation any land, easements,
or other property inside or outside the district boundaries . . .
necessary for water, sanitary sewer, storm drainage, or flood
drainage or control purposes or for any other of its projects or
purposes, and may elect to condemn either the fee simple title or
a lesser property interest.

Tex. Water Code Ann. § 49.222(a) (emphasis added); see also id. § 49.218(a)-(c)
(Vernon Supp. 2004-2005) (granting districts right to purchase land or interest in land
considered necessary for districts’ purposes).
          Second, the majority’s holding conflicts with established authority. See
Ludewig, 773 S.W.2d at 614–15 (holding landowners’ evidence that condemnor
could have adopted plans circumventing landowners’ property or determined size of
easement differently was no evidence of arbitrary or capricious behavior where there
was reasonable basis for determination); Wagoner, 345 S.W.2d at 763 (holding,
“When the use for which property is sought under authority of the statutes of eminent
domain is an authorized public use, the necessity or expediency of condemning any
particular property is not a subject of judicial cognizance”) (emphasis added);
Meaney, 222 S.W.2d at 408 (holding where district had statutory authority to
condemn fee title, determination whether to take fee rather than easement was
primarily for commissioners; in absence of showing that determination was induced
by fraud or was wholly arbitrary and founded on no adequate determining principal,
district’s decision was final); Hardwicke v. City of Lubbock, 150 S.W.3d 708, 716–17
(Tex. App.—Amarillo 2004, no pet.) (holding where there was room for two opinions
as to necessity of condemning specific properties for redevelopment, action of zoning
authority was not arbitrary and capricious).

          I believe the holding of this court improperly heightens the burden on the
District in establishing the necessity of condemning property for an authorized public
purpose and is contrary to the plain language of the statute the District relied on to
condemn Newsom’s property, section 49.222(a) of the Water Code, and to authority
interpreting the condemnation power.  I also believe that Newsom failed to bear his
burden of proof that the District acted fraudulently, in bad faith, or arbitrarily and
capriciously in condemning a portion of his property.  Therefore, I respectfully
dissent.  I would hold that the District carried its summary judgment burden of
showing the necessity of the taking for an authorized public use and that Newsom
failed to raise a fact issue as to the propriety of the taking.
Conclusion
          I would reverse the district court’s judgment denying the District’s motion for
summary judgment, reverse the judgment granting Newsom’s motion for summary
judgment and awarding him attorney’s fees and possession of the property and
improvements on it, render partial summary judgment for the District, and remand for
further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.

Mrs. Frankie Lou Smith PRICHARD, Independent Executrix ofthe Estate of Houston Smith, Jr., Appellant,v.UNITED STATES of America, Appellee.
No. 23931.
United States Court of Appeals Fifth Circuit.
June 20, 1968.

Melvin M. Diggs, U.S. Atty., Fort Worth, Tex., Mitchell Rogovin, Asst. Atty. Gen., Tax Div., Richard C. Pugh, Act.  Asst. Atty. Gen., Meyer Rothwacks, Lee A. Jackson, Gilbert E. Andrews, Jeanine Jacobs, Attys., Dept. of Justice, Washington, D.C., for appellee.
Before BELL, GODBOLD and DYER, Circuit Judges.
GODBOLD, Circuit Judge:


1
This is an appeal from a judgment that appellant executrix is not entitled to refund of an alleged overpayment of estate tax on the estate of Houston Smith, 255 F.Supp. 552 (N.D.Texas 1966).1  The case concerns application of 2042 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. 2042.  The district court found for the government under sub-sections (1) and (2) of 2042.  We affirm on the basis of sub-section (2), which requires inclusion in the gross estate of proceeds from insurance payable to beneficiaries other than the estate if the decedent possessed at the time of his death any incidents of ownership in the insurance.  This makes unnecessary any discussion of sub-section (1).


2
The decedent, a building contractor, was a resident of Texas, a community property state.  He approached Great Southern Life Insurance Company for permanent mortgage financing on a shopping center which he proposed to construct in Texas.  Great Southern stated as one of its conditions for making the loan that Smith secure from it $250,000 of insurance on his life to be assigned as additional collateral.  Immediately Smith applied for such a policy, on the application showing Great Southern as the proposed beneficiary and owner.  The local Great Southern agent wrote on the application that the insurance was to be assigned to the company if the loan, then pending for approval, was approved.  The company notified Smith it did not wish to be named beneficiary and owner, that an absolute assignment to it would be required.  Mrs. Smith then was named beneficiary and owner.


3
Great Southern issued a commitment letter in a form usual in this type of transaction, committing the company to make a loan of $575,000 to Mr. and Mrs. Smith, secured by mortgage on the real estate and improvements of the shopping center.2  It contained a specific condition requiring that the $250,000 of insurance be absolutely assigned as additional collateral.  Smith paid Great Southern a 'standby fee' of $5,750 for the commitment.  Using the commitment to show that permanent financing had been arranged, Smith obtained interim financing from a bank for construction of the center.


4
Great Southern issued its policy on November 4, 1957 showing as beneficiary the wife if living, otherwise the surviving children of Smith by his said wife.  The policy was ordinary life, with endowment at age 90.  Smith was age 42 at issue.  As part of the policy when issued there was attached a supplemental provision stating:


5
The application for this policy having been made by Houston Smith, Jr., insured, it is understood and agreed that the applicant having designated Frankie Lou Smith-- wife-- as the beneficiary to control this policy, it is understood and agreed that Frankie Lou Smith-- wife-- is the sole owner of this policy and shall have the power to exercise all of the privileges, benefits, rights and options granted to the insured in the policy.


6
The policy was delivered to either Mr. or Mrs. Smith, the record is not clear which.


7
On November 6 Great Southern wired its local loan representative that the leases (to shopping center tenants) had been approved, the loan approved, and the life insurance issued.  Promptly thereafter construction of the center began.  It was built larger than originally planned.  Great Southern agreed to increase its commitment to $615,000 and issued a second commitment letter, making no charges except those necessitated by the new amount and containing a condition that the described $250,000 policy be absolutely assigned as collateral.


8
Under the terms of the policy and assignment of it had to be by Mrs. Smith as owner.  (By other policy terms the right to make policy loans and the right to surrender the policy for its cash value also were in her as owner).


9
The Great Southern loan to the husband-wife community was closed July 7, 1958 when the center was complete.  Necessary papers had been prepared by Great Southern; they included an absolute assignment of the insurance policy, prepared for the signatures of Mr. and Mrs. Smith, which was signed by them at the closing and delivered to Great Southern.  Under the terms of the assignment Great Southern was given a lien upon the policy and the proceeds.3  The rights of the beneficiary were expressly made subordinate to Great Southern's rights under the assignment.


10
On July 15 Smith sent the original policy to Great Southern, which as assignee was entitled to possession of it.  In June, 1959, Great Southern returned the policy to Smith with a form letter saying that it need no longer be held in the company's possession, that the existence of the absolute assignment had been noted on the policy and would be released when the secured indebtedness was retired.


11
Smith was killed in an automobile accident on July 2, 1960.  The unpaid balance on the indebtedness at this time was $565,929.84.  At the request of Mrs. Smith the company agreed to release to her $150,000 of the proceeds of the policy rather than applying all to the secured indebtedness as the company was entitled.  The company stated it was doing this 'in order that it may be of some assistance to you in meeting the taxes that will be assessed against the Estate of your husband.'  The other $100,000 was applied against the debt.


12
Appellant timely filed an estimated tax return.  No portion of the $250,000 policy proceeds was included in the gross estate, but the entire amount of the unpaid indebtedness on the loan at the time of Smith's death was listed as a mortgage debt due Great Southern and was sought to be deducted under 2053(a) (4).  On examination the commissioner included in the estate $125,000, one-half of the policy proceeds, and allowed deduction of one-half the outstanding balance on the mortgage loan.


13
Appellant paid the tax and sued for refund.  From that unsuccessful suit comes this appeal.


14
The statute makes no attempt to define incidents of ownership.  The regulations provide:


15
The term 'incidents of ownership' is not limited in its meaning to ownership of the policy in the technical legal sense.  Generally speaking, the term has reference to the right of the insured or his estate to the economic benefits of the policy.  Thus, it includes the power to change the beneficiary, to surrender or cancel the policy, to assign the policy, to revoke an assignment, to pledge the policy for a loan, or to obtain from the insurer a loan against the surrender value of the policy, etc.


16
Treas.Reg. 20.2042(1)(c).  See generally Lowndes & Kramer, Federal Estate and Gift Taxation 13.6-13.8 (2d ed. 1962).  This court, in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Chase Manhattan Bank, 259 F.2d 231 (5th Cir. 1958), refers to incidents of ownership as the whole bundle of the rights in a policy except the right to the proceeds, including


17
'the economic benefits of the insurance, the cash surrender value, the power to change the beneficiary, the power to surrender or cancel the policy, the power to assign the policy or revoke an assignment, the power to pledge the policy for a loan, the power to obtain from the insurer a loan against the surrender value of the policy.'

Section 2042(2) does not require that the decedent must have retained incidents of ownership in the insurance until his death, only that he possessed incidents of ownership at death.  The language of the statute so provides.  See also Lowndes & Kramer, supra 13.6.4


20
We agree fully with the conclusion of the district court that decedent enjoyed incidents of ownership which required judgment be entered for the government, although our conclusion is based on different grounds.5


21
Under Texas law a conveyance by husband to wife makes the property conveyed the wife's separate property, so that the quantum of Mrs. Smith's ownership of the policy, as a matter of state title law, was complete and sole.  McAdams v. Ogletree, 348 S.W.2d 75 (Tex.Civ.App.1961); Reed v. Reed,283 S.W.2d 311 (Tex.Civ.App.1955).  But we do not close our eyes to the realities.  From the initial statement by Great Southern of what its conditions would be, and up to the time of Smith's death, the insurance policy and the loan were indispensable parts of an integrated transaction.  The negotiations and the course of the loan transaction, the correspondence, and the other documents, admit of only one conclusion.  Although Mrs. Smith was designated as owner we would be wholly unrealistic to conclude anything other than that she was named as owner under the understanding, agreement and arrangement that the policy must be assigned when the community loan was ready to be closed.  The requirement that the policy be obtained and assigned was imposed before application was made for the insurance.  The intent that it be assigned was reported by the agent on the original application, which was before the matter arose of Mrs. Smith's being named owner.  Without an assignment by her there could be no loan to the community, and without the permanent loan the interim lender (who loaned on the faith of the Great Southern commitment for a permanent loan) could not be paid.  There is no evidentiary support for any thesis that Mrs. Smith acted from a donative intent, or was lending collateral to the community, or from any intent other than carrying out the business arrangements which had been made.  There is no evidence that she paid any premium.  While the facts here hardly call for it, we note that we are bound to give effect to substance over form.  Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Court Holding Co., 324 U.S. 331, 65 S.Ct. 707, 89 L.Ed. 981 (1945).


22
Appellant emphasizes that the loan was closed eight months after Mrs. Smith was named owner, that had the loan never been closed the policy would have remained in force so long as the premiums were paid, that had Smith died before the loan was closed the policy would have been the property of Mrs. Smith, and had she died before the loan was closed, her husband surviving, the cash surrender or replacement value of the policy would have been includable in her estate.6  A husband may unconditionally make his wife the owner and beneficiary of an insurance policy on his life when it is issued, or later if he desires, so as to bar inclusion of it in his estate.  Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Estate of Noel, 380 U.S. 678, 85 S.Ct. 1238, 14 L.Ed.2d 159 (1965).  The lapse of eight months, and the rights of the wife during that time, are evidentiary only; they are of little force here, since this was the period during which the center was being built under interim financing which was to be paid off out of the Great Southern loan upon completion.


23
Also appellant seems to contend that as a matter of law there was no incident of ownership in Smith at his death because the assignment had been made two years previously and any power or control that he may have had over the policy had been exhausted when the assignment was executed and delivered.  But the arrangement existed for such a pledge or assignment to be made, and it was made, and the substantial economic benefit to the husband of having the policy stand as collateral for the community debt then commenced and continued up to his death.  Smith's separate property could be liable for the community debt, 30 Tex.Jur.2d 124, and the assigned policy stood between his estate and that possible liability.  (Possibly if his estate were subjected to liability it could seek reimbursement from the community estate, id. 134, but the economic benefit of protective insulation from a possible claim is not dissipated by the hope that if one is without the protection and has to pay he may-- or may not-- ultimately be made whole.)


24
An owner may lend collateral.  Under different circumstances than in this case a wife who has become the absolute owner of an insurance policy on her husband's life, her husband no longer having any incidents of ownership therein, could assign it as collateral for a community debt and the husband would commence enjoying economic benefit from the time the assignment is made.  Whether this alone would bring the policy within the husband's estate is a question for another case.  It is not what happened in this case where in the total transaction there were incidents of ownership at all times, an unconsummated arrangement for eight months followed by the continuing economic benefit of the completed assignment.


25
There was testimony, though somewhat sparse, of the wife that during a period of about six months before discussion of the mortgage with Great Southern she and her husband discussed with various insurance agents the purchase of a large amount of insurance on his life to replace earlier policies which he had dropped; the Smiths felt they might afford the premiums which previously they had been unable to keep up, and the two of them saw in insurance a means of saving for the education of their children.  This too was only evidentiary, and even if these family motivations were present they did not preclude the use of the policy in the manner that was required, arranged for and carried out.


26
Because we affirm under 2042(2) we do not discuss the applicability of 2042(1).

 The commitment was for a 15-year mortgage, and it included conditions of completion of improvements, inspection and acceptance of improvements by Smith and Great Southern and the chief tenants, payment for all labor and material bills, survey, execution of satisfactory leases by tenants, and other normal requirements


3
 In case of default on the mortgage note Great Southern was authorized to make policy loans or surrender the policy and withdraw the cash value, applying to the note proceeds so collected.  If the proceeds became payable as a death claim Great Southern had the right, regardless of whether there had been a default in the note payments, to collect the proceeds, to apply them to any default existing, and, at its option, to apply the remainder to the payment of the last maturing installments owing on the indebtedness although not then due.  Great Southern's rights under the assignment could be exercised without the necessity of resoring to, and without regard to, other security

 The district court described the loan as being to Smith and as contingent on an assignemnt of the policy by him, and referred to the assignment as having been made by him and to his possessing incidents of ownership in making the assignment.  Commitment and loan were to the community, and, under the terms of the policy commitment read together, assignment by the wife as owner was requisite.

A. BACKGROUND


1. Preliminary

The basic remaining issue for determination in this complex litigation is the amount to be awarded to the qui tam relators as their share in the proceeds obtained from the defendants in the settlement of the qui tam Civil Actions 93-5974 (Merena action), 95-6953 (Robinson action) and 95-6551 (Spear action). The Government, with the consent of all of the qui tam relators in the three enumerated actions, settled and dismissed with prejudice all three actions that had been filed by the qui tam relators against the defendants, SmithKline Beecham Corporation and SmithKline Beecham Clinical Laboratories, Inc. (SBCL). The qui tam actions were filed under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. งง 3729-3733. The total amount of the settlement was $325,000,000, plus interest that had accrued on the settlement funds that were deposited in escrow pending final settlement and dismissal of the actions. The accrued interest amounted to $8,976,266.40, making the total recovery $333,976,266.40. The Settlement Agreement expressly provided for dismissal with prejudice of the three above noted qui tam actions, the court retaining jurisdiction over enforcement of the settlement agreement and determination of attorney fees and relators' share issues. Prior to dismissal, the Government expressly and without limitation intervened in each of the actions pursuant to 31 U.S.C. ง 3730(b)(4).
The statute provides that if the Government proceeds with an action brought by an individual under the qui tam statute, the qui tam relator shall "receive at least 15 percent but not more than 25 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement of the claim, depending upon the extent to which the person substantially contributed to the prosecution of the action or settlement of the claim." 31 U.S.C. ง 3730(d)(1). If that section of the statute is applicable, superficially at least, the qui tam relator/relators should be entitled to a minimum of $50,096,439.96 and a maximum of $83,494,066.60.
The separate qui tam relators (hereafter sometimes referred to as the "Consolidated Plaintiffs" or the "Relators") in all three actions have agreed among themselves as to how they will divide any qui tam share awarded to any or all of them. In addition, the Government has agreed with the Spear qui tam Relators to pay those Relators a qui tam award of 15 percent on an allocated share, including interest, of $13,297,829 of the total settlement proceeds. The Government attributes this sum to the separate allegations contained in the Spear complaint. The Merena and Robinson qui tam Relators agree that this allocated share of the proceeds may be deducted from the total settlement proceeds before determining their respective qui tam share or shares. Thus, only the qui tam share or shares to be paid to the Merena and Robinson Relators remains to be decided in this litigation.

2. Basic Contentions of the Parties

The Government contends that in addition to subtracting the amount allocated to the Spear complaint, there also must be subtracted $14,507,107 which was paid out of the total proceeds to various states for losses under the state Medicaid programs resulting from the alleged false claims by *423 SBCL that were included in the settlement.[1]
In addition, the Government contends that the qui tam Relators are entitled to no share of the proceeds recovered for certain so-called "automated chemistry" false claim allegations that were settled. The Government contends that as of the time of the filing of the qui tam actions, the "automated chemistry" allegations were under active investigation by the Government, had been publicly disclosed in the news media, and the qui tam Relators were not "original sources" of the information. The qui tam Relators dispute each of these contentions and assert that they are entitled to a minimum is percent share of the total amount obtained by the settlement including earned interest less the agreed amount allocated to the Spear complaint allegations.
The Government ascribes and allocates the sum of $241,283,471 (including interest) for the so-called "automated chemistry" allegations (see Government's Exhibit G-108), that the Government claims it recovered as a result of its LABSCAM[2] investigation. The Government contends that the qui tam Relators are entitled to no share of that allocated amount. However, because the Merena and Robinson complaints each made allegations that would, at least arguably, be encompassed within the "automated chemistry" allegations that were settled, the Government now seeks to have all of the "automated chemistry" allegations of the complaints in both 93-5974 and 95-6953 dismissed for lack of jurisdiction and/or failure to be the "first to file" the qui tam action under 31 U.S.C. ง 3730(b)(5). The Government seeks presently to have these allegations dismissed even though approximately ten months prior to filing the present motion to dismiss, the Government intervened in both actions without limitation and with the consent of all parties and in conformity with the Settlement Agreement moved the court to enter an order dismissing all three qui tam actions with prejudice. The order was entered on February 24, 1997 (filed document # 33)[3]. No appeal has ever been taken by any of the Merena, Robinson or Spear qui tam Relators, nor has there been any request by any of them to reconsider or to vacate the order of dismissal[4].
The issues appear to be, therefore, (1) determination of the total fund upon which a qui tam award to the Merena and/or Robinson qui tam relators should be based and (2) determination of the percentage of that total to be awarded to the qui tam relators. Sub-issues of (1) above, are: (a) whether the qui tam relators are entitled to any proportionate share of the $14,507,107 distributed to the individual states, (b) whether any of the allegations of the *424 Merena and/or Robinson complaints can and should be dismissed and (c) whether the allocation which the Government assigns to the separate claims is binding on the qui tam relators in determining the total fund upon which they are entitled to receive a proportionate share. In determining the appropriate percentage share, it would appear that this depends, in the words of the statute, solely "upon the extent to which the person [qui tam relator/relators] substantially contributed to the prosecution of the action."

3. History of the Litigation

The three above-captioned qui tam actions were filed under a seal as required by statute by Merena (Civil Action 93-5974), Glenn Grossenbacher and Charles W. Robinson, Jr. ("Robinson") (Civil Action 95-6953), and Kevin J. Spear, The Berkeley Community Law Center, and Jack Dowden ("Spear") (Civil Action 95-6551) (collectively "the Consolidated Plaintiffs")[5]. The Consolidated Plaintiffs brought their respective lawsuits pursuant to the qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. งง 3729-3733. After granting multiple requests by the Government to extend the time for the Government to elect whether to intervene and to retain the seal in these qui tam actions, the Government formally intervened in these cases on September 27, 1996 and took over the litigation pursuant to 31 U.S.C. ง 3730(b)(4)(A), (c)(1), and (c)(2)(A). The Government, prior to formally intervening, negotiated the settlement with SBCL on behalf of itself and the Consolidated Plaintiffs. An agreement in principle was reached by the parties in February, 1996. I issued an agreed upon Order on February 24, 1997, dismissing with prejudice all the claims settled by the Settlement Agreement and Release (filed document # 33). In that Order I retained jurisdiction over, inter alia, enforcement of the Settlement Agreement and determination of the relators qui tam shares, costs and attorney fees.
The settlement funds of $325,000,000 had earlier been placed in a court-supervised interest-bearing escrow account upon the Government's insistence, pending final execution of the Settlement Agreement. While the settlement proceeds were held in the escrow account, they earned interest and the fund grew from $325,000,000 to $333,976,266.40. On February 24, 1997, as requested by the Government, I ordered that the settlement proceeds together with the earned interest be disbursed immediately from the court-supervised escrow account at the CoreStates Bank.[6] After the funds were disbursed from the interest-bearing escrow account, no additional interest has been earned on the settlement proceeds.
On April 1, 1997, I issued an Order directing that, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. *425 ง 3730(c)(2)(B), if necessary, a hearing would be held to determine if the proposed settlement was fair, adequate, and reasonable. Such a hearing would allow any interested party to contest the fairness, adequacy, and/or reasonableness of the settlement. On September 18, 1997, the Government and the Consolidated Plaintiffs filed a Stipulation and Proposed Order (filed document # 61) stipulating their "mutual interest in pursuing discussions regarding settlement of relators' shares of the settlement proceeds under the False Claims Act," and that the parties were in agreement that there was no need to conduct a hearing to determine the fairness, adequacy, and/or reasonableness of the settlement. An Order was entered to reflect this stipulation. The Consolidated Plaintiffs had expressly consented to the terms of the Settlement Agreement and Release, and the formal agreement was signed and dated on September 25, 1996. Neither the Settlement Agreement, the Release nor the Order of February 24, 1997 made any reference to a specific dollar or percentage allocation for any particular claim or claims made by any of the Consolidated Plaintiffs, or sought to quantify any separate Claim or claims beyond the total settlement figure of $325,000,000.
There is no dispute among the Consolidated Plaintiffs as to the fairness, adequacy, and reasonableness of the Settlement Agreement (filed document # 61). As previously noted, the Consolidated Plaintiffs, have agreed among themselves as to how they will divide whatever is awarded as the Relators, qui tam share of the settlement proceeds. What is currently at issue is the exact percentage to be awarded to the Consolidated Plaintiffs and the exact amount of the settlement proceeds upon which that percentage is to be based. At the present time, the only remaining interest SBCL has in this litigation is the issue of attorneys' fees that may be recoverable by Relators against SBCL.[7]
More than six months after the Government and SBCL reached a settlement in principle, and while the Consolidated Plaintiffs complaints remained under a seal, three other plaintiffs (the "Additional Plaintiffs") filed under seal separate qui tam actions pursuant to the "qui tam" provisions of the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. งง 3729-3733. Dr. William St. John LaCorte filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana on April 22, 1996. Jeffrey Scott Clausen filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia on September 3, 1996, and Donald Miller filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida on July 15, 1996. All of these cases were transferred by agreement to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania during 1996 and 1997, and docketed in this court as Civil Actions 96-7768 (LaCorte), 97-1186 (Clausen) and 97-3643 (Miller).
The Additional Plaintiffs filed Memoranda in support of their claims to the settlement proceeds, in which they contended that their claims were settled in the Settlement Agreement reached between the Government and SBCL, and that they, therefore, were entitled to a qui tam share in the $325,000,000 settlement (filed documents # 39, # 40, # 41). The original qui tam plaintiffs (the Consolidated Plaintiffs) filed oppositions to the three Additional Plaintiffs' claims to share in the settlement proceeds (filed documents # 45, # 52). Defendant SBCL took the position that the Settlement Agreement was intended to settle and release all claims asserted in the LaCorte, Clausen, and Miller actions and, in addition, that those actions were barred by the "first-to-file bar" of 31 U.S.C. ง 3730(b)(5) by reason of the Consolidated Plaintiffs' prior filings. The Government contended that three claims raised by LaCorte were not included in the Settlement *426 Agreement and therefore could be separately litigated.[8]
On July 23, 1997, 1 issued a Memorandum and Order dismissing all of Clausen's and Miller's claims, and all but one of LaCorte's claims โ the urinalysis claim โ on the grounds that these claims, in fact, were settled by the Settlement Agreement between the Government and SBCL (filed document # 57). LaCorte's urinalysis claim was severed from his other claims. Equally important, was my conclusion that Clausen, LaCorte and Miller were barred from seeking any portion of the Relators' share of the $325,000,000 settlement, based primarily on the "first to file bar" to intervention under 31 U.S.C. ง 3730(b)(5).
I retained jurisdiction over LaCorte's severed urinalysis claim, over the enforcement of the Corporate integrity agreement, and over the determination of relators, share issues and the issue of attorneys, fees and costs. LaCorte, Clausen and Miller have appealed my dismissal of their claims to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(a)[9]. All three Additional Plaintiffs also filed motions to stay the execution of my Order of July 23, 1997, pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 8(a), pending the outcome of their appeals (filed documents # 60, # 67, # 62). The Consolidated Plaintiffs opposed granting a stay, contending that a stay of the ongoing proceedings would cause "irreparable delay and further harm to the Consolidated Plaintiffs" by possibly reducing the amount of the Relators' share of the settlement proceeds. Further, the Consolidated Plaintiffs argued that none of the Additional Plaintiffs had "posted a bond, the prerequisite for obtaining a stay, in order to compensate the Consolidated Plaintiffs for the lost use of their expected relators' share ... during the lengthy delay occasioned by their appeals" (filed document # 65, Relators' opposition to motions for stay, p. 2). I denied all of the motions for a stay. I held further, that the Consolidated Plaintiffs were free to move at any time for a hearing for the purpose of determining the amount to be awarded to the Consolidated Plaintiffs for their qui tam share/shares (filed document # 80).
The Consolidated Plaintiffs filed a motion to deem interest and/or to segregate settlement funds for the purpose of earning interest (filed documents # 53). Relator LaCorte filed a similar motion (filed document # 66). The Consolidated Plaintiffs and Relator LaCorte argued that at least the statutory minimum of the total settlement proceeds should be set aside in escrow for the purpose of earning interest during the pendency of the litigation. The motion requested the court to segregate, or set aside, twenty-five percent (25%) of the $333,976,266.40 of settlement funds (the maximum that could be awarded under the statute).
The Consolidated Plaintiffs argued in this motion that they were prejudiced by strategic moves by the Government that resulted, and continue to result, in lengthy delays in the disbursement of their relators' shares. As a result of these delays, the Consolidated Plaintiffs claimed that they had lost and were losing use of the money due them and had lost interest they would have earned had the money been deposited into an interest-bearing account at the time of the disbursement from the escrow account. The Consolidated Plaintiffs contended that the Government's strategic *427 move of repeatedly asking for extensions of time to intervene and to extend the seal period in the qui tam actions unduly prejudiced them in that during these delays, the Consolidated Plaintiffs were forced (and continue to be forced) to engage in months of litigation with the Additional Plaintiffs "who filed their qui tam actions during the latter stages of the protracted seal period." (filed document # 53, Motion of Consolidated Plaintiffs to Deem Interest or to Segregate Settlement Funds for the Purpose of Earning Interest, p. 6) The Consolidated Plaintiffs contended that the Government could have and should have promptly raised the first-to-file bar against all potential later-filed qui tam actions including the actions of the three Additional Plaintiffs by intervening in the Consolidated Plaintiffs' actions before the first Additional Plaintiff, LaCorte, filed his suit on April 22, 1996 (after the Government and SBCL had agreed in principle to the settlement). Furthermore, they claimed they were prejudiced by the delays the Additional Plaintiffs caused by way of filing their claims in the first place, and by their subsequent appeals of the dismissals of the Additional Plaintiffs claims. The Consolidated Plaintiffs contended that they have fully complied with the Government's requests throughout the litigation of these cases, including extensions of the period of the sealed filings, and resolving any differences that may have existed among themselves, only to be stonewalled by the Government and the Additional Plaintiffs.[10]
The 25 percent of the total settlement proceeds which the Consolidated Plaintiffs moved the court to segregate represents the maximum percentage, or share, of the proceeds to which they could be entitled under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. ง 3730(d). Although, they conceded that they probably will not be awarded the maximum share, the Consolidated Plaintiffs asserted that setting aside the maximum amount that could be awarded, fully protects the Government. If the Relators' share is ultimately determined to be less than 25 percent, the Government would collect the balance, including accrued interest on the balance (filed document # 53, Motion of Consolidated Plaintiffs to Deem Interest or to Segregate Settlement Funds for the Purpose of Earning Interest, p. 14, n. 2).
In support of its request that the Government be ordered to deposit the settlement proceeds in an interest-bearing account, the Consolidated Plaintiffs alleged that because of the nature of the relationship between qui tam plaintiffs and the Government in qui tam suits, the Government acts as a fiduciary over any settlement proceeds recovered. The settlement proceeds, they argued, can be likened to a trust fund, and by statute, all money held in trust by the Government must be deposited in an interest-bearing account, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. ง 1321 and 31 U.S.C. ง 9702.[11] In an order dated October 28, 1997, I denied these motions on the ground that the Government is not a fiduciary of the settlement proceeds (filed document # 80). The Government neither expressly nor impliedly agreed to act as a fiduciary of these funds. Characterizing the settlement *428 funds as a trust fund is inappropriate. I ruled, therefore, that there is no requirement that the Government deposit the proceeds in an interest-bearing account.
Relator LaCorte moved to sever his urinalysis claim from the remainder of his claim. This motion was granted, and LaCorte, in turn, filed a motion to retransfer the severed urinalysis claim back to the Eastern District of Louisiana (filed document # 81). Citing the pending appeals of the dismissed claims and the possible effect of the outcome of these appeals on the overall litigation, I denied both LaCorte's motion for retransfer (filed document # 98) and his motion for reconsideration of my earlier denial (filed document # 111).
On December 2, 1997, 1 met with the parties in chambers, and the parties agreed informally to a proposed scheduling order. The parties have complied with this informal agreement. Both the relators and the Government have filed in camera proposed procedural orders, but no formal procedural order was issued.
On January 23, 1998, Relator Merena filed a motion for partial summary judgment, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), requesting that judgment be entered for him in the amount of $10,385,412, which is 16 percent (the percentage suggested by the Government as being appropriate) of those settlement proceeds that the Government has conceded should be utilized for purposes of determining the qui tam share based on what the Government contended were the six "Merena only" claims. Merena further argued that entry of partial summary judgment would streamline litigation of the remaining issues (filed document # 110)[12]. Because of the Government's alleged concession on this issue, Merena argued that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact, and that he, therefore, was entitled to a partial judgment as a matter of law.
The Government opposed this motion on the grounds that Merena had placed at issue whether the Government's allocation of the settlement proceeds among the various claims was proper. The Government contended that although it recommended the allocation and award of 16 percent of the settlement proceeds as to the so-called non-LABSCAM or six Merena-specific allegations, Merena's claim for a larger share effectively put the determination of his share at issue. Because of this, the Government argued that there was a genuine dispute as to material facts and therefore the motion for partial summary judgment should be denied.[13]
I issued a Memorandum and Order on February 23, 1998 entering judgment in favor of Relator Merena and against the Government in the amount of $9,736,324, which represents the minimum 15 percent of the $64,908,828 the Government allocated to Merena's six non-LABSCAM claims (filed document # 124)[14]. This judgment was entered without prejudice to the right of any of the Consolidated Plaintiffs, including Merena, to seek and to claim, in this litigation, additional compensation as a qui tam share in the total proceeds of the settlement between the Government and SBCL.


*429 4. Motions for Determination

Currently there are four motions outstanding: 1) the Consolidated Plaintiffs' motion for the determination of relators' share (filed document # 86); 2) the Government's motion with respect to the distribution of settlement proceeds (filed document # 105); 3) the Government's motion to dismiss the Relators' "automated Chemistry" allegations and to dismiss any of the relators' claims to any share of the state recoveries (filed document # 101); and 4) a motion by SBCL regarding attorneys, fees (filed document # 117). The Government filed in camera proposed findings of fact and a reply to the Consolidated Plaintiffs' proposed allocation of the proceeds. The Government also filed a status report regarding discovery (filed document # 118). Both the Government and Relators Merena and Robinson, filed witness lists (filed documents # 115 and # 116). A seven-day evidentiary hearing was held beginning on March 16, 1998, to resolve all of the outstanding motions, including the issue of relators' share.[15] Both the Government and the Relators have filed post-trial motions to support and supplement arguments made in open court during the seven-day hearing.

a. Consolidated Plaintiffs' Motion to Determine Relators' Share

The Relators contend, as they have throughout the litigation, that they are entitled to an award between 15 and 25 percent of the entire proceeds of the settlement and accrued interest. They contend a percentage in excess of the statutory minimum of 15 percent is justified because of their substantial contributions to the investigation as well as the significant risks they have taken in their efforts to supply information to the Government during its investigation. Based on 15 percent of an allocation of $13,297,829 of the settlement fund to the spear Relators those Relators have agreed to settle their claims to a qui tam share. The Merena-Robinson Relators do not contest this award and agree that the $13,297,829 allocation should be deducted from the proceeds in determining their qui tam shares. Specifically, the other Consolidated Plaintiffs, Merena and Robinson, are requesting an award of 18 percent of the total recovery, including interest earned on the escrow account, after deducting the Spear Relator allocation.[16]

b. Government's Motion Regarding the Distribution of Settlement Proceeds

In the Government's motion regarding the distribution of settlement proceeds (filed document # 105), the Government argues that the Relators may not presently raise objections to the Government's allocation of the settlement funds to Relators, specific claims for purposes of determining Relators' share. The Government takes this position because, it argues, the Relators agreed that the terms of the settlement with SBCL were fair, adequate and reasonable, and they knew exactly the allocations utilized by the Government for purposes of the settlement with SBCL. The Government argues that the Relators effectively waived their right to challenge the Government's allocation because they did not challenge the fairness of the Settlement Agreement and, therefore, the Government's allocation of the proceeds between and among the various claims is now binding against the Relators.
The Relators, on the other hand, contend that they were never put on notice that by agreeing to the Settlement Agreement, they were also agreeing to the Government's *430 allocations for purposes of determining the Relators' qui tam share. Their contention is that they agreed to the overall settlement amount and terms, but that the determination of the Relators, share was an issue totally separate and outside the scope of the Settlement Agreement. They contend that they understood that the determination of Relators' share was reserved until after the Government settled the qui tam actions with SBCL. The Government's conduct after the settlement and until just recently supports this understanding, they claim. For example, the Consolidated Plaintiffs cite several instances in which the Government represented to them and to the court that it had not yet determined the allocation of Relators, shares.
The Government contends that for purposes of negotiating the settlement with SBCL, the so-called automated chemistry allegations were valued at $234,798,505. After adding interest earned on the escrow account, that sum amounted to $241,283,471, or approximately 72 percent of the total proceeds including earned interest. (See Government's Motion to Dismiss the Automated Chemistry Allegations, etc., Exhibit # 2, filed document # 101). In addition, the Government allocated $14,507,107 with interest included for payment to various states as their "Medicaid share" of the settlement. The Government contends that these two sums, i.e., the $241,283,471 (automated chemistry) and the $14,507,107 (states Medicaid proceeds) plus the $13,297,829 agreed allocation to the Spear Relators must be deducted from the total proceeds for purposes of determining the Relators' share. Therefore, based on total proceeds of $333,976,266.40, the Government contends that Relator Merena is entitled to a qui tam share of $10,385,412, which represents 16 percent of the net balance of $64,908,828[17] allocated by the Government's calculations to the "Merena non-LABSCAM" allegations.[18] The Government alternatively contends that the Consolidated Plaintiffs, at most, are entitled to no more than 10 percent of the recovery for the Relator's automated chemistry claims.

c. Motion to Dismiss Relators An to the "Automated Chemistry" Claims

The Government has moved to dismiss all of the so-called "automated Chemistry" allegations of the Relators, complaints pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, 12(b)(1) as to whichever Relator the court deems to have been the "first to file" the automated chemistry allegations settled between the Government and SBCL under 31 U.S.C. ง 3730(b)(5)[19].
First, the Government seeks to bar Relators from any share in the recovery for the automated chemistry claims, pursuant to the jurisdictional bar in 31 U.S.C. ง 3730(e)(4), because of allegedly widespread public disclosures of the automated chemistry allegations against SBCL and the Government's ongoing investigation of SBCL prior to any Relator filing a qui tam action.
The Government argues that the Relators' complaints are jurisdictionally barred as to any "automated chemistry" allegations because the investigation into these claims commenced by the Government prior to, and independent of, any contact with *431 the Relators.[20] Specifically, the Government argues that because of the high-profile media coverage of the investigation into the automated chemistry claims prior to the Relators, filing their qui tam actions, the Relators' claims are jurisdictionally barred pursuant to the False Claims Act's public disclosure bar. 31 U.S.C. ง 3730(e)(4)(A). The Government's argument is that the Government was already aware of SBCL's illegal conduct and was in the process of investigating this conduct as part of its ongoing LABSCAM Task Force investigation before any of the Relators came forth with any information. Moreover, the Government points out that, prior to the filing of any of these qui tam actions, there were articles in the New York Times and various industry publications, as well as an expose on a CBS television broadcast of the show 60 Minutes on September 19, 1993, entitled "Blood Money," concerning the filing of false claims by three medical laboratories including SBCL.[21]
Second, the Government seeks to bar Relator Robinson and others because of the first-to-file bar rule in 31 U.S.C. ง 3730(b)(5). The Government argues that upon the court's determination of which Relator was the first to file an automated chemistry claim, the later filing Relators are barred from making any automated Chemistry claims because no person other than the Government may intervene in a qui tam action or "bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action." 31 U.S.C. ง 3730(b)(5).
In the alternative, the Government contends that even if the court had jurisdiction over the qui tam plaintiffs' automated chemistry claims, the Relators would still only be entitled to a relator's share in the range of zero to ten percent of the recovery allocated to the automated chemistry claims. It is the Government's contention that no Relator qualifies as an "original source" as to the automated chemistry allegations, but that even if a Relator was an original source, the qui tam share should be limited to a low percentage in the zero to ten percent range category for the amount of the proceeds allocated to the automated chemistry claims.
In response to the Government's motion, the Merena-Robinson Relators contend that 31 U.S.C. ง 3730(e)(4) "does not divest the court's jurisdiction over `parties' ... but instead over the entire action." (filed document # 113, Reply of Relators to Government's Motion to Dismiss Automated Chemistry Allegation, p. 16). Therefore, they argue, when the Government intervened in the actions, it "assured the court's jurisdiction over the Relators' `actions.'" (filed document # 113, Reply of Relators to Government's Motion to Dismiss Automated Chemistry Allegation, p. 16). By intervening, the Relators contend, the Government "establishes subject matter jurisdiction, whether or not, absent intervention, the Court would have had jurisdiction over the Relators." (filed document # 113, Reply of Relators to Government's Motion to Dismiss Automated Chemistry Allegation, p. 14).
The Relators contend that they are not jurisdictionally barred by the statute because none of the so-called public disclosures the Government references actually disclose the "allegations or transactions" of SBCL's fraud schemes as alleged in their respective qui tam actions and their actions were not based upon any public disclosures. The Relators allege that they were the original voluntary sources of the *432 information upon which their respective qui tam actions were based, including the so-called "automated chemistry" allegations. They contend that they had personal, direct and independent knowledge upon which they based all of their allegations. They contend that none of their claims or allegations were based upon or derived from already publicly disclosed information, but were all made upon their individual firsthand personal knowledge. The Relators assert, further, that because there was no public disclosure of their particularized claims or of the allegations or transactions upon which their actions were based including the automated chemistry claims, there is no issue as to whether they were an original source.
The Government requests, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) that the court dismiss the Relators' claims to a share of the state portion of Medicaid funds recovered by forty-three states from SBCL as a part of the overall settlement.[22] The $14,507,107 that was paid to the states was deducted from the total $325,000,000 plus accrued interest that the Government received. The Government argues that these state funds were not recovered under the federal False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. งง 3729-3733, and, therefore, the Relators are not entitled to a share of these state settlement proceeds. The Government claims that the federal statute does not entitle the Relators to any share of the state proceeds. Because these proceeds were paid directly by SBCL to the states and not to the Government, the Government contends it never had or received this money, and it is now the Relators' burden to deal directly with the states if they believe they are entitled to some portion of the "Medicaid" recoveries paid to the states.
It is the Relators' contention that they are entitled to a percentage share in the total "proceeds of the action or settlement of the claim," 31 U.S.C. ง 3730(d)(1), including that portion "unilaterally diverted to forty-three states." (filed document # 113, Reply of Relators to Government's Motion to Dismiss Automated Chemistry Allegation, p. 140). Therefore, Relators contend that the amounts paid to the states should not be deducted from the total fund of money from which their Relators' share should be calculated.
Despite the argument that the Relators should share less than the 15 percent statutory minimum on the "automated chemistry" claims, it appears that the Government concedes that Relator Merena is entitled to a qui tam share in the 15 to 25 percent range of all proceeds recovered based on Merena's "non-automated allegations" or his "new allegations." The total recovery for these new allegations has been valued by the Government at $64,908,828, including pro-rated earned interest. The Government suggests that an appropriate percentage for these non-automated chemistry claims should be 16 percent. Therefore, the total maximum recovery the Government contends Relators Merena and Robinson are entitled to receive would be $10,385,412.48.
The Relators differ with the Government in three major respects. First, they place a higher value on "the extent to which they substantially contributed to the prosecution of the actions." 31 U.S.C. ง 3730(d)(1). They claim that their Relators' share should be at least IS percent rather than 16 percent as suggested by the Government. Second, they contend that they are entitled to at least 18 percent of the total settlement fund, including the automated chemistry claims and the money paid to the states as part of the Settlement Agreement, less the $13,297,829 allocated for the Spear Relators, regardless of how the funds were allocated by the Government for the purposes of negotiating a settlement with SBCL or distributed *433 among the various federal and state agencies. Third, they contend that they are not, and cannot now, be jurisdictionally barred by the public disclosure bar and that they should not be limited to recovery on only the non-automated chemistry claims.

d. Motion of SBCL in regard to Attorney Fees and Costs

SBCL has advised that it has agreed to the amount of attorney fees and costs it will pay to Relator Merena, in Civil Action 95-6953. SBCL contends that it should not be required to pay any counsel fees or costs to the Robinson Relators in Civil Action 95-6953 or to the Spear Relators in Civil Action 95-6551, largely because of the "first to file law." However, all three civil actions, 93-5974, 95-6953 and 95-6551 were settled and dismissed with prejudice by agreement of all parties. The settlement expressly settled all claims asserted in the three qui tam actions and certain other additional claims as set forth in the Settlement Agreement and Release for $325,000,000. There was no allocation of the proceeds between or among the qui tam actions, or among the various claims. There was no motion filed by any party prior to the dismissal of the actions challenging the court's jurisdiction over any or all of the claims, nor any motion to dismiss any claim or claims. For this reason, it would appear that reasonable attorney fees and reasonable expenses necessarily incurred and costs should be awarded to the qui tam Relator in each of the three actions.

B. DISCUSSION


1. Irrelevant Considerations.

Before discussing the discrete legal and factual issues, several arguments advanced by one or more of the parties to this litigation may be briefly set aside.
Relator Merena, and perhaps other Relators, argue extensively as to the risk and hazard to their respective occupational reputations and future employment prospects, as well as to the disruption of their family life by reason of being "whistleblowers." Nothing in the statute remotely suggests that these are appropriate Considerations in determining the amount or proportionate share to be awarded qui tam relators. 31 U.S.C. ง 3730(d)(1) sets forth as the only guideline for the 15 to 25 percent range "the extent to which the person substantially contributed to the prosecution of the action or settlement of the claim," and, as to the "not more than 10 percent" range (if applicable), "the significance of the information and the role of the person bringing the action in advancing the case to litigation." The two tests, one for the 15 to 25 percent range and the other for the "not more than 10 percent" range appear to be essentially the same; namely, the extent to which the qui tam relator's information and assistance helped the successful prosecution and, in this case, settlement of the case. Apparently, Congress concluded that the proportionate share of the proceeds established by the statute was an adequate incentive and compensation to a qui tam relator for the economic and personal risks in filing a qui tam action, and that the primary guideline for the percentage to be awarded should be the aid and assistance the information provides toward the ultimate conclusion of the case.
The extensive arguments presented by both the Relators and the Government as to the Government's treatment of qui tam Relators in other actions in which a qui tam percentage share was awarded and/or paid by the Government, whether voluntarily by agreement or after litigation, would appear to have no relevance to the present issues except possibly as some precedence as to what might be an appropriate percentage in this case.
The Government, in various of its briefs and filings seems to argue that because of the ongoing LABSCAM investigation, the investigation of SBCL would have ultimately proved just as successful as the *434 investigation of NHL, at least as to the automated chemistry claims, without the aid and assistance of the Relators, and therefore, that the Relators are somehow barred from any recovery as to those claims. I find nothing in the statute that states or suggests that merely because the Government is carrying out an investigation, a qui tam action is barred. The necessary element under the statute is not an investigation but rather public disclosure. Government investigations are ordinarily not publicly disclosed until they are completed. Merely because a qui tam complaint may make allegations that correspond with or parallel allegations that a Government agency may be investigating, the qui tam action is not barred, nor is the qui tam Relator precluded from an appropriate statutory share of any resulting recovery.
The Government has also made some suggestions that because there was a very large recovery against SBCL[23], the percentage awarded should be on the lower rather than on the higher end of the appropriate statutory range. There is nothing in the statute to suggest that the amount of the total recovery is, or should be, an appropriate consideration in determining the percentage range or in calculating the total qui tam award. Had Congress intended the amount of the award to be a relevant factor in establishing the percentage of the recovery, it could have simply enumerated this as a relevant factor to be considered, or Congress could have directed a sliding scale of percentages depending on the dollar amount of the recovery. Obviously, Congress had to be well aware that a qui tam Relator could indeed recover a very large sum of money as a qui tam award if the civil recovery that Government obtained from the defendant was also very large. Therefore, I do not consider the amount of the total settlement to be a relevant factor in determining what percentage of the recovery should be paid to a qui tam relator.
Finally, both the Government and the Relators argued extensively about matters occurring after the date of the settlement, which for the purpose of deciding the qui tam Relators, share would be, at the latest, the date of the dismissal of the actions on February 24, 1997. The extent, if any, to which the Relators may have assisted or cooperated with the Government in any ongoing or further investigation seems to me to be wholly outside the scope of inquiry in determining the percentage and amount of the award to go to the qui tam Relators for their assistance in bringing about the settlement and the termination of these actions.

2. Justiciability of the percentage range

The statute makes no specific reference as to the procedure to be utilized in determining what percentage, within the statutory 15 to 25 percent range, should be awarded a qui tam Relator, nor does the statute expressly provide that the issue of the appropriate percentage is a matter to be decided by the courts in the absence of an agreement between the Government and the Relators.
In several sections the statute makes explicit that certain issues are subject to a court hearing, and, therefore by inference, subject to a court decision. As examples of such clearly justiciable issues are: (1) dismissal or settlement of qui tam actions by the Government over the objection by relators (31 U.S.C. ง 3730(c)(2)(A) (dismissal) and (B) (settlement); (2) limiting the litigation participation of a qui tam relator when the Government proceeds with the action, 31 U.S.C. ง 3730(c)(2)(C) and (D); (3) permitting the Government to intervene at a later date upon a showing of "good cause," (31 U.S.C. ง 3730(c)(3); (4) staying discovery on the application of the *435 Government (31 U.S.C. ง 3730(c)(4); (5) an award in the zero to ten percent range โ "the Court may award such sum as it considers appropriate" โ (31 U.S.C. ง 3730(d)(1)).
Curiously, the statute says nothing as to whether a court in a judicial proceeding may determine what percentage between the 15 and 25 percent range, where applicable, should be awarded. Having expressly provided for court decision as to some issues, but no mention as to the 15 to 25 percent range, it could be argued that the actual percentage is a matter committed solely to executive (prosecution) branch discretion, reviewable, possibly, only for an abuse of governmental discretion.
None of the parties to this litigation have contended that the court may not decide what percentage should be awarded. Case law, without discussing or mentioning the justiciable issue suggests that when the parties cannot agree as to the proper percentage, the matter is appropriate for court judicial decision,[24] to determine "the extent to which the person [qui tam Relator] substantially contributed to the prosecution of the action" (15 to 25 percent range) and "the significance of the information and the role of the person bringing the action in advancing the case to litigation." 31 U.S.C. ง 3730(d)(1).
I will proceed to first decide the justiciable issues, namely (1) the motion to dismiss the "automated chemistry" claims in Civil Actions 93-5974 and 95-6953; (2) the amount of the proceeds upon which the qui tam percentage award will be based; i.e., whether the state Medicaid recoveries of $14,507,107 should first be deducted from the fund upon which the percentage is calculated; (3) whether the allocations as to separate claims, including the Medicaid, the "automated chemistry" and the other "non-Merena only" claims utilized by the Government in negotiating the settlement with SBCL are binding on the qui tam Relators in determining their qui tam share; (4) whether the 15 to 25 percent range or the zero to ten percent range should be applied to the whole or to separate portions of the claims. Finally, assuming that establishing the actual percentage or percentages are justiciable, the percentage or percentages that should be applied will be decided and judgment will be entered for the amount of the qui tam award.

3. Dismissal of the "Automated Chemistry" Claims

The complaints in both Civil Actions 93-5974 and 95-6953 seem clearly to allege all of the so-called "automated chemistry" claims. The Government apparently concedes this and, for that reason, in order to prevent qui tam Relators from sharing any percentage of any recovery attributable properly to those claims, seeks to have those portions of the qui tam complaints dismissed.
I find no case that remotely suggests that a district court could now dismiss any of the particular claims made in any of the three qui tam complaints. To begin, all three qui tam complaints were dismissed, with prejudice, including all claims set forth in the complaints, upon the motion of the Government and with the joinder of qui tam Relators and SBCL. I retained jurisdiction over only enforcing the settlement agreement and determining the qui tam shares to be awarded out of the settlement and attorneys fees and Costs and expenses to be assessed against SBCL in favor of the qui tam Relators. Although not directly applicable, the case of Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Insurance Company of America, 511 U.S. 375, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994) makes it apparent, at least to me, that when a *436 case is finally dismissed with prejudice, the court loses all jurisdiction except to the extent that jurisdiction is expressly retained in the order of dismissal.
The Government seeks to have Relator Merena's automated chemistry allegations dismissed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) for failure to plead fraud as to those allegations with sufficient specificity. How or why this should be done at this time, long after the case was settled and dismissed with prejudice in its entirety is not explained. Even if a timely motion had been made, and granted, undoubtedly the plaintiff would have been afforded an opportunity to replead and specify in detail. I consider this argument by the Government to be frivolous. This assertion by the Government is perhaps one of the reasons why the qui tam Relators feel forced to argue that the Government is trying in every conceivable way possible to defeat their respective claims for the qui tam share that they believe they are entitled to receive under the law. To the extent that the Government is asking this court to dismiss Relator Merena's automated chemistry Claims for failure to specifically allege fraud, the motion will be denied.
The Government's primary contention as to both Merena and Robinson's automated chemistry Claims is that these claims should be dismissed from both of the qui tam complaints because of lack of subject matter jurisdiction, pursuant to the bar of 31 U.S.C. ง 3730(e)(4)(A). The qui tam actions, including all claims asserted therein have already been dismissed with prejudice. They do not have to be re-dismissed. Perhaps of even more importance, the Government does not contend that the court lacked jurisdiction over the actions, but merely certain of the claims alleged in each of the actions.
The qui tam Relators contend that their automated chemistry claims were not "based upon" any public disclosures or obtained or copied from news reports or media, but were based upon their personal knowledge and information and that they were, in any event, "original sources" within the meaning of the statute 31 U.S.C. ง 3730(e)(4)(B). They also contend that irrespective of whether their respective actions, as to some of the claims might have been subject to dismissal under 31 U.S.C. ง 3730(e)(4)(A) and (B), no motion to do so was ever made, and upon the Government formally intervening in the action, the question of the court having subject matter jurisdiction was mooted. I agree.
On the motion to dismiss the automated chemistry claims, I conclude that the motion will be denied. In doing this, I do not decide whether those claims could have been barred because of preexisting public disclosures and whether either of the Relators were "original sources" if the motions had been made before the dismissals.
Even if the "automated chemistry" claims could have been, or may even now be subject to dismissal, this would not necessarily preclude the qui tam Relators from sharing within the 15 to 25 percent range on the "proceeds of the action or settlement of the claim." Where a qui tam action is filed, and the Government intervenes and expands the allegations of the complaint, or settles the action, including broader Claims than alleged in the qui tam action, this should not preclude the qui tam relator from receiving the minimum statutory qui tam share of 15 percent of the entire settlement, as well as a percentage above the 15 percent minimum up to the maximum of 25 percent "depending upon the extent to which the person [qui tam Relator] substantially contributed to the prosecution of the action."

4. Allocation of Values to Specific Claims

The denial of the Government's motion to dismiss all of the automated chemistry claims contained in the qui tam Relators' complaints does not necessarily mean that the Relators are entitled to a share in the 15 to 25 percent range, or indeed even in *437 the "not more than 10 percent" range. The Government contends that the court must consider the actions of the Relators on a claim by claim basis irrespective of whether the automated chemistry allegations are dismissed. As to those claims in which there was prior public disclosure and the Relators were not "original sources", the Government argues that the Relators are entitled to no qui tam share of the proceeds.
The qui tam statute involved makes no mention of treating a qui tam complaint as having distinct and divisible claims for the purpose of determining the qui tam Relator's share of the proceeds. The statute provides that where the Government intervenes and proceeds with the action, as it did in these cases, the qui tam Relator shall "receive at least 15 percent but not more than 25 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement of the claim." (Underlining added). The statute speaks of the action and claim as a single unit or whole entity. It would seem almost inevitable to me that at least in most qui tam actions there would be allegations of multiple false claims alleged in a complaint. The qui tam actions involved here were settled as to all claims, whether or not validly pled or substantively valid, for a single overall sum of money. In determining the portion to be paid to qui tam Relators, I do not think the statute ever contemplated that a court should, after the fact of settlement, consider each separate claim to determine whether the claim was subject to dismissal because of pre-filing public disclosures and/or whether the Relators were an "original source." The Government never sought to have any of the Relators' qui tam allegations dismissed prior to entry of the order settling and dismissing each of the actions with prejudice. Neither did it ever seek leave to file an amended complaint, as it undoubtedly had the right to do.
Far more important, at least to me, is that in all three of the qui tam actions, the Government intervened, and settled with SBCL (with the consent of the Relators) for an overall settlement sum of $325,000,000. The signed Settlement Agreement and the executed Releases designated no monetary allocation or division among various claims, other than mention that the settlement included all enumerated claims by various Governmental agencies, and by the separate state claims for their respective Medicaid losses. Neither did the Settlement Agreement, the Releases or anything else filed of record seek to allocate or quantify a dollar amount between or among the three qui tam actions or the separate claims of each action.
The evidence is specific and clear that although the Government, in determining the reasonableness and adequacy of the overall settlement, evaluated the monetary value of certain distinct claims, the settlement between the Government and SBCL was an arbitrary "bottom line" figure of $325,000,000 for all of the claims that were set forth in the Settlement Agreement through the date of September 16, 1996. The settlement expressly included all of the claims set forth in the three qui tam actions and all claims for the states' Medicaid losses. SBCL certainly did not settle the qui tam actions or any specific claim or claims asserted therein for any specific sum other than the overall figure of $325,000,000.
Even if the court should consider the qui tam shares on a claim by claim basis, because the only quantified amount is the overall settlement of $325,000,000, it seems to me that, at the least, the Government would have the burden of proof to establish such allocation of the settlement proceeds it seeks to have the court make. The Government apparently contends that it has fully established this and met any burden of proof that it may have, because prior to the settlement being approved, the Government submitted to the Relators its proposed allocations that it would present to SBCL for the purpose of concluding settlement negotiations. The evidence is clear however, that no representative of *438 the Government ever informed any of the Relators that the Government would contend that these calculations would be binding on Relators in determining their respective qui tam shares. Neither did the Government ever inform any of the Relators that if the matter of the qui tam shares would ever be litigated, the Government would contend that the Relators had waived any right to contest such allocations because they had agreed to the overall settlement with SBCL with knowledge of the allocations assigned by the Government for purposes of negotiating the settlement.
To the extent that a finding on waiver is necessary or appropriate, I find as a fact that the Government's position that the Relators must accept and are bound by the Government's allocation was never expressed to the Relators prior to their agreeing to the settlement. Even in Court filings and representations to the court, long after the settlement was approved, and while the issues of the Additional Plaintiffs' right to share in the proceeds as qui tam relators was being litigated, the Government repeatedly stated that it had not yet calculated or determined what amount it would offer to the qui tam Relators, either individually or in total.
I find the Government's position that the Relators, by not objecting to the overall settlement somehow waived their right to challenge the Government's assigned allocations of proceeds to particular claims to be unacceptable. So far as the evidence discloses the allocations were unilaterally set by the Government. They were never expressly agreed to by any party, including SBCL. The Government now contends that not only the Relators, but also the court, must accept at face value those allocations. The Government used the allocations of proceeds among claims solely for purposes of negotiating a settlement and to calculate distribution of the proceeds among the various affected governmental agencies.
There is absolutely no evidence on the record before me, beyond the unacceptable waiver argument, to establish any allocation among various claims. The Relators repeatedly sought explanation from the Government, both informally and in discovery, as to the Government's allocation calculations. The Government's only response is, and always has been, that the calculations were based on rational estimates of losses and complex negotiations among the various governmental agencies and that the parties and the court are bound to accept the Government's calculations. It seems to me to be almost a "trust us, we are not wrong, we are correct" attitude. The Government tries, at a minimum, to require Relators to prove the allocations are in error without providing Relators with any discovery on the issue, although such discovery was requested. This I cannot accept.
I conclude on this issue, that the Relators are not bound by the allocations assigned by the Government as to the automated chemistry, the "new Merena-only" and the Spear qui tam allegations. It is the Government that attempts to reduce the individual and total qui tam award shares by assigning particular values to various claims. Even if dividing the proceeds among separate claims would be appropriate, there is no evidence upon which a fact-finder could rationally make such a determination on the record before me. All parties were provided with a full opportunity to develop the record on all issues.
In determining the qui tam share or shares to be paid to the Relators, the claims may not be allocated for dollar amounts between or among the automated chemistry, the "new Merena only" and other claims. First, neither the Settlement Agreement, the Release nor any statement or document on record at the time of the approval of the settlement ever mentioned any separate sum of money other than the $325,000,000. Second, the statute makes no suggestion that a qui tam award should be based on a claim by claim basis to *439 determine which claims are valid or what the individual monetary worth of separate claims were to the overall settlement. The percentage of the award above the minimum is to be based upon the extent to which the qui tam Relator substantially contributed to the prosecution of the action. Third, Relators did not waive their right to contest any governmental allocations of proceeds to particular claims. Finally, there is no basis in the evidence upon which a monetary allocation among claims could rationally be made.

5. Medicaid Fraud Payments Made to 42 States and the District of Columbia

The February 24, 1997 order of distribution from the escrow account directed that "$14,460,124.01 be distributed into the National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units, for further distribution to the states with which SBCL had settled." The total amount of net proceeds recovered by the Government was $319,469,159 ($333,976,266 less $14,507,107).[25]
The evidence discloses that 42 states and the District of Columbia, who had made Medicaid payments under their respective state programs to SBCL, negotiated separate settlements with SBCL. Because SBCL sought a "global settlement" for the alleged billing fraud claims, the amount to be paid to the states was factored into the overall $325,000,000 settlement. It is clear that the Government never received and never intended to receive the full $325,000,000. All parties were well aware of this. Although there is no direct mention of separate payment amounts to the state Medicaid Fraud Control Units in the Settlement Agreement or the Release, the fact that the states were simultaneously settling their claims was expressly set forth in the Settlement Agreement. Preamble G of the Settlement Agreement specifically refers to the submission of Claims for payment by SBCL to the Medicaid programs of the expressly enumerated 42 states and the District of Columbia. Preamble Q, however, specifies that the Government contends that all of the alleged fraudulent payments, including the Medicaid program payments to the states constituted submission of false claims under the Federal False Claims Act. Paragraph 4 of the Settlement Agreement refers to "receipt of the payment described in Paragraph 1 above [$325,000,000] by the United States and the State Settlement Account, collectively." Paragraph 6 of the Settlement Agreement provides that the Relators (all of whom signed the Settlement Agreement) "will release, upon receipt of the payment described in Paragraph 1 above by the United States and the State Settlement Account, collectively, in accordance with the Court Order, SBCL...." Consequently, it is clear that the Relators were well aware that payment would be made directly to the enumerated states out of the total $325,000,000 settlement recovery. They knew, at least when the order of distribution was entered, if not before, the exact amount that was to be paid to the states.
I do not agree, however, with what I understand is the Government's present position, that a federal cause of action under the False Claims Act for the payments to the states for their share of the Medicaid payments, could not be maintained. That is inconsistent with the Government's contentions set forth in Preamble Q to the Settlement Agreement cited above.
Medicaid programs, although authorized by federal law and supported by federal contributions to the states, are not strictly federal government programs. They are state programs authorized and partially financed by federal law. A false claim *440 submitted to and paid by a state's Medicaid program indirectly results in a loss to the federal government, but it is not strictly speaking, a false claim submitted to the United States. A qui tam share may be obtained from the Government only out of the proceeds of the settlement received by the Government. The Government's net recovery was, as above noted, $319,469,159. That is the total proceeds upon which the qui tam shares will be determined.
I recognize that this determination is arguably inconsistent with the determination that the various claims against SBCL set forth in the qui tam complaints may not be subdivided and quantified as to amounts. The amounts that were paid to the states under the Medicaid programs are definite and they were incorporated in an order of court. They were funds that the Government never received and never were entitled to receive. The amounts paid to the states were negotiated separately and separate agreements and releases were signed by each of the effected states and SBCL.
I note that the Government, the Relators and SBCL entered into a stipulation, prior to the Relators agreeing to the settlement, that both the Government and the Relators reserved the right to contend, "that funds paid to any state are or are not subject to any claim for a relator's share." As to this issue, it appears that the Government's present position comes as no surprise to the Relators.
The Relators Contend that they are entitled to a qui tam share of that portion of the proceeds received by the states, because, in the words of the Relators, those payments were made as "a unilateral determination of the Government." I disagree with that characterization. The qui tam award that will be made will be calculated on the total proceeds received by the Government, after deducting the amount received by the states.

6. The "no more than 10 per cent qui tam share" issue

The most perplexing issue under the statute is whether the "no more than ten percent of the recovery" award is applicable. Neither the Relators nor the Government were clear as to their respective interpretations of this section of the statute.
31 U.S.C. ง 3730(d) provides in relevant part:
(d) Award to Qui Tam plaintiff. โ (1) If the Government proceeds with an action under subsection (b), [as it did in this case] such person shall, subject to the second sentence of this paragraph, receive at least 15 percent but not more than 25 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement of the Claim, depending upon the extent to which the person substantially contributed to the prosecution of the action. Where the action is one which the court finds to be based primarily on disclosures of specific information (other than information provided by the person bringing the action) relating to allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or Government Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, the court may award such sums as it considers appropriate, but in no case more than 10 percent of the proceeds, taking into account the significance of the information and the role of the person bringing the action in advancing the case to litigation.
The problem arises, because the statute in almost identical language in sub-section (e)(4)(A) provides that unless the qui tam Relator is an "original source", as expressly defined in the statute, "no court shall have jurisdiction over" a qui tam action that is "based upon public disclosures" of the same type that triggers the "no more than 10 percent" award provision. The Government has argued that sub-section (e)(4)(A) forecloses both the Merena and Robinson Relators from any award on the *441 automated chemistry allegations and alternatively, but I believe inconsistently, alleges that sub-section (d), quoted above, limits any award on the automated chemistry allegations to the "no more than 10 percent" range, and suggests that the percentage should be in the low range between zero and ten percent.
Arguably, the "no more than 10 percent" award could apply in every case, if the court makes the finding that "the action [not specific allegations of the action] is based primarily on disclosures of specific information" (underlining added) of the type therein defined. The Government, in argument, suggested that the distinction between the two apparently conflicting sections, is that the "no more than 10 percent" subsection specifies "disclosures", whereas the jurisdictional bar sub-section refers to "public disclosures". I do not think this distinction is valid, because, for example, there could hardly be a disclosure "from the news media" that was not a public disclosure. To the extent that the Government suggests that there might be a non-public disclosure to the Government by some inter-governmental investigation, allowing a recovery of no more than 10 percent, the statute can not be reasonably so interpreted. One of the clearly enunciated purposes of the most recent 1986 amendments to the statute, was to prevent the harsh preclusive effect of mere governmental knowledge or investigation as occurred in United States ex rel, Wisconsin v. Dean, 729 F.2d 1100 (7th Cir.1984). See United States ex rel, Stinson v. Prudential Insurance Company, 944 F.2d 1149, 1163 (3d Cir.1991) (Scirica, J., dissenting).
The Relators explanation of the "no more than ten percent" clause in sub-section (d) appears to be that where an action would be subject to dismissal for lack of jurisdiction under the public disclosure bar, sub-section (e)(4)(A) and (B), but the Government nevertheless intervenes, the Relator would then be entitled to a percentage up to ten percent "taking into account the significance of the information and the role of the person bringing the action in advancing the case to litigation." Relators further contend that the jurisdictional "public disclosure" bar and the "original source" exception have no application once the Government intervenes. This is a plausible explanation for the seemingly contradictory clauses of the statute.
The Relators contend, as they have throughout this litigation, that, it any event the "public disclosure bar" has no application to their qui tam actions. Factually, they contest vehemently the nature of any public disclosures, including the broadcast in the television show 60 Minutes, of "allegations or transactions" on which their actions "are based." Both Relators Merena and Robinson deny that any of the allegations of fraud which they set forth in their respective complaints relied in any way upon any disclosures made by others, whether public or private. Both contend that their allegations were based upon their firsthand personal knowledge acquired while employees of SBCL: Relator Robinson as the Medical Director of an SBCL laboratory in San Antonio, Texas and Relator Merena, as a billing analyst and Supervisor of Response Development at SBCL's national headquarters. Although some of the allegations in both complaints may have been similar to those upon which the Government successfully prosecuted NHL, there were many allegations encompassed, even within the "automated chemistry" claims that had not been included in any Prior disclosures to the Government, whether or not public.
The purpose of the "public disclosure bar" would appear to be intended to prevent a person taking advantage of and using publicly disclosed information, and to prevent the filing of "copy cat" complaints. If "based upon" means or is similar in meaning to "relied upon", neither Relator's complaint was based upon any disclosures, other than those that they learned as employees of SBCL. Again I note that the "public disclosure bar" of sub-section *442 (e)(4)(A) and (B), refers to an "action" being barred, not to certain allegations. Certainly the qui tam complaints were not subject to dismissal, even had the Government timely so moved. As I have heretofore noted, I will not dismiss or separate out various claims, including the "automated chemistry" claims, in determining an appropriate qui tam share.
The "no more than ten percent" provision of subsection (d) requires that the court find that the "action" be based "primarily on disclosures of specific information (other than information provided by the person bringing the action) relating to allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or Government Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media." I decline to make such a finding, irrespective of whether the "disclosures" must be public.
I conclude that the Relators, whether singly or in combination are entitled to a qui tam award in the 15 to 25 percent range on the net proceeds of the settlement. Those net proceeds are calculated as follows: Total recovery of the settlement and accrued interest, $333,976,266.40, less the total amount paid to the states Medicaid Fraud Units, $14,507,107, leaving a net balance of $319,469,159.40. In computing the proceeds upon which the Merena-Robinson Relators will be entitled to receive a share, there must be further deducted the amount of the agreed allocation to the Spear Relators of $13,297,829. This leaves a balance of proceeds of $306,171,330 upon which the disputed qui tam shares will be Calculated.

7. Relators' Contribution to the Prosecution of the Action

At the seven-day hearing in March, 1996, Relators Merena and Robinson presented evidence supporting their claims for a larger percentage of relators' share. The Government presented evidence to support their own arguments that the Relators are barred from recovery on the automated chemistry claims, and that the Relators contributed only minimally to the investigation of and settlement with SBCL on their other allegations.
Relator Merena has worked voluntarily with the Government for the last four years to secure a settlement in the qui tam cases against SBCL. While he was still employed as the supervisor of Response Development at SBCL, he provided the Government with information and documents for eighteen months after he filed his qui tam action. He continued to assist the Government in its investigation of SBCL for two years after the unsealing of his qui tam action, and after he left his employment at SBCL in March of 1995. The Government does not dispute that Relator Merena spent literally hundreds of hours assisting the Government at the Philadelphia Task Force's Media, Pennsylvania headquarters.
Relator Merena alleges that he first contacted the Government about what he suspected were fraudulent billing practices at SBCL in mid-August 1993 when he voluntarily placed a call to a toll-free government fraud alert hotline. Apparently, Relator Merena's phone call was routed and re-routed until he finally was referred to the United States Patent Office. The United States Patent Office, in turn, directed Relator Merena to James Sheehan, Chief, Civil Division of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Sheehan testified at deposition[26] that he did not take any notes to memorialize this phone call, but that he recalled an anonymous caller phoning in about the alleged fraud at SBCL. At deposition, Mr. Sheehan testified that he remembered that during his telephone conversation with Relator Merena, Relator Merena discussed *443 the fact that he was an employee of SBCL, and that he had concerns about the way the company was operating. Mr. Sheehan testified that Relator Merena thought that there might have been grounds to address SBCL's activities under the False Claims Act. Mr. Sheehan recalled that Relator Merena expressed concern about identifying himself. Mr. Sheehan recalls at least two other telephone contacts with Relator Merena after the initial phone call and before Relator Merena's counsel, Mr. Marc Raspanti, became involved.
Prior to any face-to-face meeting between Relator Merena and Mr. Sheehan, Relator Merena's counsel, Mr. Raspanti, provided Mr. Sheehan with information concerning a number of schemes ongoing at SBCL. The information provided included schemes to maximize Medicare revenues by "unbundling" or "exploding" its various test panels, including its automated chemistry panels.
Relator Merena's first face-to-face meeting with Mr. Sheehan was on October 9, 1993. Relator Merena's counsel, Mr. Raspanti, also was present. At this meeting, Relator Merena voluntarily provided additional information to Mr. Sheehan concerning SBCL's alleged fraudulent billing practices. Relator Merena explained his background and employment at SBCL. He began working at SBCL in 1986 as the Supervisor of the Third-Party Billing Department. Relator Merena moved up in the company, and was at the time he contacted Mr. Sheehan, supervisor of Response Development, where he handled SBCL's receipt of payments from Medicare and other payors. Relator Merena spent his entire career with SBCL working at its national headquarters.
At deposition, Mr. Sheehan testified that during this October 9, 1993 meeting, Relator Merena provided him with the names of various individuals who headed various functions at SBCL and with an overview of SBCL's operations throughout the country. Relator Merena indicated to Mr. Sheehan certain of SBCL's laboratories that he believed were involved in questionable acts, and he indicated to Mr. Sheehan certain parts of the country he thought would be most fruitful to the Government's investigation based on his experience at SBCL's national headquarters. Relator Merena described SBCL's National Billing Group, and SBCL's relationship with Pennsylvania Blue Shield ("PBS"), and he provided the names of employees of PBS and SBCL who were interacting with each other as to some of his allegations.
Relator Merena explained in detail how SBCL's "unbundling" or "exploding" scheme worked. He described that SBCL was looking for ways to maximize revenues, and that it attempted to do so by identifying laboratory tests which could be separated out from the standard multichannel battery of tests. He explained that individual states differed in how they paid SBCL for additional tests, and therefore SBCL could submit claims for unbundled tests to certain states and receive payment for the multi-channel battery of tests (the bundle) and bill again for certain tests which were already billed as part of the battery.
Relator Merena explained the unique test billing codes used by SBCL's laboratories and explained how the National Billing Group converted the laboratory codes in a way that improperly inflated Medicare revenues. He explained that SBCL even hired procedure code analysts whose job it was to maximize revenue for test panels, including automated blood chemistry panels.
Relator Merena explained SBCL's centralized computer billing systems. He described SBCL's scheme of "jamming" diagnosis codes, whereby SBCL's computer automatically added other diagnosis codes for particular claims where specific diagnoses are required. He stated that, in this way, SBCL obtained Medicare payment without obtaining necessary diagnosis information from the referring physician. He explained SBCL's alleged deceptive *444 marketing schemes. Relator Merena also discussed and explained SBCL's alleged practices of billing for tests which were not performed, improper billing for End Stage Renal Disease ("ESRD") patients, multiple kickback schemes used to entice referring physicians, and a particular diagnosis scheme related to pap smears. The October 9, 1993 meeting lasted about seven hours.
Prior to Relator Merena's suit, the Government had, in December 1992, concluded an investigation of NHL, which resulted in NHL pleading guilty in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California of submitting false claims to the Government and paying a $1 million criminal fine. The president of NHL also pleaded guilty to felony counts of submitting false claims to the Government and served a prison sentence. Additionally, NHL agreed to a civil settlement of $100 million with the Government and paid a monetary settlement to 33 individual states.[27]
By way of declaration, Carol Lam, Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of California, states that the issue in the NHL investigation was NHL's alleged practice of routinely adding non-medically necessary tests to automated chemistry panels and billing government health insurance programs separately for those added-on tests. Allegedly, NHL used deceptive marketing practices that lead physicians ordering laboratory tests to believe that the additional test results they were receiving with the automated chemistry panels came at little or no additional cost. Ms. Lam testified, by way of declaration and in open court, that during the course of the NHL investigation, the team of government agents and lawyers learned that the scheme at NHL was not unique to NHL, and began to suspect that many of NHL's competitors were also committing similar marketing and billing fraud. Ms. Lam testified that after the resolution of the NHL investigation, in late 1992, she and Mr. Freedman discussed the need to investigate and prosecute, where appropriate, the other major medical laboratories in the country, including SBCL.
Following the resolution of the NHL investigation, the Government gave press releases and its officials, including Ms. Lam made comments and statements in various forums, including television and the print media as well as at professional conferences, regarding the Government's investigation of NHL and its suspicion that fraudulent billing practices by medical laboratories were not unique to NHL. In December, 1992, numerous articles appeared in newspapers and industry publications across the country. The general gist of these articles was that the alleged billing practices at NHL were not unique to NHL, and that federal officials were continuing to investigate the marketing and billing practices of other national medical laboratories.
The successful NHL investigatory team evolved into a task force. This task force decided to commence a joint criminal, civil and administrative investigation of the seven other national laboratories. In the early summer of 1993, the task force became known as Operation LABSCAM or the LABSCAM Task Force. During the summer of 1993, the LABSCAM Task Force requested from the Program Integrity Branch of the Health Care Financing Administration ("HCFA"), all available national clinical laboratory billing data. HCFA provided the task force with tapes of billing data for 1991 through 1993. The data provided included laboratory claims submitted to Medicare for all laboratory tests by seven major medical laboratories including SBCL. From this data, Ms. Lam testified that the LABSCAM Task Force was able to identify numerous potential billing schemes by SBCL.
When asked on cross-examination about the Philadelphia Task Force's contribution *445 to the case, Laurence Freedman, Assistant Director, Commercial Litigation Branch, Civil Division, United States Department of Justice ("DOJ"), responded that he, and others at the DOJ in Washington, DC, did not know what the Philadelphia Task Force was doing in relation to these cases. He testified that the Philadelphia Task Force did not even know much about the case.
Both Assistant United States Attorney Lam and Freedman testified that up until the summer of 1993 the Government had been tracking anomalies and indicia of fraud as it related to SBCL's billing practices. Lam testified that the investigation into SBCL's billing practices began on August 24, 1993 with the issuance of subpoenas to seven medical laboratories, including SBCL.
On August 24, 1993 the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG) Office of Audit Services issued Comprehensive subpoenas to SBCL and six other medical laboratories. The Government received over 200 boxes of documents in response to its initial subpoena issued to SBCL. Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI") Special Agent Jacob Gregory of San Diego reviewed the SBCL documents and came up with documents which he thought would be helpful in prosecuting a Case against SBCL for its alleged fraudulent billing practices. These subpoenaed documents later became known as "hot documents" or "the hot documents file." From these so-called "hot documents", Special Agent Gregory also compiled a table of contents and created a time line setting forth critical dates of the SBCL alleged scheme.
The DOJ made the decision to transfer the investigation of SBCL to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. In accordance with this decision, Special Agent Gregory re-boxed the documents, time line, and table of contents and sent them to federal investigators in this district, sometime in July, 1993.
By August, 1993, media coverage of the alleged billing fraud in the medical laboratories industry continued. An article dated August 28, 1993, and headlined, "Medical Labs Subpoenaed in Medicaid-Medicare Probe", was distributed by the Associated Press wire service and was published in the Washington Post stating that some of the nation's leading medical testing laboratories had recently received federal subpoenas seeking documents for a "widening investigation of Medicaid and Medicare fraud". The article mentioned SBCL by name as being among those receiving a subpoena. The story of the Government's subpoena of documents from the seven major laboratories was picked up by other newspapers and industry publications. On September 19, 1993, CBS News broadcast a segment entitled "Blood Money" on its show 60 Minutes. The story, reported by Leslie Stahl, covered the alleged fraud involving automated chemistry panels. The show's Associate Producer Karen Jaffee went to SBCL with an order for an automated chemistry panel, a CBC, and thyroid test. On camera, Stahl and a medical doctor examined the bill generated by SBCL. The bill included an un-ordered but billed magnesium test.
By the end of 1993 the Government alleges that, in addition to the attorneys assigned to the investigation, there were six full-time federal agents from the FBI and the Defense Criminal Investigative Service ("DCIS"), and a full-time paralegal supervisor assigned to the LABSCAM Task Force. It is the Government's contention that its investigation of SBCL's alleged fraudulent billing practices was well on its way at the time Relator Merena filed his complaint, and even before he made his first contact with Mr. Sheehan. More importantly, the Government argues that its knowledge of the alleged fraud, its ongoing investigation, and the public disclosures of these facts constitute public disclosures for the purposes of the False Claims Act and therefore constitute a bar *446 to any recovery by Relator Merena and other relators.
Relator Merena testified in open court, however, that he did not view the 60 Minutes segment, nor did he read any of the numerous newspaper articles, press releases or industry publications. He contends that the allegations he made in his complaint were based on facts of which he has independent knowledge. He claims his allegations and the facts supporting them, therefore, are based on his knowledge and not on the disclosures of the Government's investigation into or suspicions of alleged fraudulent billing practices at SBCL.
Both Lam and Freedman testified that the information the Government had in the summer of 1993, at the time of the issuing of the subpoenas as well as the documents and other information the Government received in response to the subpoenas was insufficient for the Government to go forward and successfully prosecute a case against SBCL for violations of the False Claims Act. Nonetheless, the Government contends that its investigation and resolution of the NHL fraud case provided a blueprint that was easy to follow in its subsequent investigations of the other national medical laboratories, including SBCL. Ms. Lam testified in open court that once the Government understood the fraudulent schemes by NHL, the Government felt it would not be "rocket science" to uncover the same or similar schemes at the other laboratories. It is the Government's contention, therefore, that any investigation of SBCL would be more or less a matter of following a well laid out map.
Relator Merena argues, however, that if the Government had sufficient information at that time, settlement would not have taken four years to conclude. Relator Merena contends that the Government, by trivializing the extent to which Relator Merena contributed to the Government's investigation of SBCL, has minimized the contribution of the entire Philadelphia Task Force in settling the qui tam actions against SBCL.
In addition to the assistance Merena provided through October 9, 1993, at his first face-to-face meeting with the Government, Relator Merena made other significant and substantial contributions which led to the Government's ultimate settlement with SBCL. Relator Merena reviewed documents received from SBCL in response to three subpoenas, two of which he was helpful in preparing. Specifically, he helped the Government understand many of the internal documents received from SBCL in response to the subpoenas. He assisted FBI and LABSCAM Task Force agents in preparing for interviews of witnesses. He prepared outlines for interviews with witnesses. He assisted the task force in evaluating and reviewing the notes after the witness interviews were completed. He assisted in obtaining documents, many of which he fed to the Government during the eighteen months he was still an employee at SBCL. He assisted in preparing Government agents for the re-interview of witnesses. He provided technical support himself and legal support through his counsel to the Government in drafting subpoenas and key documents. He and his counsel provided assistance in the settlement process, and helped to put pressure on SBCL to reach a settlement of the case. He filed a qui tam action here in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania where the other qui tam actions against SBCL ultimately were transferred and settled.
It is undisputed that on November 8, 1993, counsel for Relator Merena provided Mr. Sheehan with a draft of Relator Merena's qui tam complaint, and on November 12, filed a qui tam complaint under seal in this court. His complaint alleged fraud by SBCL in SBCL's automated chemistry panels, urinalysis tests, prostate antigen tests, pap smear tests, tests performed for ESRD patients, tests not performed, and kickbacks. On the same day, Relator Merena provided the Government with his initial Notice of Disclosure. On December 13, 1993, Relator Merena provided the *447 Government with his first Supplemental Disclosure Statement which supported each of the claims raised in Relator Merena's earlier meetings with the Government, as well as those in his qui tam complaint.
Mr. Sheehan sought the assistance of Relator Merena and his counsel in drafting document requests that the Government could serve on SBCL. On March 7, 1994, Relator Merena provided the Government with information about SBCL's Lexington, Kentucky laboratory's practice of artificially reducing its Medicare accounts receivables by "jamming", or automatically adding, diagnosis codes to Medicare claims to facilitate their payment. On March 8, 1994, Relator Merena provided the Government with an annual recap of SBCL's 1993 results. On March 17, Relator Merena provided the Government a complete set of SBCL's 1993 monthly Billing and Accounts Receivable Reports. On March 21, 1994, Relator Merena provided the Government a summary of individuals and documents pertaining to SBCL.
Relator Merena met with Government officials on March 21, 1994. This meeting was arranged at the request of Mr. Sheehan. During this meeting, Relator Merena carefully explained to Mr. Sheehan how SBCL manipulated its billing for automated chemistry profiles in order to maximize reimbursement. Specifically, Relator Merena explained how SBCL separately billed certain tests, including the HDL, LDL, and RDW tests to the Atlanta, Georgia and Florida Medicare carriers to obtain greater Medicare reimbursement than if SBCL would have submitted those claims to PBS.
On April 29, 1994, Relator Merena's counsel, Mr. Raspanti, provided the Government with drafts of detailed and comprehensive subpoenas. On May 5 and May 6, 1994, Relator Merena provided the Government with copies of all documents previously provided to the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. On May 11, 1994, Relator Merena provided to the Government an internal SBCL directory which listed key personnel for each of SBCL's laboratories.
On June 22, 1994, Relator Merena and his counsel met with various Government officials in a meeting lasting approximately four hours. At this meeting, Relator Merena discussed and identified numerous SBCL employees, as well as former SBCL employees, describing who were likely to be cooperative witnesses and who would have the most relevant information about SBCL's various practices and schemes nationwide.
Also in the summer of 1994, Relator Merena and his counsel assisted the Government in drafting a letter to SBCL regarding a May 11, 1994 subpoena which Relator Merena and his counsel also helped draft. Relator Merena, at the Government's request, provided additional assistance concerning SBCL's "jamming" of diagnosis codes for pap smear tests and test performed on ESRD patients. Relator Merena also further described and provided documentation regarding SBCL's kickback scheme.
Throughout the investigation, the Government made repeated representations to him that he was a big help to the investigation of SBCL, and that the information he was providing was very useful. Relator Merena contends, and the Government agrees, that Relator Merena's counsel asked Mr. Freedman of the DOJ repeatedly about what the DOJ's position would be with regard to the relators' share.
It is undisputed that, after the Government reached the settlement in principle with SBCL, it asked Relator Merena and his counsel to summarize what they believed to be a basis for the fair and adequate resolution of relators' share issues. Relator Merena provided a detailed 45-page letter setting forth his contribution to the investigation and settlement of the case. (Merena Exhibit 70).
On March 22, 1996, Relator Merena, his counsel, and other Relators and their counsel, met with Mr. Sheehan, Mr. Freedman *448 and another Government official at the Government's request to discuss the settlement in principle with SBCL. It is undisputed that at the outset of the meeting, Mr. Sheehan congratulated counsel for the Relators and told them the Government was extremely appreciative of their assistance and efforts in bringing about the successful settlement of this case, which the Government claims is the most successful qui tam case in the history of the United States. The Government acknowledged the hundreds of hours Relator Merena and his counsel spent assisting the Government in achieving this settlement.
Relator Merena contends, however, that the Government never indicated at this meeting nor at any time prior to this meeting, that the Relators would not recover the statutory relators' share of the total settlement proceeds, or that the Government would seek to preclude Relators from recovery on certain of their allegations. Relator Merena contends that the Government never told the relators what their relators' share would be, but that the Government would be fair to the relators.
The Government, on the other hand, contends and Mr. Freedman so testified in open court, that if the Relators objected to the settlement proceedings and/or agreement in principle, they could have said so. The Government, in essence, contends that the Relators should have raised the issue of their shares themselves prior to agreeing to the settlement with SBCL.
Relator Robinson argues that he, too, substantially contributed to the investigation of and settlement with SBCL. From 1990 to 1993, he was the medical director of SBCL's San Antonio regional laboratory. He resigned his position at SBCL on June 1, 1993, after concluding that the company's alleged practice of "unbundling" or "exploding" its charges to federal health care programs was deliberate, and that he could not effect, from within, a change in the company's policy.
In May, 1993, he met with Relator Grossenbacher, an attorney, and discussed SBCL's alleged fraudulent policy and practices. Relator Grossenbacher then contacted DCIS Special Agent Larry Daniels about SBCL's alleged fraudulent policy and practice of unbundling charges to the Government for component parts of its automated chemistry panels.
It is uncontested that on or before June 6, 1993, DCIS Special Agent Daniels briefed fellow agent Scott Parker, who was investigating health Care fraud matters in Texas, on the information Special Agent Daniels had received from Relator Grossenbacher. On June 8, 1993, Relator Grossenbacher discussed with Special Agent Parker, SBCL's alleged nationwide policy and practice of unbundling charges for its automated chemistry panels. He claims that he provided Special Agent Parker with at least five documents which evidenced SBCL's alleged schemes, and that Special Agent Parker added these documents to his investigative file. Apparently, the information and evidence he and Relator Grossenbacher provided to Special Agents Daniels and Parker was the first specific information disclosed to the Government regarding SBCL's policy and practice of "unbundling" charges to federal health care programs for iron, TIBC, HDL, LDL, and magnesium tests.
It is uncontested that in mid-July 1993, Special Agent Parker opened a separate investigative file on SBCL with the information and documents that he had received from Relators Robinson and Grossenbacher. Relators Robinson and Grossenbacher filed their complaint on December 15, 1993, and on that same date, delivered to the Government material evidence and information in support of the complaint.
On April 20, 1994, Relator Robinson met with Mr. Freedman, FBI Special Agent Gregory, and DCIS Special Agent Parker. During this meeting, he was interviewed at length regarding his knowledge of SBCL's unbundling policies and practices including the billing and marketing of SBCL's laboratory *449 services. He was questioned about his career at SBCL, and of how he came to be aware of SBCL's alleged fraudulent practices. When asked for the names of current and former SBCL employees knowledgeable about SBCL's marketing of and billing for automated chemistry tests, Relator Robinson provided names of current and former employees he felt might be helpful to the investigation. At least one of these individuals was interviewed by the Government. Relators Robinson's and Grossenbacher's cases were later transferred to this court.
At Mr. Freedman's request, Relator Robinson came to Philadelphia for a meeting held on November 29, 1995. At that meeting Government officials advised Relators and their counsel that the Government was looking for litigation support from the relators and their counsel, and the Government officials discussed with Relator Robinson the testimony they anticipated from SBCL's medical experts. The Government indicated that it intended to call Dr. Robinson as an expert witness to controvert the anticipated testimony of SBCL's medical experts. At this meeting, the Government also questioned him more about the operations at SBCL, including quality assurance and compliance issues, and recordkeeping practices.
It is uncontested by the Government that, upon returning to Texas, Relators Robinson and Grossenbacher and their counsel spent many hours analyzing SBCL's responses to the unbundling issues and preparing a written rebuttal of SBCL's arguments in a 13-page letter that was sent to the Government on December 12, 1995.

8. The Merena - Robinson qui tam shares
The Government insists that I must decide which Relator is entitled to a qui tam share, and preclude the other from receiving anything, on the basis of "the first to file bar." Such an analysis and decision might be required if the Merena and Robinson Relators were arguing between themselves as to who should receive the qui tam award. Fortunately, and quite practically and sensibly, the Relators, long before this litigation began over the amount of the qui tam share the Government would have to pay, agreed among themselves as to the division of any proceeds, regardless to whom the award or awards were made. Therefore, I do not think it is necessary to decide that one Relator and not the other is entitled to a share.
Because both cases were settled for an overall sum, as heretofore noted, there is no way to quantify or to separate the recoveries between or among the qui tam Realtors. Because the Government never sought to dismiss any of the actions or any claims of the actions until after the settlement was completed and the cases were dismissed with prejudice, it is conceivable that each of the three qui tam Relators could have plausibly argued that each was entitled to a percentage between 15 and 25 percent of the entire proceeds. It is clear that the qui tam statute contemplated no more than one recovery. Relators seek nothing more than this. I will decide the percentage between 15 and 25 percent that should be awarded on the net proceeds.
Undoubtedly both Relators provided very valuable and substantial assistance to the Government in bringing these actions to a successful settlement and termination. A brief synopsis of the assistance has been outlined above. There was much more, but it would gain little to recite in full detail. The sole statutory criterion for an award is "the extent to which the person [qui tam Relator] substantially contributed to the prosecution of the action." In the final analysis, this can be no more than a judgment call by the decision maker. There is no precise way to quantify in a percentage the contribution of a qui tam Relator. This is particularly true, it seems to me, in a case where the actions are terminated by an overall settlement. There is no way of determining on the *450 record before me how much monetary value, if any, was added to the potential settlement when the cases were partially unsealed, and SBCL became aware for the first time of the identities of the qui tam "whistle-blowers." Likewise there is no way to quantify how much sooner the actions settled because of the assistance and persistence of the Relators. The evidence is strong, however, that it was the Relators who constantly urged to Government to enter into serious negotiations with SBCL.
I recognize that the Government would probably have continued to pursue at least the "automated chemistry" claims against SBCL, and would very likely have obtained a substantial settlement. How much such a settlement would have been without the assistance of Relators would be pure speculation. Relators had deep and extensive knowledge of the inner workings of SBCL and they were able to obtain, provide and more importantly interpret corporate billing records, without which the cases would have had serious problems.
As to the "Merena only" claims, in an earlier filing the Government suggested a qui tam award of 16 percent on the amount it allocated to those claims. The Relators suggest that they should be entitled to an overall share of 18 percent of the total proceeds, including the proceeds to the states that I have declined to include.
Whether we consider only the individual contributions of Merena or the individual contributions of the Robinson Relators, certainly some percentage above the minimum 15 percent should be awarded. Both Relators substantially contributed, and were willing to contribute as much as the Government was willing to receive. I conclude that the substantial contribution of each was equal to that of the other. Thus if only one, but not the other qui tam Relator would be entitled to an award on the whole of the proceeds, I would award the same percentage regardless of which one was entitled.
In reading the depositions and evidence received into evidence, and listening to the arguments of counsel, I am left with the impression that the attorneys in charge of the LABSCAM investigation, conducted largely from San Diego and Washington, DC by the DOJ seek to take far more credit for the overall success of the proceedings than is rightly due. The suggestion has been presented that San Diego and Washington took care of all the automated chemistry investigation and claims, which the Government contends was the most valuable part of the case, and that the United States Attorney's office in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, through Mr. Stiles, the United States Attorney, and Mr. Sheehan, an Assistant United States Attorney, and the investigators working under their direction played only a minor part in bringing about the successful Conclusion of the actions. Perhaps the reason the litigation has been presented in this light is because the contacts that Relator Merena, and, to a large extent, Relator Robinson had with the Government was in providing assistance to the investigators and United States Attorneys from this district, and the Government wants to minimize the contributions of the Relators in order to lower their ultimate award.
No matter how the qui tam award in this case is calculated, it will be quite large. I recognize that some of the arguments presented by the Government attorneys may have been caused by a sincere desire to save as much of the proceeds as possible for the Government. However, an Act of Congress provides for substantial awards in order that persons who acquire first-hand knowledge of false claims being presented to the Government will come forth and file meritorious qui tam complaints. The success of this legislation in continuing to achieve its goals can only be assured by unstintingly providing the qui tam awards dictated by Congress, irrespective of the size of the awards.
Relators undoubtedly sincerely believe that their respective contributions toward *451 bringing about the overall settlement were not only substantial but vital to the highly successful outcome of the actions. They therefore may have exaggerated to some extent the importance of their individual contributions. Similarly, I am convinced that the Government through the DOJ has greatly underestimated and minimized the help provided by the Relators. I believe that the DOJ attorneys who have represented the Government in the present qui tam relator share proceedings have been largely unaware of the tremendous effort put forth by the United States Attorney's Office for this district. That office and its investigative staff relied very heavily upon the aid of the Relators, particularly upon Mr. Merena. It was primarily through the insistence of both the Relators and Mr. Sheehan that serious and meaningful settlement negotiations were commenced. It is quite clear that the automated chemistry claims were not investigated and developed solely by the LABSCAM task force. The development of the total facts as to all of the claims asserted by the qui tam complaints of Merena and Robinson, including the automated chemistry allegations, were developed primarily through the task force operating out of the Media Office of the United States Attorney's office in this district.
The ultimate decision as to the percentage share to be awarded is my own overall assessment of the extent to which Relator Merena and/or the Robinson Relators substantially contributed to the successful prosecution and settlement of the actions. As previously noted, some percentage above the 15 percent minimum amount is entirely appropriate in this case. In my judgment a qui tam share of 17 percent of the net proceeds of $306,171,330 is proper. Other persons who might make a similar decision based on the same facts, might well provide a larger or a smaller percentage.
The net proceeds upon which the qui tam share will be computed is, as previously set forth, $306,171,330. Seventeen percent of that amount is $52,049,126. From that amount there must be deducted the amount of the partial summary judgment awarded of $9,736,324.[28] A judgment will be entered in favor the Merena- Robinson Relators, jointly, in the sum of $42,312,802.
All factual statements contained in this opinion shall be deemed to be findings of fact. In addition, all of the submitted unopposed proposed findings of fact presented by either of the Relators and by the Government, shall be deemed as additional findings of fact.
Perhaps Congress never contemplated that such large awards might occur, although that seems doubtful. Congress is, of course, capable of amending the statute at anytime, should it consider that it has been too generous in specifying the percentages to be awarded. If so, Congress might also be more helpful in defining when the lesser percentage ranges should be utilized and also in clarifying the several seemingly unclear and conflicting sections of the statute.
For the reasons set forth in this opinion judgment will be entered in favor of the Merena and the Robinson relators jointly in the sum of $42,312,802, for the balance of their qui tam shares.

JUDGMENT
For the reasons set forth in the accompanying opinion, Judgment is entered in favor of the Relators, Robert J. Merena in Civil Action 93-5974 and Glenn Grossenbacher and Charles W. Robinson in Civil Action 95-6953, jointly and against the United States of America in the sum of $42,312,802.
It is further ORDERED that any and all pending motions in Civil Actions 93-5974, *452 95-6953 and 95-6551 not otherwise expressly ruled upon in the accompanying opinion are DENIED.
NOTES
[1]  42 states and the District of Columbia executed separate settlement agreements with SBCL for their respective Medicaid losses from the alleged false claims paid to SBCL. Those agreements, together with accrued interest total $14,507.107 that they received from the total settlement proceeds.
[2]  LABSCAM is an acronym for a governmental investigative team that was formed and evolved an a result an investigation of National Health Laboratories, Inc. (NHL) in the Southern District of California. The NHL litigation resulted in successful civil and criminal proceedings against NHL, for alleged billing practice frauds similar to many of those alleged against SBCL. After the successful conclusion of the NHL case, the LAB-SCAM team was formed and proceeded to investigate alleged illegal billing practices of many of the large independent medical laboratories, including SBCL. The LABSCAM investigation, operating primarily from San Diego, California and Washington, DC, focused almost exclusively on the so-called "automated chemistry" claims.
[3]  All "filed document #" refer to documents filed in Civil Action 93-5974.
[4]  Other qui tam actions have been filed against SBCL and transferred to this court. The qui tam relators in those cases were held to be entitled to no qui tam share of the settlement proceeds involved in this litigation (filed document # 13). Their actions were dismissed, except as to a single claim that was severed because the claim was not encompassed within the terms of the Settlement Agreement and Release.
[5]  Relator Merena filed suit in this court an November 12, 1993. The Robinson action was originally filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas in December, 1993 (Civil Action 93-1070), and the Spear action was originally filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in February, 1995 (Civil Action C95-0501-DLJ). The Robinson and Spear actions were transferred by agreement to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in the fall of 1995.
[6]  The order directed that: "(1) ง 314.731,103.35 of the settlement proceeds, plus interest be electronically transferred to the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern Distract of Pennsylvania; (2) $3,703,419.14 be electronically transferred to the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia; (3) $14,460,124.01 be electronically transferred into an account at the Chase Manhattan Bank for the National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units, for further distribution to the states with which SBCL had settled; (4) all interest, income, and dividends either deposited or accrued in the escrow account after February 24, 1997 be electronically transferred to the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to be further distributed in equal proportion to any entitled party or parties." These amounts total $332,894,646.50. However, the parties agree that the total proceeds disbursed were $333,976,266.
[7]  The Attorneys have advised the court that SBCL and Relator Merena have agreed as to the amount of Relator Merena's attorney fees and costs in Civil Action 93-5974.
[8]  The Government and the Consolidated Plaintiffs contended that LaCorte's Claim 1 (Complete Blood Count Claim), Claim 3 (Unauthorized Testing an Part of a Screening Program), and Claim 4 (Unauthorized Testing as Part of an Annual Audit Program) were not settled, but that all of Claim 2 (Substitution of More Extensive Chemistry Profiles) and Claim 5 (Misleading Requisition Forms) were settled.
[9]  Relator Jeffrey Clausen also filed a Motion to Extend Time for Filing Notice of Appeal (filed document 0102), but that motion was denied (filed document # 212).
[10]  The Government did not elect to intervene until after it had agreed with SBCL on specific settlement terms to resolve all of the claims in the Consolidated Plaintiffs' cases and long After the February 6, 1996 agreement in principle had been negotiated.
[11]  Subsection W of 31 U.S.C. ง 1321 provides in part that: Amounts (except amounts received by the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) that are analogous to the funds named in subsection (a) of this section and are received by the United States Government as trustee shall be deposited in an appropriate trust fund account in the Treasury.

31 U.S.C. ง 9702, Investment of Trust Funds, specifies that: Except as required by a treaty of the United States, amounts held in trust by the United States (including annual interest earned on the amounts) โ
(1) shall be invested in Government obligations; and
(2) shall earn interest at an annual rate of at least five percent.
[12]  The six claims Merena claims only he raised are as follows: 1) urinalysis tests; 2) prostate specific antigen ("PSA") tests; 3) pap smear tests; 4) tests performed for end stage renal disease patients ("ESRD"); 5) tests not performed ("TNP"); and 6) kickbacks.
[13]  The Government states, "Mr. Merena would have this Court reserve the question of whether `the Government's allocation of the settlement proceeds among issues and to the various states was improper.'" (United States' opposition to motion of Robert J. Merena for Partial Summary Judgment, p. 2).
[14]  The $64,906,828 figure includes a pro-rated share of the accrued interest. The Government appears to agree that accrued interest should be treated the same as principal in calculating the qui tam share or shares of the proceeds.
[15]  The findings at this hearing are discussed in more detail under the heading, "Relators' Contribution to the Prosecution of the Action," of this Opinion.
[16]  Merena and Robinson agree, however, as above noted, that from this total there be deducted the amount allocated to settling the Spear parties' claims. Consequently, the Relators are requesting an award of 18% ื ($333,976.266.40 - $13.297.829) which totals $57,722,118.73.
[17]  Using the above figures, the net balance would be $64,887,859, a Discrepancy of $20,969.
[18]  The Settlement Agreement did not make any mention of any specific state allocations, but it was understood by the parties that a sum of the proceeds would be paid to the states, as in reflected in my Order of February 24, 1997 which Orders that $14,460.124.01 be disbursed for the settlement of the states' claims. The amount actually disbursed was $14,507,107.
[19]  There appears to be no dispute that both Relators Merena and Robinson, in their qui tam complaints, made allegations of fraud involving automated chemistry tests, although Relator Merena's may have been rather general.
[20]  A non-public governmental investigation would not bar the filing of a qui tam action. See discussion, infra.
[21]  In the 60 Minutes story, one of the shows Associate Producers went to a SmithKline laboratory with an order for a SMAC (automated blood chemistry panel), CBC, and thyroid test. The bill generated by SBCL was then examined on camera, and the bill was found to include an un-ordered, but billed, magnesium test. Transcript of "Blood Money," 60 Minutes, CBS News, September 19, 1993, p. 20.
[22]  The Government indicates that the state funds total $14,507,107 which includes the pro rated share of the earned interest.
[23]  The Government quite properly emphasized in announcing the settlement with SBCL that the settlement was the largest recovery ever obtained under the False Claims Act for health care fraud.
[24]  United States v. General Electric, 808 F.Supp. 580 (S.D.Ohio 1992); United States v. Stern, 818 F.Supp. 1521 (M.D.Fla.1993); United States ex rel. Coughlin v. IBM, 992 F.Supp. 137 (N.D.N.Y.1998); United States ex rel. Burr v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida, 882 F.Supp. 166 (M.D.Fla.1995).
[25]  Apparently because of a few days extra interest earned under item (4) of the order, the actual amount paid to the Medicaid Fraud Control Units was $14,507,107, and the total settlement proceeds, with interest was $333,976,266. These later two figures will be used for all further calculations of the qui tam shares.
[26]  Mr. Sheehan testified at deposition, but was not called as a witness in open court during the evidentiary hearing which began on March 16, 1998.
[27]  The NHL case also was a qui tam action.
[28]  The Government has paid the amount of the partial summary judgment to Relator Merena.

OPINION
KISER, Senior District Judge:

4
Mr. Norton Baskin (Baskin) is the personal representative of the estate of his late wife, Mrs. Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings Baskin (Rawlings).  In Count I of the Second Amended Complaint, Baskin and the University of Florida Foundation (Foundation) (formerly known as the University of Florida Endowment Corporation) seek to recover from The Seajay Society, Inc.  (Seajay) physical possession of certain documents which appellants assert are assets of the Rawlings estate.  In Count II, the Foundation seeks damages and injunctive relief for Seajay's alleged violation of, and alleged threats to continue violating, its copyright.1


5
Senior Judge Perry tried this case without a jury on September 5 and 6, 1991.  After the trial, post-trial briefs, and closing arguments, the lower court, on October 1, 1992, entered judgment for Seajay as to Counts I and II, but did not render a decision on the counterclaim.2  The district court also did not file findings of facts or conclusions of law at that time.  Baskin and the Foundation noticed an appeal to this Court on October 30, 1992.  This Court, however, dismissed the appeal without prejudice because of the district court's failure to address the counterclaim or include findings of fact and conclusions of law.


6
On February 5, 1997, after reopening the record, receiving additional evidence on Count II, and hearing renewed closing arguments, the district court found for Seajay as to Counts I and II and the counterclaim.  The district court also filed its findings of fact and conclusions of law.  That decision is now before this Court on appeal.

I. FACTS

7
Rawlings died on December 14, 1953 in St. John's County, Florida.  She was the noted author of books such as Sojourner, Cross Creek, and The Yearling, which won the 1939 Pulitzer Prize.


8
In her will, Rawlings designated Baskin and the Foundation as coexecutors of her estate.  She also designated one of her closest friends, Ms. Julia Scribner Bigham (Bigham) as literary executrix of her estate.  Bigham was the daughter of publisher Charles Scribner, whose company, Charles Scribner's Sons Publishers (Scribner Publishing), published all of Rawlings' works.


9
On January 27, 1954, the County Judge's Court for St. John's County, Florida appointed Baskin as the sole executor of Rawlings' estate.  The probate court never appointed the Foundation as an executor.  Likewise, the probate court never appointed Bigham as literary executrix, or as any other fiduciary.  Bigham acted in the capacity as literary executrix, however, under the auspices of Baskin, from 1953 until her death on October 24, 1961.3


10
Rawlings' will left immediate custody of "all manuscripts, all notes, all correspondence, and all literary property of any kind" to Bigham, in her role as literary executrix.  Bigham had the power to destroy any of the "notes, manuscripts or correspondence" she believed should be destroyed.  She also had the power to determine which materials would be published.  Bigham could keep the literary works as long as she wanted, then she was to turn them over to the University of Florida Library.  Any income from these literary materials was to be held in trust by the Foundation, along with the remainder of Rawlings' property.


11
Acting in her role as literary executrix, Bigham collected Rawlings' correspondence, papers, manuscripts, and other materials from Baskin.  Bigham also obtained some of Rawlings' materials from Scribner Publishing.  At no time did Baskin, the only court appointed fiduciary, ever request an inventory of the materials collected by Bigham.


12
Bigham scrupulously performed her duties as literary executrix.  During the remainder of her life, she wrote an introduction to and posthumously published The Secret River, and then directed the original manuscript be sent to the University of Florida Library;  she posthumously published The Marjorie Rawlings Reader, and then returned the typescript and original materials to Scribner Publishing;  she worked to ensure that any works retained by Scribner Publishing were later sent to the University of Florida Library;  and she transferred numerous other documents to the University of Florida Library.  After Bigham's death in 1961, Baskin did not ask any one else to assume the role of literary executor.  Instead, as executor of the estate, he assumed that role.


13
Baskin was not as conscientious as Bigham in performing the duties of literary executor.  He admitted that he was aware that Bigham had a significant number of Rawlings' documents at the time of her death, yet he never asked Bigham's family to return any of those documents to the Rawlings estate.  He stated that he believed the documents were under consideration for publication by Scribner Publishing, but admits that he knew the documents were at Bigham's residence.  In any event, he failed to confirm whether or not the documents were part of the Rawlings estate and whether or not they were being considered for publication by Scribner Publishing.  Four years after Bigham's death on October 24, 1961, the Florida probate court closed administration of Rawlings' estate with Baskin still having failed to clarify the status of those documents.


14
The documents remained stored at the residence of Bigham's widower in two boxes which were labeled "MKR letters and papers."   In 1987, Bigham's widower was moving from the residence, so he and his children decided to dispose of the contents of the boxes.  Ms. Ann Hutchins, Bigham's daughter, contacted Mr. Glenn Horowitz, a nationally known dealer of rare books and literary and historical manuscripts, to help them sell the material.  Horowitz and his staff cataloged the contents of the two boxes as follows:


15
1.  Letters written from Rawlings to Bigham from 1939 to 1953;


16
2.  Correspondence of Bigham in connection with her duties as literary executrix;


17
3.  Publisher's typescript with editor's blue-penciled emendations of Rawlings' The Secret River (a children's book posthumously published by Bigham);


18
4.  Miscellaneous original typescripts, manuscripts, and story ideas written by Rawlings, including her first unpublished novel, Blood of My Blood;


19
5.  Letters written from Bigham to Rawlings from 1940 to 1953.4


20
After compiling the catalog of documents, Horowitz contacted Dr. James Meriwether, an officer of Seajay, about the letters.  Seajay is a small, non-profit organization dedicated to enhancing public aware ness of, and interest in, unduly neglected aspects of South Carolina and southern culture.  After negotiations, Seajay obtained the documents by partial purchase and partial gift from the Bigham estate.


21
After purchasing the documents, Seajay made one whole copy of Blood Of My Blood for Dr. Anne Blythe (Blythe).  Blood of My Blood is Rawlings' first novel;  it was written in 1928, is 183 pages long, and has never been published.  Blythe, also an officer of Seajay, used the copy in preparing a critical review of Blood of My Blood.   Seajay made the copy so that Blythe would not damage the fragile original during her analysis.  Seajay also made a partial copy5 of the manuscript which it sent to the Rare Books Room at the University of Florida Library.  Seajay made this copy for the dual purpose of allowing Baskin, or his designee, to view and authenticate it, and allowing the University of Florida Press to view it and determine if it was worthy of publication.  Access to the copy was restricted, and photocopying it was prohibited.6  The University of Florida Library eventually returned its copy to Seajay.


22
In April of 1988, Blythe orally presented her critical analysis of Blood of My Blood to a symposium of the Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings Society at the University of Florida.  Between 150 and 200 members of Rawlings Society attended the symposium.  In the presentation, Blythe quoted approximately 2,464 words from the text of Blood of My Blood, or four to six percent of the total text.  Blythe submitted a hard copy of her paper for publication with the Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings Society Journal.  She also hoped to publish an edited version of her presentation as an introduction to Blood of My Blood, which the University of Florida Press wanted to publish in its entirety.  Blythe was aware that neither the Society's Symposium nor the University of Florida Press would be able to publish her article, much less Blood of My Blood, without first obtaining the permission of the copyright holder.  Neither publisher was able to secure the necessary permission, thus neither Blood of My Blood nor Blythe's paper has ever been published.7


23
On February 9, 1990, the St. John's County, Florida probate court re-opened administration of Rawlings' estate, allowing Baskin to bring this suit on behalf of the estate.  Baskin then filed the original Complaint, in which he sought recovery of the documents from Seajay, on May 18, 1990.  He amended his Complaint on September 21, 1990 to include the Foundation's claim for damages and injunctive relief under the Copyright Act.  At trial, on September 6, 1991, Baskin and the Foundation amended the Amended Complaint so that the Foundation could also assert an action for recovery of the documents under Count I. On February 5, 1997, the district court entered final judgment in favor of Seajay as to Counts I and II and its counterclaim.

II. POSSESSION OF THE DOCUMENTS

24
As to Count I of the Second Amended Complaint, the lower court made three alternative holdings which supported its finding for Seajay.  First, it held that Baskin's claim in Count I was barred by South Carolina's six year statute of limitations, S.C.Code Ann. § 15-3-530(4) (Law.Co-op.1997), and that the Foundation had no independent claim to a possessory interest in the contested documents. Second, the lower court held that even if Baskin and the Foundation had a possessory interest in the documents, Seajay's title in them was protected as a good faith purchaser for value from a dealer in goods of the kind.  S.C.Code Ann. § 36-2-403(2).  Third, the district court addressed the merits of the case, and held that Baskin and the Foundation failed to prove that either had a right to possession of the documents.  The appellants attack each one of these holdings.  In affirming the decision of the lower court, we need only address whether or not Baskin's claim is barred by the relevant statute of limitations.8


25
South Carolina Code § 15-3-530(4) provides a six year limitations period for "an action for the specific recovery of personal property."   Such an action must be commenced within six years after the claimant "knew or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known that he had a cause of action."  S.C.Code Ann. § 15-3-535;  see also Campus Sweater and Sportswear Co. v. M.B. Kahn Constr.  Co., 515 F.Supp. 64, 79 (D.S.C.1979) (holding that "discovery rule" in § 15-3-535 applies to claims under § 15-3 530(4)), aff'd, 644 F.2d 877 (4th Cir.1981).  The lower court held that Baskin, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have known that he had a cause of action to recover the contested documents on October 24, 1961, the date of Bigham's death.


26
The determination that Baskin "knew or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known that he had a cause of action" almost thirty years before bringing his action is a finding of fact.  Thus, it is subject to a "clearly erroneous" standard of review.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 52.


27
The lower court made its determination by relying upon fifteen subsidiary facts drawn solely from an examination of Baskin's own deposition testimony and interrogatory responses.9  The most relevant of those facts to this Court are that:  (i) Bigham worked, not as a fiduciary under a court order, but under the auspices of Baskin, the sole court appointed fiduciary of the Rawlings estate;  (ii) Baskin delivered numerous documents to Bigham following Rawlings' death and knew that Bigham collected documents from Scribner Publishing, as well;  (iii) Baskin knew that Bigham had some of Rawlings' documents at her home when she died in October of 1961;  (iv) as executor of the estate, Baskin assumed the role of literary executor upon Bigham's death;10  (v) despite his knowledge that Bigham had some of Rawlings' documents in her possession at the time of her death and his understanding that the documents were now his responsibility as executor of the estate, Baskin did not request to review the documents to determine if they were the property of the estate, nor did he ask that the documents be returned to his possession;  and (vi) Baskin never requested the return of the documents from 1961 to 1965, while administration of Rawlings' estate remained open.11


28
The evidentiary support for the district court's factual finding is more than sufficient to withstand review under a clearly erroneous standard.  We concur with the district court that even if the contested documents were part of the Rawlings' estate, Baskin's cause of action to recover the documents arose in 1961 and expired, under South Carolina law, in 1967.  Thus, his attempt to now recover possession of the documents is time barred.  Because Baskin's claim is time barred, and because the Foundation has waived its claim to possession of the documents, we affirm the district court's decision as to Count I of the Second Amended Complaint.

III. COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT

29
In Count II of the Second Amended Complaint, the Foundation seeks damages and an injunction for the past and prospective infringement of its copyright in Blood of My Blood.12  Specifically, the Foundation seeks damages for the entire copy of Blood of My Blood provided by Seajay to Blythe;  the partial copy provided by Seajay to the University of Florida Library;  and for Blythe's oral presentation, which quoted and paraphrased Blood of My Blood, and her attempts to publish that presentation.  The Foundation seeks the injunction because of alleged threats made by Seajay to disseminate copies of Blood of My Blood to other archives which maintain collections of Rawlings' works.


30
The district court held that the allegedly infringing copies were permissible under the fair use exception of 17 U.S.C.A. § 107.  According to the lower court, Blythe's paper constituted a scholarly appraisal of Blood of My Blood from a literary and biographical perspective, for which extensive quoting from a copyrighted work is permissible.  As for her attempts to publish the scholarly criticism, the lower court found that she understood that the paper would not be published unless the publisher first obtained the permission of the copyright holder, and, in fact, her paper never was published.  The lower court found that the complete copy of Blood of My Blood given to Blythe was permissible since it was provided to prevent damage to the original manuscript during the course of her scholarly work.  Regarding the partial copy sent to the University of Florida Library, the district court found that it was made for the dual purposes of allowing Baskin, or his designee, to authenticate it and to allow the University of Florida Press to determine whether it was worthy of publication.  The court also decided that Seajay knew that no publication of the novel would take place without first obtaining the permission of the copyright holder.


31
The claim for injunctive relief is based upon a letter written by Seajay's counsel on September 13, 1989, which the Foundation claims threatened the dissemination of additional copies of Blood of My Blood in violation of the Foundation's copyright.  The lower court decided that the alleged threat did not constitute a threat at all.  Rather, the court found that the letter constituted a request by Seajay for permission to copy Blood of My Blood.

A. Claim for Damages

32
Seajay concedes that the copies it made of Blood of My Blood constitute copyright infringement, unless they are protected by an exception to the Copyright Act.  Seajay argues that its copies are protected by the fair use exception to copyright infringement found at 17 U.S.C.A. § 107.


33
"Fair use is a mixed question of law and fact."  Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U.S. 539, 560, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 2230, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985).  Thus, we review the district court's legal conclusions de novo.  American Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc., 60 F.3d 913, 918 (2d Cir.1994).  The district court's subsidiary findings of fact are, of course, subject to a clearly erroneous standard of review.  Id.


34
"Section 106 of the Copyright Act confers a bundle of exclusive rights to the owner of the copyright," Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 546, 105 S.Ct. at 2223; 17 U.S.C.A. § 106 (West 1996 & Supp.1997), including the "right of first publication."  Salinger v. Random House, Inc., 811 F.2d 90, 95 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 890, 108 S.Ct. 213, 98 L.Ed.2d 177 (1987).  Section 107 of the Act provides an exception to the copyright holder's exclusive rights:  "the fair use of a copyrighted work ... is not an infringement of copyright."  17 U.S.C.A. § 107.  "Any individual may reproduce a copyrighted work for a 'fair use';  the copyright owner does not possess the exclusive right to such a use."  Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 433, 104 S.Ct. 774, 784, 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984).  This fair use exception permits photocopying of copyrighted material "for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research."13  17 U.S.C.A. § 107.


35
Fair use is an "equitable rule of reason," for which "no generally applicable definition is possible."   H.R.Rep. No. 94-1476, at 65 (1976), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin. News at 5659, 5679.  The statute requires a "case-by-case analysis" to determine whether a particular use is fair.  Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 577, 114 S.Ct. 1164, 1170, 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994).  While Congress has "eschewed a rigid, bright-line approach to fair use," Sony, 464 U.S. at 448 n. 31, 104 S.Ct. at 792 n. 31, it has set forth four factors to guide a court when deciding whether a particular use is fair:  (1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;  (2) the nature of the copyrighted work;  (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole;  and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.  17 U.S.C.A. § 107.  These factors are not exclusive, but are "particularly relevant to the fair use question."  Maxtone-Graham v. Burtchaell, 803 F.2d 1253, 1260 (2d Cir.1986), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1059, 107 S.Ct. 2201, 95 L.Ed.2d 856 (1987).  These four statutory factors may not be "treated in isolation, one from another.  All are to be explored, and the results weighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright."  Campbell, 510 U.S. at 578, 114 S.Ct. at 1171.


36
i. Character and Purpose


37
The first factor to be considered is the purpose and character of the challenged use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for non-profit educational purposes.  17 U.S.C.A. § 107(1).


38
a. Character


39
"The enquiry here may be guided by the examples given in the preamble to § 107, looking to whether the use is for criticism, or comment, or news reporting, and the like....  The central purpose of this inquiry is to see ... whether the new work merely' supersede[s] the objects' of the original creation, or instead adds something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message;  it asks, in other words, whether and to what extent the new work is transformative.  Although such transformative use is not absolutely necessary for a finding of fair use, the goal of copyright, to promote science and the arts, is generally furthered by the creation of transformative works....  [T]he more transformative the new work, the less will be the significance of other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of fair use."  Campbell, 510 U.S. at 578-79, 114 S.Ct. at 1171 (citations omitted).


40
We find that the district court was correct in characterizing Blythe's paper as "a scholarly appraisal of Blood of My Blood from a biographical and literary perspective."  Baskin v. Seajay Society, Inc., No. 3:90-1100-0, at 30 (D.S.C. February 5, 1997).  A reading of Blythe's paper clearly indicates that she attempted to shed light on Rawlings' development as a young author, review the quality of Blood of My Blood, and comment on the relationship between Rawlings and her mother.  The "further purpose" and "different character" of Blythe's work make it transformative, rather than an attempt to merely supersede Blood of My Blood.


41
While it does quote from and paraphrase substantially Blood of My Blood, its purpose is to criticize and comment on Ms. Rawlings' earliest work.  Thus, Blythe's transformative paper fits within several of the permissible uses enumerated in § 107;  it has productive uses as criticism, comment, scholarship, and literary research.  While this finding is not determinative, it is one factor supporting the district court's finding of a fair use.  See Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 561, 105 S.Ct. at 2230-31;  Wright v. Warner Books, Inc., 953 F.2d 731, 736 (2d Cir.1991) ("[T]here is a strong presumption that factor one favors the defendant if an allegedly infringing work fits the description of uses described in section 107.").


42
b. Purpose


43
The Foundation contends that Blythe was partially motivated by prospective royalties from the publication of her scholarly criticism, and that such commercial motivation negates any scholarly motivation.  Under the fair use doctrine, commercial use of an allegedly infringing work is more disfavored than noncommercial use.  See Sony, 464 U.S. at 449, 104 S.Ct. at 792.   Nonetheless, while there is evidence that Blythe hoped to profit from her paper, this factor alone is not dispositive of the fair use issue.  "[T]hough it is a significant factor, whether the profit element of the fair use calculus affects the ultimate determination of whether there is a fair use depends on the totality of the factors considered;  it is not itself controlling."  Rogers v. Koons, 960 F.2d 301, 309 (2d Cir.)  (citation omitted), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 934, 113 S.Ct. 365, 121 L.Ed.2d 278 (1992).14


44
"The crux of the profit/nonprofit distinction is not whether the sole motive of the use is monetary gain but whether the user stands to profit from exploitation of the copyrighted material without paying the customary price."  Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 562, 105 S.Ct. at 2231.   Courts should also "consider the public benefit resulting from a particular use notwithstanding the fact that the alleged infringer may gain commercially."  Sega Enters.  Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc., 977 F.2d 1510, 1523 (9th Cir.1992).  This public benefit typically involves "the development of art, science, and industry."  Rosemont Enters., Inc. v. Random House, Inc., 366 F.2d 303, 307 (2d Cir.1966) (citation omitted), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 1009, 87 S.Ct. 714, 17 L.Ed.2d 546 (1967).


45
First, there is no evidence of an exploitative motive in any of the allegedly infringing uses.  There was no commercial motive, much less an exploitative motive, in the complete copy provided to Blythe.  Her copy was provided in pursuit of her scholarly objective and only because she might harm the fragile, seventy year old original manuscript during her analysis.  There also was no exploitative motive underlying the University of Florida Library's partial copy.  One of Seajay's motivations for delivering the copy was to authenticate it as a work of Ms. Rawlings.  Clearly, this was non-commercial and nonexploitative.  The other purpose behind the copy was to assess the worthiness of Blood of My Blood for publication.  While this was potentially a commercial motivation, there was no risk of exploitation since Seajay understood that such publication could not take place without the permission of the copyright holder.


46
As for Dr. Blythe's paper, there was a potential commercial motivation in that Dr. Blythe may have received royalties if her paper were published, however, there was no attempt to exploit the Foundation.  The paper was only to be published if the necessary permission were obtained from the copyright holder.  Since such permission was not obtained, the paper was not published and no royalties were ever received.


47
Second, all of Seajay's uses unquestionably served the "public benefit" and "the development of art."   The Blythe copy was provided by Seajay to protect the fragile original from damage during a scholarly literary criticism of the work.  The Library copy was provided for authentication and determination of worthiness for publication, publication which would not take place without the permission of the copyright holder.  As noted above, the Blythe paper was for the purposes of scholarship, criticism, comment, and literary research.  All of these purposes serve the public benefit and aid in the development of the arts.


48
Thus, in general, the challenged uses of Blood of My Blood were for noncommercial, educational purposes.  To the extent there was any commercial motivation behind the uses, there was no attempt to exploit Blood of My Blood to the detriment of the Foundation.


49
A subsidiary enquiry to the commercial/non-commercial distinction is whether the allegedly infringing uses "supplant[ed] the copyright holder's commercially valuable right of first publication."  Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 562, 105 S.Ct. at 2231.   In this case, Seajay's uses of Blood of My Blood had neither the "intended purpose," nor the "incidental effect," of usurping the Foundation's right of first publication.  See id.   First, there is no evidence that Seajay intended to publish Blood of My Blood before the Foundation.  In fact, all of the evidence indicates that Seajay sought the Foundation's approval to publish the work, and that when such approval was not forthcoming, it did not publish Blood of My Blood.15  Second, Seajay's uses did not have the effect of supplanting a potential publication of Blood of My Blood  by the Foundation.  Blythe's copy was seen only by Dr. Blythe as she performed her scholarly review.  The Library's copy was seen only by a representative of Baskin and representatives of the University of Florida Press.  Blythe's paper was presented only to between 150 and 200 members of the Rawlings Society, the editor of the Society's Symposium, and an editor for University of Florida Press.  None of these disseminations of Blood of My Blood was sufficient to support a finding that Seajay supplanted the Foundations's right of first publication.


50
For the aforementioned reasons, the purpose and character of Seajay's allegedly infringing uses weigh heavily in favor of finding the uses fair under 17 U.S.C.A. § 107.


51
ii. Nature of Copyrighted Work


52
The second statutory consideration is the nature of the copyrighted work.  17 U.S.C.A. § 107(2).  "This factor calls for recognition that some works are closer to the core of intended protection than others, with the consequence that fair use is more difficult to establish when the former works are copied."  Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586, 114 S.Ct. at 1175.


53
Creative works and unpublished works are closer to the core of works protected by the Copyright Act.  "The law generally recognizes a greater need to disseminate factual works than works of fiction or fantasy .... [and][t]he scope of fair use is also narrower with respect to unpublished works."  Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 563, 564, 105 S.Ct. at 2232, 2232.   Because Blood of My Blood is a creative, unpublished work, the second enquiry weighs in favor of finding Seajay's use unfair.16


54
Appellant argues that the unpublished nature of the Blood of My Blood requires us to reverse the district court.  Indeed the Supreme Court stated that "[u]nder ordinary circumstances, the author's right to control the first public appearance of his undisseminated expression will outweigh a claim of fair use."  Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 555, 105 S.Ct. at 2228.   In 1992, however, Congress amended § 107 to state that:  "The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors."  17 U.S.C.A. § 107.17  Thus, while the fact that Blood of My Blood was unpublished militates against a finding of "fair use," it does not foreclose a finding that Seajay's use was fair.


55
Appellant also urges reversal because the dissemination by Seajay denies the Foundation its power to decide not to publish Blood of My Blood at all.  Harper & Row clearly recognizes that "[t]he right of first publication encompasses ... the choice whether to publish at all...."  471 U.S. at 564, 105 S.Ct. at 2232.   The Foundation is correct in its statement that usurping the copyright holder's privilege to determine whether or not to publish Blood of My Blood would favor a finding of unfair use.  This argument presupposes, however, that the purpose or effect of the allegedly infringing uses was to supplant the Foundation's right to publish Blood of My Blood.   As discussed above, we have found that neither the purpose nor the effect of any of the challenged copies amounted to a first publication of Blood of My Blood.   Thus, we hold that while the unpublished nature of Blood of My Blood weighs against a finding of fair use, the allegedly infringing copies have not stripped from the Foundation its right to determine whether or not to publish Rawlings' first work at all.


56
For the aforementioned reasons, the nature of the copyrighted work weighs in favor of finding Seajay's use to have been unfair under 17 U.S.C.A. § 107.


57
iii. Amount and Substantiality of Copied Portion


58
The third statutory factor addresses the amount and substantiality of the portion copied by the alleged infringer in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole.  17 U.S.C.A. § 107(3).  "[T]his factor calls for thought not only about the quantity of the materials used, but about their quality and importance, too."  Campbell, 510 U.S. at 587, 114 S.Ct. at 1175.   Thus, this factor has favored copyright holders where a significant percentage of the copyrighted work was copied, or where the percentage was not great, but the copied portion essentially was the "heart" of the copyrighted work.  Wright, 953 F.2d at 738 (citations and internal quotations omitted).


59
a. Quality


60
No evidence was admitted as to the value of the copied material in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole.  We could presume that because Blythe chose to quote it, the material copied necessarily must be the "heart of the work," however, we decline to do so.  Obviously, the quoted material is of significant value, or it would not have been quoted.  All quoted material is of significant value, but it cannot be said to be the "heart of the work" or the fair use doctrine would be destroyed.  See Religious Technology Center v. Lerma, 908 F.Supp. 1362, 1367 (E.D.Va.1995).  If all quoted material were deemed significant enough to preclude a fair use just because it was significant enough to be quoted, no one could ever quote copyrighted material without fear of being sued for infringement.  Thus, we find that the quoted portions are undoubtedly significant, but fall short of being the "heart of the work," and thus weighing in favor of a finding of unfair use.


61
b. Quantity


62
"There are no absolute rules as to how much of a copyrighted work may be copied and still be considered a fair use."  Maxtone-Graham, 803 F.2d at 1263.   In analyzing this factor, we must consider material copied from the copyrighted work, whether it has been quoted verbatim or paraphrased.  Salinger v. Random House, 811 F.2d 90, 97 (2d Cir.1987).  Copying an entire work weighs against finding a fair use, Advanced Computer Servs. v. MAI Sys. Corp., 845 F.Supp. 356, 365 (E.D.Va.1994), however, it does not preclude a finding of fair use.  Id. at 366 (citations omitted).  "[T]he extent of permissible copying varies with the purpose and character of the use."  Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586-87, 114 S.Ct. at 1175.18


63
Obviously, the copies of Blood of My Blood provided to Blythe and the University of Florida Library were qualitatively and quantitatively substantial.  Nonetheless, when the extent of the copying is considered with the purpose and character of the uses, the amount and substance of the copies are justified.  See Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586-87, 114 S.Ct. at 1175-76.   In order for Blythe to perform her scholarly criticism of the novel, she obviously needed access to either the original or an entire copy.  Similarly, in order for the Library to authenticate Blood of My Blood as being Rawlings' work, to determine whether the work was worthy for publication, and to obtain the necessary permission from the copyright holder, it too needed either the original or a nearly complete copy.  It would severely restrict scholarly pursuit, and inhibit the purposes of the Copyright Act, if a fragile original could not be copied to facilitate literary criticism.  Thus, we find that the amount and substantiality of the portion of Blood of My Blood copied for Blythe and the Library did not exceed the amount necessary to accomplish these legitimate purposes.  See Supermarket of Homes, Inc. v. San Fernando Valley Bd. of Realtors, 786 F.2d 1400, 1409 (9th Cir.1986).


64
As to Blythe's paper, she quoted between four and six percent of Blood of My Blood.   In addition, she paraphrased substantially from the work.  As with the copies provided to Blythe and the Library, the propriety of the amount quoted and paraphrased by Blythe must be analyzed in consideration of the purpose and character of the allegedly infringing use.  Here, Blythe was performing a scholarly criticism of Rawlings' initial work.  It seems apparent that a scholarly criticism of a book will require the critic to quote and paraphrase from the work it is analyzing.  See Supermarket of Homes, 786 F.2d at 1408 ("A common type of 'fair use' is quotation of a passage in a book review.");  Robert Stigwood Group Ltd. v. O'Reilly, 346 F.Supp. 376, 385 (D.Conn.1972) (recognizing that critical review of another's work can be a fair use and that critics may quote extensively from the copyrighted work "in order to comment effectively").  Additionally, as the district court held, the amount quoted by Blythe is well within allowable limits as found by other courts.  See New Era Publications Int'l, ApS v. Carol Publ'g Group, 904 F.2d 152, 158 (2d Cir.)  (fair use defense available where defendant quoted minuscule amount from 25 works, between 5 and 6 percent of 12 works and 8 percent or more of 11 short works), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 921, 111 S.Ct. 297, 112 L.Ed.2d 251 (1990);  Maxtone-Graham, 803 F.2d at 1263 (quoting 4.3 percent of copyrighted work not incompatible with finding of fair use).  Thus, we find that no more of the text was quoted or paraphrased than was necessary for Blythe to adequately criticize and comment upon Blood of My Blood.


65
For the aforementioned reasons, the amount and substantiality of the portion copied by Seajay weigh in favor of finding the uses fair under 17 U.S.C.A. § 107.


66
iv. Market Effect


67
The final statutory enquiry considers the effect the allegedly infringing use has upon the market for, or value of, the copyrighted work.  17 U.S.C.A. § 107(4).  This fourth factor "is undoubtedly the single most important element of fair use."  Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 566, 105 S.Ct. at 2233.


68
a. Impair Marketability


69
A use that does not materially impair the marketability of the copyrighted work generally will be deemed fair.  Advanced Computer Services, 845 F.Supp. at 366 (citing Sony, 464 U.S. at 450-51, 104 S.Ct. at 792-93;  Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 566-67, 105 S.Ct. at 2233-34;  N.A.D.A. Servs.  Corp. v. Business Data of Virginia, Inc., 651 F.Supp. 44, 48 (E.D.Va.1986)).  The only evidence presented at trial as to the market effect of the allegedly infringing uses was that, despite the Blythe presentation and the copies to Blythe and the Library, the University of Florida Press still wanted to publish Blood of My Blood.   Based on this evidence, the district court held that the uses made by Seajay did not diminish the potential market for, or value of, Blood of My Blood.


70
This finding of fact was not clearly erroneous.  The copy provided to Blythe was seen only by Blythe;  the copy provided to the University of Florida was seen only by Mr. Roger Tarr, an associate of Baskin, and representatives of University of Florida Press;  the presentation by Blythe was seen by between 150 and 200 members of the Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings Society, the editor of the Society's Symposium, and an editor for the University Press.  Thus, it is reasonable for the district court to have concluded that the allegedly infringing activities did not have a negative impact on the market for, or value of, Blood of My Blood.   In fact, it is likely that Blythe's presentation stimulated interest in Blood of My Blood among the Society's members and may actually have increased demand for it.  See Maxtone-Graham, 803 F.2d at 1264.


71
b. Market Substitute


72
Another key element of the fourth enquiry is whether the allegedly infringing work is a market substitute for the copyrighted work.  As the Supreme Court stated, "the role of the courts in determining fair use is to distinguish between '[b]iting criticism [that merely] suppresses demand [and] copyright infringement[, which] usurps it.' "  Campbell, 510 U.S. at 592, 114 S.Ct. at 1178 (quoting Fisher v. Dees, 794 F.2d 432, 438 (9th Cir.1986)).  The fair use doctrine protects against a republication which offers the copyrighted work "in a secondary packaging," where "potential customers, having read the secondary work, will no longer be inclined to purchase again something they have already read."  New Era Publications Int'l, ApS v. Henry Holt & Co., Inc., 695 F.Supp. 1493 (S.D.N.Y.1988), aff'd, 873 F.2d 576 (2d Cir.1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1094, 110 S.Ct. 1168, 107 L.Ed.2d 1071 (1990).  The doctrine does not protect against criticism which may have an adverse market effect.  Id.


73
This analysis harkens back to our discussion of § 107(1).  As we held then, Blythe's paper was transformative;  it did not amount to mere duplication of the original, and did not have the purpose or effect of supplanting the copyrighted work.  It did not serve as a market replacement for Blood of My Blood, rather it served as a criticism of and comment about Blood of My Blood.   This holding is reinforced by the University of Florida Press' willingness to publish Blood of My Blood despite Blythe's presentation.  Accordingly, we hold that since Blood of My Blood and Blythe's criticism of Blood of My Blood serve different market functions, Blythe's paper is not a market substitute for the original work.19


74
c. Derivative Markets


75
A final element of the fourth factor is the impact the allegedly infringing uses may have on the market for derivatives of the copyrighted work.  Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 568, 105 S.Ct. at 2234-35.   The market for potential derivatives includes those uses that the copyright holder of the original work would develop or license others to develop.  Campbell, 510 U.S. at 592, 114 S.Ct. at 1178.   As the Supreme Court declared, however, "there is no protectible derivative market for criticism."  Id. If there were a protectible derivative market for critical works, copyright holders would only license to those who would render favorable comment.  The copyright holder cannot control the dissemination of criticism.  See New Era, 695 F.Supp. at 1523 (fair use protection is not "accorded only to favorable critics").  Thus, Seajay's allegedly infringing uses could not impact the market for derivatives of Blood of My Blood.


76
For the aforementioned reasons, the effect Seajay's uses have on the market for, or value of, Blood of My Blood  weighs in favor of finding the uses fair under 17 U.S.C.A. § 107.


77
v. Aggregation of Four Factors


78
An analysis of the four statutory factors leads us to agree with the district court that Seajay's uses of the original manuscript of Blood of My Blood were permissible under the "fair use" exception to copyright infringement.

B. Claim for Injunctive Relief

79
The district court held that the alleged threats of illegal duplication contained in the letter of September 13, 1989 did not constitute threats at all.  Instead, the lower court held that the letter merely requested permission to publish Blood of My Blood.   The court noted that letters dated January 29, 1990;  July 3, 1990;  and August 16, 1990 supported its factual determination.  A review of those letters shows ample support for the district court's factual finding.  Accordingly, there was no threat of future dissemination of Blood of My Blood, and the district court properly denied the Foundation's request for an injunction.

IV. CONCLUSION

80
For the reasons contained herein, we affirm the judgment of the district court.


81
AFFIRMED.



1
 It is important to note the distinction between the physical ownership of documents, and the ownership of the literary rights in those documents, the later being the copyright.  Under 17 U.S.C.A. § 202 (West 1996), the physical document and the copyright are subject to separate transfer.  Count I concerns the right to physical possession of the documents themselves, while Count II concerns the ownership of the literary rights in the documents.  Seajay concedes that the Foundation owns the copyright to Ms. Rawlings' letters and papers, however, it contends that it did not infringe upon those literary rights


2
 Seajay filed a counterclaim seeking a declaration that their uses of the contested documents prior to February 21, 1991 did not constitute publication sufficient to warrant an extension of the Foundation's copyright under 17 U.S.C.A. § 303.  Appellants apparently do not appeal this ruling


3
 The term "literary executrix" is somewhat misleading because Bigham never qualified as a fiduciary in any capacity.  Her legal status seems to have been that of an advisor to the executor, Baskin


4
 Appellants allege in Count I that certain of the documents in categories 3 and 4 were owned by Rawlings at the time of her death, and passed to Bigham solely in her role as literary executrix.  They claim that upon Bigham's death, rightful possession of those documents passed to Baskin as the administrator of the estate.  Their claim covers a total of 12 documents from those two categories, including Rawlings' first unpublished novel Blood of My Blood


5
 This copy included all but six pages of the original


6
 The Foundation used a copy of Blood of My Blood obtained in violation of this restriction to register its copyright on June 13, 1990


7
 In Count II, the Foundation claims that the copy of Blood of My Blood made for Blythe;  the copy made for the University of Florida Library;  and the paper written and presented by Blythe, which quoted and substantially paraphrased Blood of My Blood, constitute copyright infringement.  The Foundation also claims that Seajay has threatened to make additional infringing copies of Blood of My Blood.   According to the Foundation, this alleged threat justifies the injunctive relief sought under 17 U.S.C.A. § 502


8
 As noted, the lower court held that the Foundation did not have a possessory interest in the contested documents.  Appellants have not appealed this decision.  Indeed, their entire appeal as to Count I is directed at Baskin's recovery of the contested documents.  Accordingly, appellants have waived any claim by the Foundation for possession of the contested documents.  Therefore, we need only discuss whether Baskin has a viable claim under Count I


9
 Baskin was unable to testify at the trial due to his health.  His deposition testimony and interrogatory responses were admitted into evidence


10
 Baskin not only admitted this in his interrogatory responses and deposition testimony, but in paragraph 14 of the Second Amended Complaint, Baskin alleged that, upon Bigham's failure to complete her duties as literary executrix, the duty passed to him as personal representative of the estate


11
 In paragraph 15 of the Second Amended Complaint, Baskin alleges that as personal representative of Rawlings' estate, the right to possession of all the estate's personal property belonged to him pending the completion of administration of the estate, yet he did not attempt to recover these documents while administration of the estate remained open from 1961 until 1965


12
 Count II is a claim exclusively put forward by the Foundation, as the sole owner of the copyright


13
 This list of permissible uses is not exhaustive and is not intended to single out any particular use as presumptively fair.  Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 561, 105 S.Ct. at 2230-31


14
 "If, indeed, commerciality carried presumptive force against a finding of fairness, the presumption would swallow nearly all of the illustrative uses listed in the preamble paragraph of § 107, including news reporting, comment, criticism, teaching, scholarship and research, since these activities are generally conducted for profit in this country."  Campbell, 510 U.S. at 584, 114 S.Ct. at 1174 (citation and internal quotation omitted) (emphasis added)


15
 In this case, there was no attempt by the defendant to market the copyrighted work ahead of an imminent publication by the copyright holder, as there was in Harper & Row


16
 Even though Blood of My Blood can be characterized as autobiographical, it is still a work of creative expression rather than a presentation of information


17
 Appellants contend that the 1992 amendment to § 107 does not apply in this case because the action commenced in 1990 and the district court reached its initial decision in 1991.  We disagree.  The district court reopened the case for argument in 1996, received additional evidence as to Count II at that time, and entered its findings of fact and conclusions of law in 1997.  Thus, the law at the time of the district court's decision included the 1992 amendment.  In any event, prior to the 1992 amendment, the Supreme Court's statement in Harper & Row did not require a finding of unfair use;  it merely militated against a finding of fair use.  We are of the opinion that the district court's decision should be upheld whether or not the 1992 amendments apply to this case


18
 The more material copied directly from a copyrighted work tends to show a lack of transformative character under the first factor and a greater likelihood of market harm under the fourth factor.  See Campbell, 510 U.S. at 587-88, 114 S.Ct. at 1175-76


19
 We find that, even if widespread, Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 568, 105 S.Ct. at 2234-35, Blythe's presentation would not have superseded Blood of My Blood 's place in the market.  As a scholarly criticism, Blythe's paper is of a different character and delivers a different message than Blood of My Blood.   Thus, it could not be a market substitute for or a competitor with Blood of My Blood

[*1]The People of the State of New York, Respondent,
vMelvin Vidro, Defendant-Appellant.


Richard M. Greenberg, Office of the Appellate Defender, New York (Charity L. Brady of counsel), for appellant.
Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., District Attorney, New York (Samuel Z. Goldfine of counsel), for respondent.

Judgment, Supreme Court, New York County (Arlene D. Goldberg, J.), rendered May 22, 2014, as amended July 22, 2014, convicting defendant, after a jury trial, of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, and sentencing him, as a second felony drug offender previously convicted of a violent felony, to a term of four years, unanimously affirmed.
The court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress physical evidence and the confirmatory identifications made by undercover police officers. The arresting officer had probable cause to arrest defendant under the fellow officer rule because "the radio transmission [of] the undercover officer . . . provided details of the defendant's race, sex, clothing, as well as his location and the fact that a  positive buy' had occurred" and defendant was the only person in the area who matched the description at the location (see People v Young, 277 AD2d 176, 176-177 [1st Dept 2000], lv denied 96 NY2d 789 [2001]). Although the arresting officer did not testify at the suppression hearing, "the only rational explanation for how defendant came to be arrested . . . is that [the arresting officer] heard the radio communication [heard by the testifying officer] and apprehended defendant on that basis" (People v Poole, 45 AD3d 501, 502 [1st Dept 2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 815 [2008] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]; People v Myers, 28 AD3d 373 [1st Dept 2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 760 [2006]). The inference of mutual communication (see People v Gonzalez, 91 NY2d 909, 910 [1998]) does not turn on what kind of radios the officers were using, or how well the radios were working, but on the simple fact that, without hearing the radio transmission, the arresting officer would have had no way of knowing where to go or whom to arrest.
Defendant's challenges to the prosecutor's summation are entirely unpreserved because, during the summation, defendant made only unspecified generalized objections. Although defendant's postsummation mistrial motion made some specific claims, this was insufficient to preserve those issues, which
should have been raised during the summation (see People v Romero, 7 NY3d 911, 912 [2006]; People v LaValle, 3 NY3d 88, 116 [2004]). We decline to review any of defendant's challenges to the summation in the interest of justice.
