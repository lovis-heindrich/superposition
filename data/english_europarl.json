["13. Turkey's 2007 progress report (\n- Before the vote on Amendment 11:\nAlexander Lambsdorff\n(DE) Mr President, we agree with our fellow Members that we should give appropriate recognition to the role of the Kurdish language in Turkey. Paragraph 11 requires some linguistic clarification on one point, however. I would therefore like to propose an oral amendment which has been agreed with the other shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteur. In the amended version, the sentence would therefore read as follows:\n'including real possibilities to learn Kurdish within the public and private schooling system and to use it in broadcasting, in daily life and in access to public services'.\n(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)\n- Before the vote on paragraph 19:\nRia Oomen-Ruijten\nrapporteur. - (NL) We want to drop the word 'neighbouring' because we want the Ombudsman to work with all European ombudsmen and ombudswomen.\n(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)\n", "Protection of minors and human dignity\nPresident.\nThe next item is the report (A5-0037/2002) by Mr Beazley, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the evaluation report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the application of the Council Recommendation of 24 September 1998 concerning the protection of minors and human dignity [COM(2001) 106 - C5-0191/2001 - 2001/2087(COS)].\n\nBeazley (PPE-DE)\nMr President, may I first pay credit to my colleague, Mr Heaton-Harris, for the initial work he did in drafting this report before he moved to another committee.\nThe rapid development of the audio-visual media has brought many real benefits in terms of education, spreading greater awareness of public affairs around the world, and not least in the field of entertainment.\nHowever, along with the undoubted advantages, there have also been concerns that, given the generally greater adeptness of children at using audio-visual resources, in some areas there are dangers of their obtaining access to unsuitable or harmful material. This is most obvious in the fields of overt sexual material and gratuitous violence.\nThe principles which have guided this report are to encourage greater public awareness of these issues and to support parental responsibility and to develop co-operation between the content providers, consumer organisations and the respective authorities, both national and European. Self-regulation is considered to be the main instrument, underpinned by legal requirements where necessary.\nThe report, which analyses the Commission's evaluation report, is primarily concerned with the Internet and with video games, as it was felt important not to anticipate a possible future review of the Television without Frontiers directive. The report calls for user-friendly content filter systems to enable parents to predetermine the sort of content which they feel is unsuitable viewing for their children and, in this rega", "European Constitution and IGC\nPresident. -\nThe next item is the report (A5-0299/2003) by Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado and Mr Tsatsos, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe and the European Parliament's opinion on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) [11047/2003 - C5-0340/2003 - 2003/0902(CNS)].\n\nGil-Robles Gil-Delgado (PPE-DE)\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report Mr Tsatsos and myself have produced is based on very clear political criteria. Firstly, Parliament must support its delegation in the Convention, which has achieved a good text, an intelligent text, although naturally it is not a perfect text, because no legal text is perfect.\nWe do not therefore believe that we need to make proposals to modify this text; we understand that many Members would have liked to have called for improvements on various points, but our approach has been that we should not call for any, but that we should ask the Heads of State or Government not to substantially undo or alter the broad consensus achieved in the Convention.\nWe are not dealing with mere preparatory work, but with an expression of solutions supported by national parliaments and the European Parliament - which represents the citizens of Europe - and by representatives of the governments and the Member States. I repeat: we are dealing with a political consensus which must not be undervalued or sidelined.\nIt is true that, on certain points, ladies and gentlemen, some governments and the Commission have expressed reservations. It would be na\u00efve to imagine that these extremely important political problems are not going to be dealt with by the Intergovernmental Conference, or that that Conference will simply rubberstamp what the Convention has done. Those people who maintain this position are naturally expressing an initial negotiating position because, otherwise, we would have to assume they have their heads in the clouds.\nI", "Question Time (Commission) \nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B7-0563/2010).\nThe following questions are addressed to the Commission.\nSubject: Young people in precarious employment\nAs the Commission notes in its communication 'Youth on the move', young people are often trapped in a chain of temporary employment contracts that reduces their chances of moving on to more stable contracts and exacerbates their job insecurity. The problem is even more acute in Member States where labour law is particularly protectionist. Can the Commission answer the following questions:\nDoes it believe that the often doubtful quality and uncontrolled duration of traineeships exacerbate this problem? Will it take specific action as part of the objectives set in the Europe 2020 strategy and the Youth on the Move programme to support youth employment and strengthen their job security?\nWill the Commission pursue specific and even more targeted policies to promote and strengthen youth employment in those Member States that are facing an economic recession?\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Andor\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, two months ago, the Commission presented the 'Youth on the move' flagship initiative as part of the Europe 2020 strategy. This sends a clear signal that the Commission has a special concern for young people.\n'Youth on the move' has three objectives: to improve education, increase employment and foster mobility for young people across the European Union. It will involve action to make education and training more relevant to young people's needs, encourage them to take advantage of EU grants to study or train in another country and overcome obstacles to entering and making progress in the labour market.\nThe two labour market problems which the honourable Member has raised, namely, traineeships and labour market segmentation, are among the topics 'Youth on the move' takes up. I am grateful for the opportunity to explain the Commission's views and aims regarding these two topics. I", "Improving consumer education and awareness on credit and finance (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Iotova, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on protecting the consumer: improving consumer education and awareness on credit and finance.\nIliana Malinova Iotova\nThe report on financial education which will be put to the vote at tomorrow's plenary session is more important than ever. It is clear that the financial crisis we are now facing can be avoided if consumers are well informed of the risks that various types of credit entail. We can definitely say that if in the past we had concentrated more on the financial education of people, we would not be facing the present situation, or at least the crisis would not have assumed the proportions it has. For the sake of the future we must be sure that our children are given the opportunity to learn and to handle credit cards and loans properly everywhere in Europe. We have to concentrate on student mortgage loans and pension and investment funds. These financial products strongly affect the lives of consumers, which is why they must be taken into consideration. We must not forget that increasing numbers of young people are getting deep into debt without even suspecting what effect this will have on their lives.\nWe have spent many months working very closely on the texts of the report. We conducted a very interesting public discussion with representatives of European and US banks and financial institutions right on the eve of the crisis. Even then the problems had clearly come into focus, and the alarm was sounded. On the other hand, we were able to see the experience and good practice of financial education in countries which have traditions in this area and which are constantly working to improve it - the UK, France, Germany and elsewhere, and we heard the opinions of those who are taking their first steps in this field. I am pleased with the results of", "Public-private partnerships (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Weiler, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on public-private partnerships and Community law on public procurement and concessions.\nBarbara Weiler \nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my gratitude to the representatives of the other groups - Mrs Cederschi\u00f6ld, Mr Lambsdorff, Mrs R\u00fchle - and also to the representatives of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, who had a hand in the production of this report, for we were able to exchange views in a constructive and fair way, and managed, in any case, to achieve agreement on over 140 amendments in committee, so that there remain only 23 to be considered today or tomorrow, although it has to be said that compromises had to be reached in respect of them too.\nWe have tried to strike a balance between two powerful opposing parties - the business associations and the local government associations - which put forward their no doubt legitimate interests in a forceful manner.\nWhat I have to say at the beginning of my speech I wish to address to them. What I want to say to the businessmen is that, despite all that we have heard, I want to make it clear that we in this House take it as self-evident that local authorities should engage in economic activity, and, indeed, that returning certain activities to them is reasonable and legitimate. What I would like to say to the local authorities is that invitations to tender, whether at the national or European level, do not absolutely have to be arbitrary, but offer the transparency that is needed to benefit the public and prevent corruption. I get the impression from the debate that their respective associations did not always see it that way.\nI have attempted, by means of my report, to strike a balance that would secure more guaranteed competition for the private sector and would give th", "Welcome\nPresident\nI would like to welcome Mr Olexander Moroz, President of the Verjovna Rada, the Ukrainian Parliament, who is in the gallery, and the delegation accompanying him.\n(Applause)\nWe wish Mr Moroz a happy stay with us and we hope that he will be able to lead the parliamentary work in his country through the difficult situation it is facing at the moment and towards a democratic, prosperous and stable future in which he will always be able to count on our friendship and support.\nI would also like to welcome to the official gallery a delegation from the Algerian Parliament - headed by Mr Abderrezak Bouhara, Vice-President of the National Council - which is currently visiting our Parliament.\nWe hope that Mr Bouhara's meetings with members of the Delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries, as well as with other Members of this House, will help to strengthen our many links with the Republic of Algeria and will enable us to make progress in the common quest for peace, prosperity and democracy for the countries located on both shores of the Mediterranean.\n(The formal sitting was opened at 12.05 p.m.)\n", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nClemente Mastella\n(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Framework Agreement that we have just adopted considerably improves the role of the European Parliament - a role that has grown thanks to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.\nPresident Barroso, we have given you our confidence, and we expect you for your part to have respect for our greater prerogatives.\nIn particular, we consider it fundamental to collaborate more closely, with the aim of establishing a regular dialogue between the two institutions. We take as a cue the undertakings that you have given in this Chamber, your willingness to institutionalise a regular dialogue on key fundamental questions and on important legislative proposals, and the undertaking you have made to report on the practical follow-up to each legislative initiative request within three months of its adoption.\nMr President, our institutions will be called upon to implement the so-called 'democratic method' by establishing a special partnership with a view to defining, implementing and, above all, safeguarding the true interest of Europe. This is a greater responsibility for the Commission, but also for us, the direct representatives of the citizens of this Europe of ours.\nMr President, all these goals require a greater commitment by all: by the Commission, by Parliament, by national parliaments and by governments. This is the Europe that citizens demand of us and this is the Europe that we must be able to guarantee them over the next five years.\nBernd Posselt\n(DE) Mr President, I have voted in favour of the Commission and I am also in favour of the Framework Agreement, which represents an historic step forward. Despite this, I have voted against the resolution, because we received it yesterday as a finished text and were not able to debate it seriously and because the devil is in the detail. For that reason, I would like to make it clear that I have concerns about the word", "Order of business\nPresident\nThe final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 23 September 2010, pursuant to Rule 140 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed.

We are in favour of this because it is a very complicated topic.\nI understand that the title has changed and that the Liberals have changed their position, but the substance is still very complicated and we still want this to be discussed first in the Committee on Employment, because it is a very important and complicated discussion. We do not want to oppose it, but this is the reason why we will abstain in the vote on this topic.\nPresident\nThank you, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, for your e", "Question Time (Commission) \nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B6-0231/2009).\nThe following questions are addressed to the Commission.\n\nSubject: Competition and transparency of income taxation\nDoes the Commission consider the maintenance of non-transparent systems of income taxation within the European Union to be compatible with free competition and if not, what steps does it intend to take to put a stop to such systems in Member States or parts of Member States?\nAndris Piebalgs\nMember of the Commission. - Let me first recall that Member States are, under Community law, largely free to design their direct tax systems in a way that best meets their domestic policy objectives and requirements. But in recent years they have reached common agreement on several measures proposed by the Commission that are designed to tackle the erosion of tax bases and investment allocation distortions. In doing so, Member States have acknowledged that EU-wide cooperation and fair tax competition rules are vital to protect revenues.\nOn the question of transparency raised by an honourable Member of Parliament, I would like to recall that very recently, on 28 April 2009, the European Commission adopted a communication identifying actions in order to promote good governance in the tax area, which means transparency, exchange of information and fair tax competition.\nFirstly the communication identifies how good governance in the tax area could be improved within the European Union so as to reinforce the argument for other jurisdictions to follow. It calls on Member States to swiftly adopt Commission proposals for directives on administrative cooperation and mutual assistance in the recovery of taxes and savings taxation. Member States should also continue to give appropriate priority to eliminating harmful business tax regimes. More specifically, the Commission's proposal on administrative cooperation contains a provision according to which bank secrecy could no longer be invoked to ", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nEphremidis\nMr President, there is a blatant inaccuracy and, if you will, an injustice. Mr Howitt states that fellow-countrymen of his, lorry drivers, are being prevented from returning home - especially now as Christmas is approaching - by the tractors of farmers who, in their struggle for survival, have blocked off a number of roads. The truth is that whenever those drivers want to get by, they are let through, and not only this, but because there is some disturbance and difficulty about feeding them, special meals are prepared for them so that they can leave and return to their countries as calmly and quietly as possible.\nI therefore ask for correction of that unjust comment against farmers who have been literally struggling for their livelihoods for the last ten days.\n\nPresident\nThe order of business makes no allowance for debate on that subject.\n\nSpencer\nMr President, the Minutes make reference to the somewhat intemperate intervention by Mr Niall Andrews yesterday afternoon concerning the case of Miss McAliskey who is awaiting extradition to Germany, charged with complicity in a mortar attack in Osnabr\u00fcck. Miss McAliskey is currently in an all-women prison - Holloway. She is pregnant and has received full medical check-ups. I can report to the House that her condition is reported to be excellent. She has received extremely good care and I absolutely reject the intemperate comments made by Mr Andrews in his intervention yesterday.\n(Applause )\n\nBlak\nMr President, in connection with what Mr Howitt said yesterday regarding the case in Greece, I can confirm that it is not only English drivers who are hostages in this Greek game. There are also Danish drivers who have been 'imprisoned' and who are receiving unbelievably bad treatment. I would therefore ask you, as a Greek and as a Parliamentary President, to write a letter to the Greek government and de", "Statutes for the Euratom Supply Agency (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Romana Jordan Cizelj, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision establishing Statutes for the Euratom Supply Agency - C6-0131/2007 -.\nFranco Frattini\nVice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on her report.\nNuclear energy is an important component of a European energy policy mix, and today we are witnessing a renewed interest in nuclear energy, both at European and international level.\nThe Euratom Supply Agency has, during its more than 45 years of existence, helped to ensure the supply of nuclear fuels for the benefit of Community users.\nThe Supply Agency is a body which was established by the Euratom Treaty, meaning it stems directly from a primary law instrument. It aims at the long-term security of supply through reasonable diversification of supply sources for nuclear fuels. Equal access to sources of supply is an important element of the Euratom Treaty, and this is ensured by the Supply Agency.\nToday, the Supply Agency operates on statutes from 1958, when the Community consisted of six Member States. The enlargement of the European Union calls for the modernisation of these statutes. This is the purpose of our proposal; this is also why the Supply Agency cannot be considered a new agency within the meaning of the Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament and the European Commission.\nThe European Parliament has long called for the role of the Agency to be revived and for the powers contained in the Euratom Treaty to be used in full. I would, in particular, mention the Maldeikis report on the 50th anniversary of the Euratom Treaty, which this House adopted earlier this year. I am pleased to say that the Commission welcomes most of the amendments proposed. I share your view that the role of the advisory committee needs to be strengthened. I", "Accession of Bulgaria - Accession of Romania (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following reports:\nby Geoffrey Van Orden, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the accession of Bulgaria to the European Union, and\nby Pierre Moscovici, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the accession of Romania to the European Union.\nGeoffrey Van Orden \nrapporteur. - Mr President, Bulgaria applied to join the European Union 11 years ago, in 1995, and negotiations were opened five years later. Since those days we have seen remarkable changes: on the economic front GDP has doubled, foreign investment has increased from less than USD 100 million to over USD 1.7 billion, real wages have increased year on year and unemployment has halved.\nSince the opening of negotiations, we have seen three changes of government, representing a wide range of the political spectrum: from the UDF Government of Ivan Kostov, to the return of former King Simeon to lead his National Movement Government from 2001 to 2005, to the present socialist-led coalition under Sergei Stanishev. All have played a strong part in the reform process, taking forward Bulgaria's progress towards EU accession.\nThis progress has taken place in spite of a very difficult regional situation, with conflict on Bulgaria's borders. The NATO-led operations against Serbia began in March 1999 with air strikes that destroyed the Danube bridges and severed navigation between the upper and lower Danube for two years. In addition to this economic disruption, devastating floods hit parts of Bulgaria in 2005, with many deaths and thousands left homeless.\nThe fact that we saw NATO accession in March 2004 and have now reached the point of EU accession is a tribute to the determination and hard work of so many at all levels and from all shades of government, and no less a tribute to the Bulgarian people. They have seen their country turned over, examined and criticised at an accelerating pace. They", "Common rules for the allocation of slots at Community airports (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Costa, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EEC) No 95/93 on common rules for the allocation of slots at Community airports - C6-0097/2009 -.\nPaolo Costa\nMr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, I have the pleasure of opening this debate with a conclusion, so to speak, by recommending at this time that the House adopt the amendment tabled by myself and all the group representatives within the committee, to conclude this report at first reading and thus obtain approval for the regulation.\nWe do so with a great sense of responsibility. I think Vice-President Tajani will agree that the way in which we have tried to respond to an objective need and difficulty of the airlines at the moment - allowing them to retain their time slots even if they do not use them during the summer season this year - is a necessary, but very rough measure, a measure that needs refining.\nIt needs to be refined because we have seen, in the brief time that discussion has been allowed on this, that there are different interests, all of which are absolutely legitimate, among the airlines, that there are companies waiting to replace others, where the first are unable to meet their commitments, that there are now distinct interests among airlines and airports, something that did not happen only a short time ago, and above all that there are the interests of passengers, most importantly those served by airports and airlines in the outermost regions, who would be at greater risk should the choice of retaining or abolishing slots depend solely on their profitability for the companies concerned.\nThese are all issues that we have been able to touch on very quickly, but which we have laid on the table. Essentially, we also felt we had to deal with the basic problem, tha", "4.

On Monday, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) published its new scientific recommendation for 2004 and has now, unfortunately, been obliged to confirm the disastrous state that cod stocks are in, including in the waters to the west of Scotland, in the eastern English Channel, in the Skagerrak and in the Kattegat.\nICES has now advised that fishing for these four stocks be closed down. This, of course, puts us in a massive dilemma. Can we justify basing our decision solely on ICES\u2019 argument in favour of replenishing stocks, which would result in our having to prohibit not only fishing for cod, but also for a whole range of other fish, and, in due course, in thousands of fishermen facing oblivion? Or could we find a way out by improving our plans for stock recovery, so that, although stocks would recover more slowly and would also involve some elements of uncertainty, fewer fishermen would be forced to abandon their trade? This is certainly a difficult decision, but it is one we will have to take before we can adopt any kind of plan to replenish cod stocks.\nThe outline that we are debating today is a general one, and serves as a good basis for a cod stock recovery plan that would secure us the chance to revert to normal management conditions. It starts by identifying the lower limit below which scientists regard a stock as threatened with collapse. The plan contains formulae for calculating total allowable catches (TAC) on the basis of scientific estimates of current stocks. If the stock is larger than the lower limit, the TAC will be set in such a way that the stock can increase by 30% in the following year. It introduces lim", "Simplification of the CAP (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Richard Ashworth, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on simplification of the CAP -.\nRichard Ashworth\nrapporteur. - Mr President, Commissioner, we are at the very early stages of the debate, which leads up to the common agricultural policy reform post 2012. In this report, I suggested some of the principles which should underlie the reformed common agricultural policy. It is clear that the agricultural industry needs to change. It will need to change in order to reflect both the challenges of the times in which we now live but more the times which are to come.\nThose will be issues such as food security, market volatility, climate change, and the need to adequately meet the expectations for the delivery of public goods. It is clear, therefore, that the common agricultural policy has to change in order to reflect those challenges, but it is also clear that the way we apply the common agricultural policy needs to change.\nIn setting out these principles that should underlie the reformed common agricultural policy, I have deliberately not gone into detail; that will come in later reports. But what I have developed is two main themes. Firstly, that the common agricultural policy needs to be simpler, fairer and more transparent and that, secondly, the culture of the common agricultural policy needs to change, that a future reformed common agricultural policy ought to be more outcome-driven and less burdened with excessive regulation.\nI have highlighted four ways in which we can reduce the bureaucratic burden on farm businesses. Firstly, we should ensure that the requirements made of the industry are proportionate to the risk assessed. Secondly, we could harmonise inspections standards and we should cut out the duplication of inspection standards and procedures required of the industry. Thirdly, there could or should be greater scope for self-certification ", "\nvan Dijk\nMadam President, I would like to speak on a point of order. The Aftonbladet , a Swedish evening newspaper, of 9 January, had an article on its front page which contained three factual errors, two of which could be verified by Parliament. Seventeen Members of this Parliament from six different groups are accused of being involved in Mafia practices, in particular in the drugs Mafia in the European Union. Since a system and unit have been set up to act against such scandalous articles, I would like to ask whether the Swedish Information Bureau has produced a fiche d'alerte about this yet, and whether it has arrived at our unit in this Parliament yet, and what this will result in. Because it is clearly extremely damaging for this Parliament, and moreover complete nonsense that seventeen members are accused of playing a role in the drugs Mafia, and that they appear in the paper, with pictures and so on. I would like to know whether you, or the unit which was set up to deal with these things, will take action against it, and whether a fiche d'alerte has been issued.\n\nPresident\nMrs Van Dijk, to answer the question you have just asked me, I can say that the Bureau did in fact consider, at yesterday evening's meeting, how best to counter this type of accusation or aspersion and that we decided in principle to set up a rapid rebuttal unit, to counter such absolutely inadmissible, unacceptable attacks as effectively as possible. And I would like to take this opportunity of informing the whole House of this.\n\nCornelissen\nMadam President, my sincerest apologies for bothering you with a personal problem. I tend to start the monthly part-session in Strasbourg in good cheer and in good physical condition, but practically every part-session I end up catching a hefty cold.

The debate occurs at a time when growing international attention is being paid to Iraq, and the situation is one about which practically all the media are speculating on a daily basis, this morning too, as we have no doubt all seen.\nIt is important to emphasise that the EU and the countries of Europe do not have any quarrel with the Iraqi people. Historically, Iraq has contributed to the region in many ways, and the Iraqi refugees who at present live in Europe mostly make positive contributions to the countries in which they live.\nIn 1990, the Iraqi regime chose, however, to invade the small defenceless neighbouring country of Kuwait. A broad coalition of countries from all around the world stood shoulder to shoulder in repelling this aggression.\nAfter the international community, headed by the United States, had liberated Kuwait, Iraq agreed to a ceasefire involving a list of conditions aimed at ending the war over Kuwait. Iraq agreed, among other things, to give up all its weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles. As soon as the UN is able to confirm that Iraq has complied with its obligations to destroy existing stocks of weapons of mass destruction and to stop developing new weapons of this kind, it will be possible to lift the sanctions.\nUnfortunately, the Iraqi regime has chosen over the last 12 years not to cooperate fully in phasing out the country's weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles.\nIn 1991, the UN Security Council set up its first commission of inquiry, UNSCOM (United Nations Special Commission), which was offered completely unacceptable working conditions by the Iraqi regime, culminating in the regime's refusal, in 1998, to give UNSCOM further access to Iraqi territory.

I believe this could also be of assistance to the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.\n(The oral amendment was accepted)\n- Before the vote on paragraph 30:\nDaniel Caspary\n(DE) Mr President, there is no objection to postponing the text, but I would still ask that we hold a vote on it. If Parliament votes in favour of the text, the text belongs elsewhere, but it could be that it is not endorsed, which is why I am asking for a vote on the original text.\nPresident\nThere has been no request for a split vote.\n- After the final vote:\nJan Andersson\n(SV) Mr President, Parliament has now voted in favour of updating and amending the Integrated Guidelines. This concerns, for example, the social dimension. So far the Commission has chosen not to pay attention to this.\nI would like to hear Mr \u0160pidla's comm", "3. Burma\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Burma .\nV\u00e9ronique De Keyser\nMr President, the situation in Burma continues to deteriorate. Do we need to recall the abuses by the Burmese government towards its people, the interminable imprisonment of the Sakharov Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi and her eviction on the false grounds of condemning the forthcoming elections?\nThe Burmese government has promised a democratic transition in seven stages, ultimately leading up to elections. However, if these elections are held in keeping with a constitution drawn up by the army, as would appear to be the case, the only thing they will do will be to legitimise five decades of military regime and give the army 25% of the parliamentary seats. We call on the international community, including China, India and Russia, to continue to combine their efforts and exert pressure on the Burmese government, both so that it stops the serious human rights violations committed in this country and so that the democratic transition announced does not turn into a political farce.\nFilip Kaczmarek\nMr President, the announcement, in any country, of the first elections to be held for 20 years usually fills us with optimism. It awakens hope for the introduction of change and for democratisation. Unfortunately, probably not many of us, and not many of the residents of Burma, believe the elections which are to take place there at the end of this year will be democratic and honest, or will bring about real change. The Burmese regime is a problem we have struggled with for years. In our resolution, we condemn numerous violations of human rights and civil liberties, which are everyday events in Burma. We still do not know what to say to the people of Burma about how to end the regime's ruthless deeds. In my opinion, only joint action can bring results. Joint - whom do I have in mind? Who should take action? Neighbouring countries? The countries which have a lot of trade an", "Formal sitting - Mid-term address by Jerzy Buzek, President of Parliament\nPresident\nColleagues, I have a short speech, as I promised you one year ago.\nWe are at the mid-way point of my Presidency. At the very beginning, I promised that I would inform you of my activities.\nAs the President of the European Parliament, I represent all of you. Wherever I go, whatever I do, I have always felt the honour and responsibility of acting on behalf of this prestigious Chamber.\nBut this speech is not about me: this speech is about you and about your activity. It is about all of us, what we have achieved together at the European Parliament in the last 15 months, and what is ahead of us.\n", "Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting\nPresident.\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed. Are there any comments?\n\nTurco (NI).\nMr President, yesterday, when Mr Cappato asked for information on whether a motion for a resolution signed by 10% of the Members of Parliament was going to be included in the agenda of the Conference of Presidents, Vice?President Schmid announced that a response would be given that afternoon. I would remind you that I started to refuse liquids as of 5 p.m. yesterday evening, having been on a hunger strike for 24 hours already, for precisely this reason: the motion for a resolution in question has already been withheld once from debate by the political body. I now hope that you will find the time to restore the dignity of the political body and allow it to do its job.\n\nPresident.\nMr Turco, I will consult the Conference of Presidents at its meeting on Thursday on this question.\n\nTurchi (UEN).\nMr President, I would like to point out a linguistic problem concerning Amendment No 11 to my report, which was put to the vote yesterday. Out of respect for grammar and the institutions, the amendment should read as follows: 'The financial framework for the implementation of this Regulation for the period 2000 to 2006 shall be EUR 4700 million and shall be subject to a mid-term review based on the implementation of this Regulation?. The rest of the amendment remains as before.\n\nPresident.\nI understand that matter is already being taken care of by the services.\n(The Minutes were approved)\nSakellariou (PSE).\nMr President, a delegation from the democratically elected parliament of Taiwan visited us here in Strasbourg yesterday at the invitation of Members of the European Parliament.

Last night our guests had to leave in haste becaus", "Management of H1N1 influenza (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Rivasi, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on evaluation of the management of H1N1 influenza in the EU in 2009-2010.\nMich\u00e8le Rivasi\nMr President, we all remember that H1N1 influenza was big news in 2009. The first cases were reported almost two years ago - on 25 March 2009 - and the WHO declared a phase 6 alert level on 11 June 2009.\nThis maximum alert level issued by the WHO triggered a series of measures in Europe, including the activation of immunisation campaigns in several Member States which not only were very costly but were also overestimated in relation to the known severity of the virus, which, as the WHO stated at that time in May 2009, was moderate.\nAs regards severity, up to the end of April 2010, this flu had caused around 2 900 deaths in Europe, in other words, a much lower mortality rate than that related to seasonal flu, which causes an estimated 40 000 - 220 000 deaths per year depending on the year.\nMeanwhile, the estimated costs were close to EUR 1.3 billion in the United Kingdom and over EUR 700 million in France according to the latest Court of Auditors report.\nThe evaluation of the management of H1N1 influenza shows that there was a disproportionate response in the European Union and the Member States. I and my colleagues, whom I would like to thank for their amendments, have therefore tried to produce a constructive report which aims to restore the confidence of European citizens in their health institutions.\nThe report is structured around three major themes: cooperation, transparency and independence.\nIn terms of cooperation, we are keen to stress the need for coherence, effectiveness, autonomy and flexibility. Future flu prevention plans, for example, must be revised in such a way as to guarantee greater coherence and effectiveness and must be made self-contained and flexible enough that they can be ada", "Information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Dumitriu, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 3/2008 on information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries - C6-0313/2008 -.\nConstantin Dumitriu\nI am pleased that we have this opportunity to debate in a plenary session an issue which is important not only for the Community's agricultural sector, but also for the European economy's competitiveness as a whole.\nAt a time when the economies of our countries are suffering as a result of the global crisis and when increasing the demand for agricultural products is an imperative, amending Regulation No 3/2008 on information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries offers us additional leverage to support agricultural producers and, by extension, the EU economy.\nEuropean Council Regulation No 3/2008, which combines in a single text regulations 2702/1999 and 2826/2000, has accommodated the European Commission's new political approaches on simplifying legislation, while also achieving the objective of facilitating administrative procedures within the European institutions. Based on this regulation, the Community can take information provision measures for a certain number of agricultural products on the internal market and on the markets of third countries, while also preserving the specific nature of the measures, according to the market in which they are implemented.\nThis policy provides a response to a real need on the part of Member States to promote the image of their agricultural products, especially the benefits in terms of quality, nutritional value and food safety standards, both among European consumers and consumers in other countries. It also helps open up new market ", "Internet of Things (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Maria Badia i Cutchet, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the Internet of Things -.\nMaria Badia i Cutchet\nMadam President, Commissioner, to be honest I do not think I am going to use my four minutes, because at this time of night and with so many Members present, there is no need to give a lengthy explanation. I would, however, like to say that this is a report on a subject that is going to completely revolutionise the relationship between people and things, and between things and things in the next 10 or 15 years: a new application of the Internet.\nI would like to applaud the communication drawn up by the Commission and its timely presentation, because it is about the fact that we can foresee some of the consequences of this new application, which have many benefits. They could improve many aspects of our lives and open up opportunities for new businesses and improvements in production.\nThey do, however, obviously have risks. With regard to the report, on which I worked with the shadow rapporteurs from other political groups, whom I thank for their work, our intention was for users to have all the security and privacy that they want when using these new technologies. We have been looking at whether the legal framework covered all the possibilities opened up by these new applications, and currently it appears to do so, but what was decided was that there should be continuous evaluation. As these applications are being incorporated into the different aspects of our lives, they need to be evaluated in order to ensure that users really have their privacy and security protected, from the point of view of health but also from the point of view of privacy and many other issues.\nI think that this a good approach. This is only the beginning. Perhaps, aside from what the report says, Commissioner, we should think about how to inform users properly so that they reall", "Conclusions of the European Council meeting (24-25 March 2011) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by the President of the European Council: Conclusions of the European Council meeting (24-25 March 2011). The President of the European Council, Mr Van Rompuy, will take the floor.\nHerman Van Rompuy\nPresident of the European Council. - Mr President, President of the European Commission, honourable Members, within the space of 49 days, I have chaired 3 meetings of the European Council and a Summit of Heads of State and Government of the eurozone. These facts illustrate the great and urgent challenges our Union is facing, both on the economic and on the diplomatic front. It also neatly illustrates that meetings of the European Council are not just an event: they are part of a process. Indeed, in the meeting on which I am reporting today - that of 24 and 25 March - we duly approved a significant set of economic measures that have been prepared and discussed over the last year, we stepped up our action with regard to ongoing events in Libya and we initiated our response to the catastrophic events in Japan. Allow me to take each of those issues in turn.\nOn economic issues, we took forward a comprehensive package of measures. Under the impulse of earlier meetings, including the informal eurozone summit of 11 March, we were able to bring together almost all the strengths of this endeavour. Of course, approving measures and procedures to deal with the crisis does not in itself take you immediately out of the crisis. This will require perseverance and sustained effort. I will not repeat all the decisions we took in detail. You will find them in the conclusions. However, let me summarise six key points.\nNumber one: we agreed on the Treaty amendment needed to give full legal certainty to the permanent Stability Mechanism. In its resolution of 15 December, Parliament called for a light Treaty change that provides a legal basis for such a mechanism, rather than resor", "Voting time\nPresident\nFirst of all, following an incident this morning in the Chamber, Mr Schulz wishes to make a personal statement.\nMartin Schulz\n(DE) Mr President, during the debate on the European Council here this morning there was an incident that I do not wish to go into again, because I was the target of an insult. However, I will say this: there are levels at which I cannot be insulted and where I do not see it as an insult either, because in order to insult me, someone must have a certain degree of sincerity. However, I would like to express my sincere thanks for the numerous signs of solidarity that I have since received in this House. I would very much like to thank my fellow Members from all groups. That is a sign of the common, democratic and pro-European conviction that the overwhelming majority of this House shares. I would like to thank you very sincerely for this.\n(Sustained applause)\nPresident\nThe incident referred to was a protest by Mr Bloom, in which he addressed wartime allusions to Mr Schulz. The President said this was unacceptable and invited Mr Bloom to apologise. Mr Bloom did not apologise then. I call on him now to do so. If he does not do so, he must leave the Chamber.\n(Loud applause)\nGodfrey Bloom\nMr President, yet again there is one rule for Herr Schulz and one rule for everybody else. This is a disgrace. I have been elected - re-elected - to vote in this Chamber by the people of Yorkshire (your own constituency, I might add), with a democratic mandate which you yourself do not enjoy, Mr President, because you switched parties and they voted for the Conservatives. I have no intention of apologising, I have no intention of leaving this Chamber: you must have me escorted out, Sir!\nPresident\nMr Bloom, first of all, I was expelled by the Conservative Party for making a stand on a point of principle closely related to the issues you raised this morning.\n(Applause)\nSecondly, you have not apologised for language which was wholly inappropriat", "\n\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013 The next item is the report (A6-0112/2005) by Mrs\u00a0Fraga Est\u00e9vez, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation concerning management measures for the sustainable exploitation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean Sea and amending Regulations (EEC) No\u00a02847/93 and (EC) No 973/2001 [COM(2003)0589 \u2013 C5-0480/2003 \u2013 2003/0229(CNS)]. \nJoe Borg,\n\u00a0\u00a0 . Mr President, let me express the Commission's any my personal satisfaction with the method and the quality of the work done to tackle the challenge of developing adequate management measures for our Mediterranean fisheries.\nIt could not be taken for granted that the deadlock on this matter during the term of the previous European Parliament could be overcome. The proactive attitude of this Parliament, along with a general awareness of the state of fisheries resources and marine ecosystems in the Mediterranean, has contributed to the achievement of a sound compromise. Members of the European Parliament have shown their ability to listen to the spectrum of views that have been voiced on this important question. Parliament's opinion, which I hope will be adopted today, is a good starting point for the work to be carried out in the Council and I hope that the European institutions will be able to deliver the new regulation shortly, in the interests of our fishermen and of fisheries and the marine environment of the Mediterranean.\nThe Commission is very pleased with the close cooperation of the rapporteur, Mrs Fraga Est\u00e9vez, and the members of the Committee on Fisheries during our work on this important proposal.\nI am happy to be able to inform you that we can accept 22 of the 34 amendments tabled by the Committee on Fisheries and other Members. Nine amendments of the 22 accepted, and in particular Amendments 2, 10, 11, 13, 20, 21, 22, 25 and 26 were part of a compromise package agreed with the rapporteur and approved by the Committee on Fisheries.\nThe compromise is not perfe", "Parliament's estimates of revenue and expenditure for the financial year 2010 (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Ma\u0148ka, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the estimates of revenue and expenditure of Parliament for the financial year 2010.\nVladim\u00edr Ma\u0148ka\nrapporteur. - (SK) In my meetings with European Parliament secretary-general Klaus Welle I noted from the outset the efforts he made to resolve problems. I applaud his attempt to optimise the work of the European Parliament's administration, which is an institution employing 6 000 people. I noted a similar commitment and positive approach in negotiations with representatives of the European Parliament's various directorates-general.\nIn some areas savings have already been identified and improvements proposed. One example of this would be the action plan of the Directorate-General for the Presidency relating to security services, which can bring savings in Brussels, Strasbourg and Luxembourg amounting to EUR 2.6 million a year with no negative impact on security and protection.\nMost expenditure items and main projects in the European Parliament budget are of a multiannual nature. I firmly believe that if we improve medium-term budget planning and increase its transparency we will achieve efficiencies. Ladies and gentlemen, the report I am presenting today, which has been approved by the Committee on Budgets, clearly shows that we would like to leave more room for manoeuvre for the new Parliament. If the Committee on Budgets identified savings or reduced certain items we did not begin working on them at this stage just in order to appear tough or to launch a round of in-fighting with the administration and the Presidency on one side and the Committee on Budgets on the other. Our common aim is to obtain a professional and comprehensive summary of the issue and based on this to take the right decision. In the area of workforce planning the Committee on Budgets is bearing in mind proposals and ch", "Commission action plan towards an integrated internal control framework (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is a short presentation of the report by Mrs Stauner, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the Commission action plan towards an integrated internal control framework.\nGabriele Stauner\nMadam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the principle of effective internal control is one of the most important budgetary principles that the Commission must observe when implementing the budget and utilising the funds. The European Court of Auditors (ECA) and the European Parliament have been calling for effective, efficient control of the budgetary resources for years, and numerous attempts and suggestions have been made by the ECA, in particular, seeking to ensure that the Commission uses these resources appropriately and economically. Nevertheless, the ECA has not been able to give the Commission a positive statement of assurance for years. I need only remind the House of the occurrences in connection with irregularities in the implementation of the Leonardo programme a few years ago, and other support areas that have always been very susceptible to irregularities and perhaps even to fraud.\nIn January 2006, the Commission adopted an action plan towards an integrated internal control framework, again with the aim of obtaining a positive statement of assurance from the ECA. As stated in our report, there is no doubt that the Commission has made some serious efforts to develop the action plan. However, it is quite clear to Parliament that the implementation of the measures is a long way behind schedule. Therefore, the Commission must speed up the implementation of the envisaged measures considerably so that positive effects can be seen in the ECA's Annual Report in the foreseeable future and also so that we Members of the European Parliament can grant a budget discharge with a clear conscience.\nI do not want to go into the details of the s", "\n\nAntonio Tajani (PPE-DE ).\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013 Madam\u00a0President, ladies and gentlemen, I should just like to inform Parliament that, this morning, a few kilometres from Kabul, there has been a terrorist attack in which an Italian soldier has been killed and another two European soldiers \u2013 two Italian soldiers \u2013 have been seriously injured and have been admitted to Kabul hospital.\nI believe that it is only right that we express our solidarity with these women and men who are involved in the peace missions in Afghanistan, Iraq and Lebanon. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 I am much obliged to you, Mr\u00a0Tajani. We will pass that on to the President, who, I am sure, will cause those things to be done that need to be done. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is the report (A6-0275/2006) by Mr\u00a0Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission White Paper on services of general interest (2005/2101(INI)). \nBernhard Rapkay (PSE ),\n\u00a0\u00a0 . \u2013 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President of the Commission, having the President of the Commission present for a debate on an own-initiative report is not an everyday occurrence, for an own-initiative report is not exactly an outstanding event when what we are actually meant to be doing is making laws \u2013 although I shall turn to that in a moment. What your presence here demonstrates is that the Commission is clear in its own mind about how important this issue is in the eyes of the public, and hence, too, in those of the citizens\u2019 representatives here in this House.\nIt is for that reason that I would like to refer back to a previous President of the Commission, and not just any old President, but Jacques Delors, who, a few months ago, addressing a meeting of the Committee of the Regions, attempted to place services of general interest in the context of the project of European integration. He told the Committee of the Regions that the work of European integration took three principles as its frame of reference: solidarity, which brings p", "Fight against breast cancer in the European Union (written declaration): see Minutes\nPresident\nWritten Declaration number 0071/2009, submitted by Members Elizabeth Lynne, Michail Tremopoulos, L\u00edvia J\u00e1r\u00f3ka and Lidia Joanna Geringer de Oedenberg, on the fight against breast cancer in the European Union, has been signed by over half of Parliament's Members. Consequently, in accordance with Rule 123 of the Rules of Procedure, it will be forwarded to its addressees and published together with other texts adopted in plenary on 24 February 2010. The names of the signatories will be published in the Minutes of the sitting.\nElizabeth Lynne\nMr President, I should just like to thank everybody for signing Written Declaration 71 on breast cancer.\nMost of you know that this is the leading cause of death across the EU of women aged between 35 and 59, and we want Member States to set up nationwide screening programmes and breast cancer specialist units among other things.\nI hope that the signing of this written declaration will be another step forward to help to make sure that we have EU-wide action to stop the dire consequences of breast cancer.\nPresident\nI would like to thank our fellow Member, as well as all of you who signed this declaration.\n", "Welcome\nPresident\nI would also like to say a word of welcome to a delegation from Iraq. It is a cause of great joy to me to be able to welcome as guests of this Parliament, this afternoon, a delegation of five members of the Parliament of Iraq, led by Mr Hamid Mousa.\n(Applause)\nThe situation in Iraq is a matter of constant concern to us, and a visit by our counterparts there, which gives us the opportunity to learn at first hand about how things are developing there, is both very necessary and welcome. I have already had the opportunity to meet them - I did so yesterday - and I am very well aware of the extremely difficult conditions under which their parliament's members have to work. I am sure that their talks with the Committee on Foreign Affairs and with other Members of this House were useful and will prove beneficial to both sides. I trust that the ongoing process of constitutional reform will offer all groups in Iran the opportunity to reach broad consensus on the essential issues and to prepare a way for their country to move forward into the future.\nI wish you, our honoured guests, and your country, all the best, and hope that your visit will help to forge solid parliamentary relations between our two Houses - your parliament in Iraq and this, the European Parliament. My best wishes go with you as you return to your suffering country.\n", "\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 16 March 2006. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Before we look at the agenda, I must tell you of some news which is positive for once: a positive piece of news relating to a situation in Spain, but one which I believe is good for the whole of Europe.\nI am referring to the communiqu\u00e9 issued today by ETA, announcing a permanent ceasefire.\nWe are being offered a glimpse of a future without terrorism. This is a time to act calmly and prudently. It is also a time to remember the victims of terrorism, and there have been many. It is a time for hope, for the uniting of all democratic political forces. I would say again that this is good news not just for Spanish society, but for the whole of Europe, because it shows that terrorism can be fought through the power of democracy.\nThank you for your applause, ladies and gentlemen.\nWould the political groups like to speak following this communication from the Presidency? \nMartin Schulz,\n\u00a0\u00a0 Mr President, as you can imagine, the information you have given this House has provoked a lively response within our Group today. One of the 200 members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is herself a victim of ETA terrorism, since her husband was murdered by ETA. I hope you will agree to my asking my colleague Mrs\u00a0D\u00fchrkop D\u00fchrkop to say a few words on behalf of our Group.\nB\u00e1rbara D\u00fchrkop D\u00fchrkop,\n\u00a0\u00a0 . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ETA\u2019s announcement of a permanent ceasefire, which has been confirmed, is extremely hopeful news for all of the citizens of Spain and hence for all of the citizens of Europe.\nWe would call for unity amongst all European democrats now and in the future, in order to achieve a definitive peace.\nAs you have said, Mr President \u2014 and I say this with profound emotion \u2014 this is a time to remember the victims.\nHans-Gert Poettering,\n\u00a0\u00a0 Mr President, our highly respected fellow Member Mrs D\u00fchrkop\u2019s concluding remarks would also ha", "Adaptation of a number of instruments to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, \"omnibus\" Regulation, Part One - Adaptation of a number of instruments with regard to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, \"omnibus\" Regulation, Part Three (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on\nthe report by Mr Sz\u00e1jer, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council adapting a number of instruments subject to the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty to Council Decision 1999/468/EC, as amended by Decision 2006/512/EC, with regard to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny - Part One - C6-0432/2007 -; and\nthe report by Mr Sz\u00e1jer, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council adapting a number of instruments subject to the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty to Council Decision 1999/468/EC, as amended by Decision 2006/512/EC, with regard to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny - Part Three - C6-0474/2007 - 2007/0282 (COD)).\nMargot Wallstr\u00f6m\nVice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the 'comitology dossier' has two main features. On the one hand, it is extremely technical, and probably any common citizen would find it difficult to understand. On the other hand, it is very important since it concerns how Parliament exercises its control over implementing acts. The 2006 reform of the Comitology Decision introduced something called the 'regulatory procedure with scrutiny', giving Parliament a veto right on measures of general scope that amend a legal act adopted under codecision.\nBy the end of 2006, 26 acts identified as particularly urgent were already brought into conformity with the new procedure, which ensures a stronger role for Parliament, and I am happy to see that today we are here to welcome further progress.\nBetween November 2007 and February 2008 the Commission proposed to", "24th Annual Report from the Commission on monitoring the application of Community law (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is a brief presentation of the report by Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the 24th Annual Report from the Commission on monitoring the application of Community law\nLidia Joanna Geringer de Oedenberg\nrapporteur. - (PL) Mr President, the effectiveness of European Union policies largely depends on their implementation at national, regional and local level. Member States' compliance with Community law must therefore be strictly monitored. As rapporteur for Parliament's 24th Annual Report on this subject, I can say that there has been a slight drop in the number of cases of infringement proceedings initiated by the Commission. Nonetheless, the number of cases continues to exceed 2,500.\nA 16% reduction of the number of proceedings relating to failures to comply with the obligation to inform the Commission about transposition proceedings in the enlarged Union of 25 Member States should also be mentioned. This indicates better discipline by Member States where notification is concerned. As in previous years, the vast majority of the charges concerned inappropriate operation of the single market, notably implementation of the principle of free movement of people, goods and services. Many charges also concerned violation of the rights derived from citizenship of the European Union, that guarantee the principle of equal rights and opportunities for all citizens. On 5 September 2007 the Commission proposed amending the working methods used to date. The proposal aimed to ensure more effective management of proceedings, and received the support of the majority of Members of this House. Concern has been expressed, however, that the new procedure may result in the Commission losing institutional responsibility as guardian of the Treaties, as it provides for referring charges received by the Commission back to t", "Establishment of residue limits of pharmacologically active substances in foodstuffs of animal origin (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the recommendation for second reading by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the Council common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down Community procedures for the establishment of residue limits of pharmacologically active substances in foodstuffs of animal origin, repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 and amending Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15079/2/2008 - C6-0005/0009 - (Rapporteur: Avril Doyle).\nAvril Doyle\nrapporteur. - Mr President, could I start by thanking all my shadow rapporteurs, and indeed the French Presidency for facilitating an early second-reading agreement?\nThis is a rather technical proposal as it aims to update the existing EU regime, the main purpose of which is to protect public health by limiting the exposure of consumers of food of animal origin to residues of pharmacologically active substances present in veterinary medicines and biocidal products. This is achieved by setting safety thresholds or maximum residue levels (MRLs) for approved substances and by banning substances which are either found to be unsafe or in respect of which a safety profile cannot be scientifically established.\nMRLs alone do not protect consumers. Consumers are directly protected by setting an appropriate withdrawal period before slaughter and by having controls in place to monitor it. In practice the withdrawal periods are set using a high safety factor which will reflect the amount of data available at the current stage of product development.\nWe have reached an agreement on the key issues. First of all, extrapolation of MRLs set for one species to another; secondly, adopting within the EU MRLs set internationally within ", "9.

EU approach towards Iran (\nBastiaan Belder\nMr President, at the initiative of the Group of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, and with the approval and consent of the other groups, I propose that the following oral amendment be inserted after paragraph 6:\n'Strongly condemns the illegal detention of Iranian opposition leaders, Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karoubi, together with their wives, by Iranian security forces and calls for their immediate and unconditional release; points out that the detention was carried out in violation of Iranian law; condemns the attitude of the Iranian authorities to the opposition exercising its legitimate right to protest and declares its solidarity with the Iranian people in their democratic aspirations; deplores the hypocrisy of the Iranian Government, which used excessive force, intimidation and arbitrary arrests against peaceful demonstrators demonstrating in solidarity with the Egyptian people on 14 February 2011, whilst claiming to support freedom in Egypt';\nAnna Ibrisagic\n(SV) The oral amendment concerns the deletion of a single word, and that is the word 'and'. I will read the text in English and then I will explain why:\n'whereas there has been a remarkable deepening of relations between Iran and Turkey;' the next word 'and' is deleted and the recital continues 'whereas Iran is using its state and non-state allies Syria, Hezbollah and Hamas, and also the Muslim Brotherhood, to destabilise the region'.\n(SV) We want to delete the word 'and' in the middle because we do not want to link relations between Turkey and Iran with Iran's relations with Hezbollah and Hamas.\n", "39. Production of fishmeal and fish oil (vote) \nReport: Struan Stevenson\n\n\u00c5sa Westlund\nMadam President, on a point of order, you are obviously having trouble seeing me at the moment. I asked twice for a check on my own report, which was refused. I just want to put it on record that perhaps this has happened because you cannot hear a woman sitting at the back, perhaps you will not give the floor or listen to that kind of request. You and your colleagues have been wrong several times, and although you listened to the request for a check, you did not in the case of my report, and I asked for twice. I think that should be put on record. Thank you.\n(Applause)\nPresident\nWe have heard what you say, but believe you me everybody here does their utmost to listen and to watch, but we take note of what you say.\n", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament, adjourned on Wednesday 12 September 2001.\n\nApproval of the Minutes of the previous sittings\nPresident\nThe Minutes of the sittings of Thursday 6 and Wednesday 12 September 2001 have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nSwoboda\nMadam President, although I know that we have more important things to do today, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that, on 6 September, I raised objections to the Minutes of the previous day and also asked - with a view to having these issues in general clarified, and not just this particular instance - that the committee responsible for dealing with agenda questions be asked to look into the matter of a vote result being retrospectively altered. Towards midday, I raised another objection and referred to my first one, but I have to date received no reply, and I do think that a Member is entitled to be given answers.\nSo I ask you firstly: do you think that a Member is entitled to be given answers when he raises objections? And secondly: when can I expect to receive one?\n\nPresident\nYes, Mr Swoboda, of course. I believe that Members are entitled to receive a reply to their comments and I can assure you that this matter will be sorted out.\n\nJarzembowski\nMadam President, of course Mr Swoboda is entitled to receive an accurate reply. I just want to ask your services to give it on the basis of the midday debate. Not to be too blunt about it, I had the feeling that Mr Swoboda, on the day itself, tried to use an amendment of the Minutes to change the outcome of this House's vote. For this reason, I ask that the midday debate should be taken as the basis of any answer your services give to Mr Swoboda, and please be so kind as to let me have a copy of it. I am quite sure that your services understood perfectly well what this House had in mind!\n\nPresident\nMr Jarzembowski, we shall look into the whole matter very carefully.\n(The Minutes were ap", "Implementation of REACH (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the oral question to the Commission on the pre-registration of phase-in substances according to the REACH Regulation - (B6-0490/2008).\nGuido Sacconi\nauthor. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will not take up a great deal of your time because this is a well-known topic. We are talking about the pre-registration of chemical substances, a preliminary stage, in fact the first stage in implementing REACH, which is very important. This is because it offers companies the opportunity to establish the right to apply a transitional regime, in other words, stagger the times specified for registering substances. This is a more demanding procedure which above all, even more importantly, can lead to the formation of groups of companies for sharing data. This means that data can be presented jointly by producers of the same substance.\nAs we are all well aware, we have received information to the effect that, compared to the initial forecasts which the REACH system was based on, the number of pre-registrations has not only been high, but actually far higher than predicted. We were talking in terms of a few hundred thousand, but the number of substances which have been pre-registered, and the Commissioner will certainly give us the exact figures for this, has probably passed the million mark. This presents a problem for us as it also raises a lot of questions about the causes of this explosion, or phenomenon you might say, which could even be positive. The main thing we know is that this avalanche of data, though still preliminary basic information, has severely tested the ability of the newly formed European Chemicals Agency in Helsinki to handle it.\nOur question then is exactly this: we want to know how these problems were tackled, what kind of structure has been set up if problems have been caused for the companies who have been very anxious, for want of a better term, about being able to meet the deadline", "Programme of activities of the Polish Presidency of the Council (debate) \nPresident\nThe first item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the programme of activities of the Polish Presidency of the Council.\nThus we begin the next Presidency of the European Union. For the European Parliament, the Presidency is even more important today than it was under the Treaty of Nice, because now we are responsible for enacting European legislation under the ordinary legislative procedure. This places additional responsibilities on us - on Parliament, and also on the Council - because all legislative measures for Europe now have to be negotiated. The Polish Presidency is also beginning at a difficult period for Europe - we are aware of this. So it is with great interest that we are going to listen to the programme proposed by the Polish Presidency, which will be presented by Prime Minister Donald Tusk.\nWelcome, Mr Tusk, to the Chamber.\n(Applause)\nDonald Tusk\nMr President, Mr Barroso, chairs of the political groups, friends, honourable Members from all the Member States of the European Union and of all political persuasions, I am aware that I am in a place which, for the European Union and all Europeans who treat the idea of Europe seriously, is something special. It is a place which guarantees that the memory of where Europe has come from will be kept alive in our minds. In particular - this is how I view the many years of the European Parliament's work - it is an institution and a place which has never stopped believing in the reason for having a united Europe. I say this not because it is the right thing to say, but primarily because my personal experience tells me that this is the case. The European Parliament has been extremely consistent in working for the unification of Europe, and is still working for this today. This unification does not just mean the accession of individual countries, but also has a more profound significance, thanks to which the citizen", "Approval of Minutes of previous sitting\nPresident\nYesterday's Minutes have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\nRichard Corbett\nMr President, Item 13 of the Minutes refers to a Member changing political group to join the ITS Group. It makes no reference to Mr Wise leaving the IND/DEM Group and I wondered whether this was a mistake. I understand his party, the UK Independence Party, has suspended him pending the investigations into alleged fraud in his case. Does this not mean that his group has also suspended him, or was the press campaign deliberately misleading?\nPresident\nI think your point is made, Mr Corbett. We will look into it.\n(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved)\n", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament, adjourned on Thursday 20 September 2001.\n\nStatement by the President\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, as you know, and as you can imagine, it is my sad duty to have to open this session of Parliament with the news of several disasters that have claimed the lives of many people. When I have finished reading the statement, I would like to suggest that we observe a minute' s silence to pay tribute to the victims.\nOn 21 September, Toulouse was struck by a disaster on an unprecedented scale, in which 29 people died and 2500 were injured. We have all been concerned and deeply saddened by the suffering of the victims' families, of the injured and by the grief of the people of Toulouse. Following the explosion at the AZF factory, I sent a message on behalf of Parliament, and on my own behalf, to the Mayor of Toulouse, Mr Douste-Blazy and to his fellow citizens, to express our solidarity and deepest sympathy. The exact causes of this awful disaster are still unknown, but one thing is certain: France, and all the countries of the European Union, must make a firm commitment to ensure that a tragedy like this never happens again. It will be held up as an example of what we must no longer tolerate, wherever similar risks exist. People' s safety must never be compromised due to negligence, passivity or an overriding concern to save money.\nIn a repeat of previous incidents, this time in Northern Ireland, a journalist, Martin O' Hagan, was murdered on European Union soil by terrorists with a single objective - to spread fear by firstly attacking those who work to inform others. This appalling act is an attack by its perpetrators on the fundamental values of the European Union, namely the right to life, the rule of law and the freedom of expression. Under no circumstances must these acts of terrorism call into question the efforts of all those who, in spite of the difficulties they encounter", "Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Carl Schlyter, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, Daniel Caspary, on behalf of the PPE Group, Kader Arif, on behalf of the S&D Group, Niccol\u00f2 Rinaldi, on behalf of the ALDE Group, Helmut Scholz, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, and Syed Kamall, on behalf of the ECR Group, on transparency and the state of play of the ACTA negotiations (Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement) - B7-0020/2010)\nCarl Schlyter\nMr President, each institution has to defend its role. Parliament is the voice of the people of the EU and must uphold the interests of its citizens. The Commission calls itself the guardian of the treaty, but in this case, it is the principles of transparency, human rights and parliamentary rights that you need to defend. If we are not given access to the documents, none of the EU institutions will be fulfilling its role or meeting our citizens' expectations.\nSome of the Commissioners emphasised in their hearings that Parliament must have access to documents on the same terms as the Council of Ministers, and Parliament expects the Commission to stand by its promises. Many of our citizens are concerned that they are being robbed of their freedoms and rights by the continual torrents of invasive legislation, such as the legislation on data retention, Ipred 1, Ipred 2, SWIFT, and so on. The EU cannot continue to negotiate on ACTA unless its citizens are given an opportunity to be involved in the process.\nThe main issue today is transparency, although naturally, the content is also sensitive. The EU must clearly indicate that the terms of our participation in the ACTA process are transparency and the defence of human rights and freedoms. Only once we have set out the inalienable rights that exist in a free and open society can we then, within the framework of these rights, fight crime and debate the form that various agreements are to take.\nIt ", "EC-Serbia Stabilisation and Association Agreement - Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EC and Serbia (continuation of debate) \nPresident\nThe next item on the agenda is the continuation of the joint debate on the EC-Serbia Agreement.\nMaria Eleni Koppa\nMadam President, I, too, should like to congratulate Mr Kacin on the balanced and detailed text which he has presented. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament wholeheartedly supports the accession prospects of Serbia, a country which has made tremendous progress over recent years and which forms the cornerstone for consolidating peace and stability in the Western Balkans. Parliament's approval today of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is therefore an historic moment and we welcome it. In the resolution by the European Parliament, we also welcome the accession request filed by this country, but emphasise that other steps still need to be taken.\nIt must be clear that the development of regional cooperation is still the Union's top priority in the Western Balkans. This being so, cooperation between Serbia and the International Criminal Court is an absolute international obligation and must proceed apace, not because Europe wants it, but because the dispensation of justice requires reconciliation with the past and allows relations to be improved between all the peoples of the former Yugoslavia.\nHowever, we must not forget that the Serbian people were victims of this war. Serbia is now the country with the highest number of refugees and internally displaced persons in Europe; people who need care and housing and to be integrated into the labour market. The Union must provide practical support for all efforts in this direction, especially in light of the credit crisis. We therefore welcome the recent commitment by the Presidents of Serbia and Croatia to find joint solutions to the refugee problem.\nThe decision to enter into dialogue with the aut", "2. (\n\nChristopher Beazley\nMr President, I rise under Rules 152 and 160 of the Rules of Procedure, concerning voting procedure and roll call votes. It is obvious that the Rules of Procedure have been abused and used in a way utterly contrary to their intention. Could I ask, through you, that specialists such as Mr Corbett and others look very carefully at what has happened today? My understanding is that the President has the discretion to rule that any request for a roll-call vote be declared invalid. That may become a necessity when we have heavier voting sessions in the future.\nReinhard Rack\n(DE) Mr President, in this House we have very liberal and, in particular, minority-friendly Rules of Procedure, and rightly so. It is our wish and our duty to preserve them. This, however, presupposes that the various groups exercise their minority rights properly and do not abuse them. When that happens - as it has done today - we should rethink this practice.\nDaniel Hannan\nMr President, I must take exception to the two points of order just made. The rules are absolutely clear on this. Every group has the right to request roll-call votes. No discretionary power is given to the Chair. We have always accepted that, ultimately, in any democratic chamber the majority has the right to get its way, but what we have just heard is the most intolerant position that does not allow any opposition, that does not allow any dissenting view and, if my colleagues want to understand why the European Union is so unpopular with the voters out there, you need only consider your own intolerant attitude towards anyone expressing any view other than your own.\n(Applause)\nPresident\nMr Hannan, to my knowledge, all votes which have taken place this morning have been by roll call. Therefore the Rules have been complied with meticulously.\nNigel Farage\nMr President, I wish to point out to Mr Beazley and Mr Rack, and perhaps to yourself, Mr President, that today is the first time since I have sat in the Eu", "Voting time\nPresident\nBefore starting the votes, Mr Schulz has asked to speak on a point of order.\nMartin Schulz\non behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I have asked to speak on behalf of my group for two reasons: firstly, for one very general reason - on account of yesterday's events here in this House - and secondly, because I have a request in connection with the forthcoming votes.\nI should like to deal with the general reason first, however. Mr President, would you please issue a statement about yesterday's events on behalf of my group, particularly about the very specific case, the case concerning our ushers here in this House. I wish to say: it is every man and every woman's absolute right to be able to express their opinion in this House. We are also accustomed to seeing posters and T-shirts and to everyone being free to express their opinion here. Anyone who is in favour of a referendum is entitled to express this in this House. What we experienced yesterday, however, is not acceptable in the context of this freedom of opinion.\n(Applause)\nWe can argue here about what individual fellow Members are doing here, how they conduct themselves, whether or not they shout. One thing is not acceptable, however, and that is that the ushers in this House, for whom - and I speak on behalf of all my fellow Members, of almost all Members, I believe, in this House - I have the greatest personal and professional respect...\n(Applause)\nWhat is not right - and I also speak specifically on behalf of my fellow Member Mr Daul and, I think, also, on behalf of Mr Watson, Mr Cohn-Bendit and Mr Wurtz - is that ushers in this House are physically and verbally assaulted in a heated debate: ushers, who have been discharging the duties of their office, and were described yesterday as the Gestapo and SS. This is a disgrace, Mr President! I think the House should express its total solidarity with the ushers.\n(Sustained applause)\nLadies and gentlemen, the ushers in this House are not", "The ratification and implementation of the updated ILO conventions (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the oral question to the Commission on the ratification and implementation of the updated ILO conventions by Alejandro Cercas, on behalf of the S&D Group, Marian Harkin, on behalf of the ALDE Group, Jean Lambert, on behalf of the VERTS/ALE Group, and Gabriele Zimmer and Ilda Figueiredo, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group - B7-0228/2009).\nAlejandro Cercas\nMadam President, fellow Members, Members of the Commission, we all know that economic globalisation, the international financial crisis and all future challenges must be addressed at the global level. We can no longer tackle these problems at the national or even regional levels. Cooperation between the European Union and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) has therefore become a key item on our agenda.\nThe ILO, with its tripartite method, is doing invaluable work in bringing coherence and rationality to our world. Our values are those on which the ILO was founded. It and we are working towards a social model that respects people's dignity, and we believe that we can work together. It is clear that Europe needs the ILO in order to maintain that social model - we could not do so in an unjust world - and that the ILO gives us the opportunity to be a global player in international relations.\nThe European Union and its Member States claim that they are working very closely with the ILO and that they are promoting the programme on decent work for all and the Global Jobs Pact, with the ILO at the helm. However, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, there is a lack of consistency between what we all say and what we do. It is therefore absolutely crucial this evening to discuss ratification of the ILO conventions, and tomorrow to approve a resolution on the issue, in order to offer certain guarantees to the ILO and also to our own project.\nIn your Communication on a Renewed Social Agenda, you called upon Member Stat", "7. Standards of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation (\nBefore the vote:\nMiroslav Mikol\u00e1\u0161ik\nToday is a great day for European citizens and for European patients. Through the adoption of this directive on human organ donation and transplantation, we are enabling treatment and a high quality of life at home and at work for thousands of people who are desperately waiting for a transplant.\nI would like to thank all of the political groups who are intending to support my directive.\nLadies and gentlemen, this is not about politics, it is about people's health.\nThank you very much indeed.\n", "2. Situation of Burmese refugees in Thailand\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the situation of Burmese refugees in Thailand.\nErik Meijer\nauthor. - (NL) Madam President, Burma is known as a violent military dictatorship in which a caste of profiteers has been able to hang onto power for many years. Oppression and poverty have caused many people to flee the country, or to try to do so.\nThe country's ethnic diversity both justifies and reinforces this dictatorship. In large areas, minority peoples are in the majority. They pursue autonomy and organise protests against the central dictatorship. The military leaders consider their dictatorship necessary to be able to keep the country together permanently and to subjugate the rebellious people. They are more interested in the territory than in the people who live in it. By issuing major exploitation concessions to foreign businesses, vital sources of income are taken from the indigenous people, with nature and the environment being seriously damaged in the process.\nThe need to flee the country is further reinforced by the fact that no consideration is given to the regional majority peoples. The regime is keen to eliminate troublesome groups, either by killing them or by chasing them out of the country. Many flee into the sea in makeshift dinghies, running the considerable risk of drowning. Burma's neighbour, Thailand, has seen many refugees cross the border: according to some estimates, as many as two million people have fled over the past 25 years, and tens of thousands who have been refused entry remain homeless in the no man's land along the border.\nUnfortunately, feelings of sympathy or solidarity with refugees are even less well developed in South East Asia than they are in Europe. Very often, refugees are sent home, even if this means certain death. Public opinion shows little interest, even if it involves people who share their religion, such as the Muslim boat refugees who en", "Agenda\nMartin Schulz\n(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to raise two points of order and I would like to be able to raise them one after another. Firstly, I have a request for the entire House. It refers to an urgent matter which we will be discussing this afternoon. This is the case of Aminatou Haidar.\nWe have an urgent matter on the agenda this afternoon. I would ask my fellow Members to put their trust in me with regard to the following process. Some Members who have been closely involved with this case know - and I cannot give any more details at this point, but I am one of those who knows - that we will have a solution for this case during the course of the day. Prominent government representatives from the EU are working to achieve a positive solution. Therefore, it would be sensible to remove this urgent matter from the agenda this afternoon, because any further debate would only hinder the work which is being done through diplomatic channels. This is why I am asking the House to agree that in this exceptional case, we should remove this urgent matter from the agenda, because this will be of greater help in resolving the case than debating it would be. That was my first request, Mr President. The second request will follow immediately.\nPresident\nMr Schulz, I am not certain we can discuss this point again. I am afraid it is already too late, because we made a decision on this matter earlier. It is difficult, now, to discuss this point again.\nJoseph Daul\n(FR) Mr President, I support Mr Schulz's proposal. I believe that the negotiations are extremely difficult. We are talking about a case that concerns a human being, a woman, and efforts are under way to find a political solution.\nI therefore believe that, when efforts are under way to find a political solution, it is important not to exacerbate the situation. I ask that we first be allowed to find a political solution.\n(Applause)\nMiguel Portas\n(PT) I would just like to make a brief point. The", "EU consumer policy strategy 2007-2013 (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Lasse Lehtinen, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the EU Consumer Policy strategy 2007-2013.\nLasse Lehtinen\nrapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, the report before us has undergone a thorough reading in committee, for which I thank my colleagues and above all the shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups. In a spirit of consensus we have noted the Commission's laudable efforts to highlight consumer issues in all areas of policy.\nThis continent will not be able to compete in global markets unless it can compete in its own internal market. The 27 national mini-markets must be combined to constitute the largest retail market in the world.\nA viable internal market requires action to boost consumer confidence. Strong and independent consumer organisations have an important role in this.\nAmong the options for increasing confidence there is one which has stood out more than others in our discussions and which also caused the only disagreements worth mentioning. It is about the possibility of consumers having the tools to pursue compensation if something goes wrong. The view is expressed in this report that it is indispensable for consumers to have a cross-border collective redress system in cases where there is a dispute.\nCommissioner Kuneva has already promised to start considering what sort of system of collective redress might work in Europe. At least there seems to be broad consensus among us in Europe on what sort of system it should not be. It should not have any fundamental similarity with the American collective redress system, which mainly benefits lawyers, not consumers. In Europe we have to aim for a system where claims for compensation are directly linked to actual damage caused. This way, how justice is dispensed would not so much focus on the penalty but on obtaining justice for the consumer. Collective redress systems would", "Announcement by the President\nPresident\nI would like to inform the House that I have received a letter from the President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, in which he informs me of the European Council's decision to consult the European Parliament on the proposal by the Spanish Government concerning the composition of the European Parliament and to seek Parliament's consent not to convene a Convention on this matter. It concerns the 18 additional Members of the European Parliament. I have handed the proposal to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which has just begun work on this matter and will shortly appoint a rapporteur. Work on this will continue.\nI would also like to tell you that, following the Bulgarian Government's decision to withdraw its candidate for Commissioner-designate, it has put forward a new candidate. The Conference of Presidents will decide tomorrow on the final timetable, but the most likely date for the hearing of the new Commissioner-designate is 3 February, with the vote on 9 February. This, of course, also depends on a decision from Mr Barroso and on his talks with the Bulgarian Government's newly appointed candidate. Nothing has yet been established, but I wanted the House to have this general information about what our next steps will be. At all events, the European Parliament is in full control of the situation. There are no exceptional situations here, and we are acting in accordance with democratic procedures. These procedures are of fundamental significance to us and this is how the European Parliament will always work under my Presidency.\nI would also like to tell you about how the European Parliament envisages working with the two-and-a-half-year permanent Presidency of the European Union and the European Council and how it will work with the rotating Presidency. The rotating Presidency, in this case the Spanish Presidency, will always present its six-month plan of action at the beginning of the six-month period and ", "Welfare of laying hens (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Paolo De Castro, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the welfare of laying hens - B7-0657/2010).\nPaolo De Castro\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today represents an important opportunity to discuss the strategic issue of protecting animal welfare in agriculture. On 1 January 2012, the terms of Council Directive 1999/74/EC will enter into force, laying down minimum standards for the protection of hens, tantamount to the abolition of conventional battery cages as a system of rearing for the production of eggs. This method of animal housing will be banned in favour of systems of rearing that guarantee better animal welfare.\nMr President, the memory of the Council of the European Union on Agriculture, held on 19 July 1999, is fresh in my mind. It was an important day, on which, as the representative of my country (at the time I was the Italian Minister for Agriculture), I contributed to the approval of this important directive by voting for it.\nNow, one year after the irrevocable entry into force of the new legislation, data show that European producers are proceeding to adapt their production system, but not without running into difficulties. What we need is a concrete commitment from the Commission to safeguard animal welfare, to protect producers who have adapted their system of rearing to Council Directive 1999/74/EC, and, at the same time, to effectively guarantee the passage of the new legislation, avoiding distortions in terms of market competition.\nThis is why my fellow Members and I felt it appropriate to add this important topic to the agenda of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour of chairing. Hard work over recent months, involving all parliamentary groups, resulted in the oral question of 28 October 2010, which puts three important issues to the Commission:\nF", "EU cohesion and regional policy after 2013 - Future of the European Social Fund (debate) \nPresident\nWe apologise for the slight delay caused by the traffic. I would recommend that everyone walk to Parliament for three reasons. The first reason is to arrive on time. The second is because it is healthy. The third is that it causes less pollution. So, let us all walk to Parliament!\nThe next item is the joint debate on the oral question to the Commission, by Danuta Maria H\u00fcbner, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on EU cohesion and regional policy after 2013 - B7-0466/2010);\nand the Commission statement on the future of the European Social Fund.\nDanuta Maria H\u00fcbner\nauthor. - Mr President, in the years to come, growth in Europe will be supply-driven. Sustainable and competitive investment patterns will be crucial. Cohesion policy is a major source of European public investment and must work as a catalyst for structural change by investing in research and innovation, resource efficiency, new and sustainable jobs and infrastructure.\nIt must not merely be a financial tool for investment. It is a policy that generates new resources, adding to growth potential. It will require an adequate macro-economic and financial framework to achieve its full impact. The key issue for post-2013 reform of cohesion policy is how to make it more effective in generating growth, jobs and competitiveness for the European economy in a sustainable way.\nSocial, economic and territorial cohesion is, according to the treaty, a basic principle of European integration. It must therefore be a policy applicable to all Europe's citizens, and not one restricted to the poorest regions. This is because it is not a subsidy policy based on the principle of compensation for the past, working as a supplement to national objectives, but rather a European policy for the future.\nIt must take into account the post-crisis territorial reality at regional level, looking for the most effective solution", "14.

Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me pleasure to be able to report to you on the European Council that was held on 4 and 5 November, and which was a productive meeting.\nCentral to that meeting were areas that are of major importance to the public, such as the economy, and the area of freedom, security and justice.\nWe also discussed the issue of \u2018Communicating Europe\u2019,namely improving communication and interaction between politicians and citizens across Europe. Finally, we debated a number of topical external issues, including Iraq.\nRecent developments in my own country give me no choice but to start with the topic of freedom, security and justice. Those developments illustrate in an unpleasant but powerful manner that a further step in cooperation in those areas is indispensable.\nI am very indebted to you, Mr President, for the words of support and solidarity which you spoke to the Dutch Government and the entire Dutch community on 15 November. Allow me to react to those words in my national capacity.\nThe Netherlands is proud of its diversity. Since the Second World War, we have received large groups of people from many countries \u2013 some because they were persecuted, others because they could build a better future with us and were welcome reinforcements on our labour market. The contribution of those people in terms of quality of our society is immense and is appreciated.\nToday, they, and their relatives, belong among us, and that \u2018belonging\u2019 requires consideration and effort from both parties. Integration is a complex issue that touches on identity, standards and values, as well as getting to know and understand each other. At the same time, integration also requires respect and compliance with the fundamental rules of our society: freedom of opin", "2. Human rights in Syria (vote) \nMotion for a resolution\n- Before the vote\nBernd Posselt\n(DE) Mr President, we should have liked to insert:\n'Calls for the abrogation of the state of emergency in Syria established more than 40 years ago'.\n(DE) as paragraph 6(a).\nPresident\nAre there any objections to the inclusion of this oral amendment?\nV\u00e9ronique De Keyser\n(FR) Mr President, please note that I find the number of MEPs present needed to oppose the oral amendment utterly preposterous this Thursday afternoon. Indeed, more people than the total number here in the Chamber are needed to vote against. I am not sure there are even 40 people here in favour of this oral amendment. I cannot oppose the oral amendment itself, but I am firmly opposed to the procedure. I should like you to take note of this.\nPresident\nLet me remind you of the rule. The number of people required to oppose the adoption of an oral amendment is always the same regardless of when we vote and of the time, the day and the place of the vote. To propose an amendment, however, requires just one single MEP.\nYou can call for a quorum, but there is a procedure, a different procedure, for that. Yet if you ask to verify the quorum and the quorum has not been reached, I should like to remind you that this vote will not be adjourned because it is an emergency vote. The text will lapse, and there will not be a vote on it. That is the rule.\nMarios Matsakis\nMr President, it is not the Rules of Procedure that are wrong but the fact that colleagues from our groups leave early. They should be here to vote!\n(Applause)\n(The oral amendment was accepted)\n", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of the last sitting have been distributed. Are there any comments?\n\nCorbett\nMadam President, I would just like to say I was present although I am not included in the list at the back.\n\nOomen-Ruijten\nMadam President, this also applies to me. I am not on the list either. But there is I something else I would like to say, Madam President. Yesterday the debate on the various oral questions was chaotic. We had a number of debates: Nigeria, Burma, the United Nations. These debates, and the speakers, were taken randomly. This throws Parliament into chaos, and is not very courteous towards the Commission representatives or the Presidency, who have difficulty making sense of anything from the different remarks which are made at cross-purposes.\nMadam President, I would therefore ask you whether in future, when as a group we submit to you the list of speakers per subject, you could keep to it.\n\nPresident\nMrs Oomen-Ruijten, I have taken note of your criticism. We shall discuss it amongst the few people who are leading the session here, and then it will certainly be possible next time to proceed in a more orderly fashion.\n\nEwing\nMadam President, the Minutes of Wednesday Part I, page 1, sub-paragraph, ' the following spoke on the new rules' . That is in the official record. I have been arguing that it was a new rule but have been assured by the Chair that it is not a new rule. It is something other than a new rule. I note the last sentence of the next paragraph which states 'The President replied that the new rules were being applied for the first time' . If there is a procedure for new rules, this House has to agree to them. One gets a little tired of raising points of order on something so clear but it nevertheless is in the Minutes and it is incorrect.\n\nPresident\nMrs Ewing, in logical terms you are, of course, right. If it were a matter of changing the agenda that would have to be decided by the plenary. But it is not. It is a new ", "Question Time (Commission) \nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B7-0017/2010). This will be a little shorter this evening than it should be because the preceding debate overran by 25 minutes because of earlier delays. I am sorry about that. We will finish some time after 19.30. I intend to be very crisp on time. Speakers from the floor have 30 seconds.\nThe following questions are addressed to the Commission.\nPart one\n\nSubject: Regulation of private pension funds\nIn recent years, the value of private pension fund assets has decreased a great deal. The need for closer regulation of the private pension fund sector has been underlined by the high level group on financial supervision chaired by Jacques de Larosi\u00e8re.\nThe financial crisis has highlighted the extent to which Member States are vulnerable to a wide range of risks. These risks are of direct concern to investors in those funds and to the stability and integrity of European financial markets, as well as seriously affecting financial market participants. In this unstable period for the economy, many European citizens have lost confidence in the regulation of the private pension fund system.\nDoes the Commission not take the view that it should propose a comprehensive legal measure to lay down monitoring standards with the purpose of regulating private pension funds?\nMichel Barnier\nMrs Blinkevi\u010di\u016bthas asked a very important question about pension reform, which is a key issue for the coming years, given the challenges that we have to face together: demographic ageing, the viability of public finances and the mobility of employees in particular. Moreover, pension funds are major institutional investors.\nThe financial crisis has shown up the weaknesses in the design of some pensions schemes and, ladies and gentlemen, following on from the de Larosi\u00e8re report, we are going to take some initiatives. President Barroso has announced some policy guidelines on this matter to the European Parliament.\nDuring 2010, we ar", "Prevention and settlement of conflicts of jurisdiction in criminal proceedings (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Renate Weber, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the Czech Republic, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia, the Slovak Republic and of the Kingdom of Sweden for adoption of a Council framework decision 2009/.../JHA on prevention and settlement of conflicts of exercise of jurisdiction in criminal proceedings (08535/2009 - C7-0205/2009 -.\nAntonio Tajani\nVice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, as this is the first time that I have spoken before this new Parliament, I would like to congratulate you on being elected to the Vice-Presidency.\nAs far as the Weber report is concerned, I speak on behalf of Vice-President Barrot and I would like first of all to thank the rapporteur and the members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for the excellent quality of their work. The Commission welcomes the report and supports some of the proposed amendments. The Commission is, by and large, in favour of the proposal presented by five Member States, although the text is not as ambitious as it would have wished. More specifically, the Commission deplores the fact that the scope of the framework decision has been limited to cases where the same person is subject to parallel criminal proceedings for the same offence. The Commission also regrets the fact that the obligation to refer to Eurojust cases where there is a conflict of jurisdiction has been limited and that the list of criteria which must be taken into account to determine the most appropriate jurisdiction has been removed from the operative part of the text. These amendments have weakened the text of the proposal, taking away most of its added value.\nFrom the Commission's point of view, the proposal should be considered only as a first step towards the prevention and settlement of conflic", "Conclusions of the European Council meeting (28-29 October) and economic governance (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the key debate on the conclusions of the European Council meeting (28-29 October) and economic governance.\nI would like to welcome to the Chamber the President of the Council, Mr Van Rompuy, and the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso. Also present with us are representatives of the Belgian Presidency and the Commission. We will begin with the information which will be given to us by the President of the Council, Mr Van Rompuy.\nHerman Van Rompuy\nPresident of the European Council. - Mr President, the European Council meeting of 28/29 October focused on the economic governance of our Union, in particular with the report of the Task force on economic governance. The report which it endorsed and the events since then, and I refer in particular to Ireland, have illustrated the importance of the subject in general and of the need for the rapidly deployable financial mechanism we decided on in May, in particular.\nI pay tribute to the speed of the action of the Finance Ministers over the last week and I underline that this illustrates the level of determination of our concern to safeguard the stability of the euro.\n'EU and euro-area financial support will be provided under a strong policy programme which will be negotiated with the Irish authorities by the Commission and the IMF, in liaison with the European Central Bank. [...] Given the strong fundamentals of the Irish economy, decisive implementation of the programme should allow a return to a robust and sustainable growth, safeguarding the economic and social cohesion.' I am here quoting the Eurogroup and ECOFIN Ministers.\nThe task force was not an intergovernmental conference, but it was a review of our working methods, priorities and procedures in this field. We sought to get the right balance between, on the one hand, laying down an overall European framework regarding the need to avoid excessiv", "Electric cars (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on electric cars.\nDiego L\u00f3pez Garrido\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Tajani, as you know, European industry as a whole has been seriously affected by the global economic and financial crisis, and in this extremely tough climate for all sectors of the economy and also for industry, we believe that Europe's utmost priority is to restore growth and employment.\nToday we have heard good news in the Commission's forecasts regarding the recovery that is taking place in the whole of the European Union. Although the recovery is small, ultimately it is recovery, and in particular it must mean industrial activity.\nWe believe that industry - and on this I am certain that I am in agreement with the Vice-President of the Commission, because we recently spoke about this matter and he agrees with us - is and must be an irreplaceable driving force behind growth and recovery for the European economy. We therefore need to back European industry.\nEuropean industry - I repeat - can play a driving role in the economy and in order for this to be the case we firstly need to protect our industrial fabric from the tough economic climate that we are experiencing, and secondly we need to improve the competitiveness of European industry. In other words, European industry needs to return to leadership and competitiveness in the global market; it needs to back innovation and the development of new technologies. In this respect, as in many other things, it is very important for the response to these challenges to have a European perspective and a European focus.\nWithin the industrial sector we need to place special emphasis on the sectors with the greatest capacity for impact and growth. One of those is undoubtedly the vehicle sector, with its great capacity for transferring technology to other activities, its impact on employment, its export capacity and", "The performance and sustainability of the European aviation system - Aerodromes, air traffic management and air navigation services (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on\nthe report by Marian-Jean Marinescu, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulations (EC) No 549/2004, (EC) No 550/2004, (EC) No 551/2004 and (EC) No 552/2004 in order to improve the performance and sustainability of the European aviation system - C6-0250/2008 -, and\nthe report by Marian-Jean Marinescu, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 in the field of aerodromes, air traffic management and air navigation services and repealing Council Directive 2006/23/EEC - C6-0251/2008 -.\nMarian-Jean Marinescu\nrapporteur. - (RO) The Single European Sky II package is designed for the entire air transport system, with direct, positive ramifications for airlines, air navigation service providers, traffic controllers, airports and the aeronautical industry. It is actually the legislator's response to the need to harmonise and make European airspace and air traffic more efficient for the benefit of the environment, industry and, first and foremost, passengers.\nThe agreement reached with the Council on the SES II package is a step forward for us on the road to consolidating the European Union. This is the next natural step after a common market, adopting a single currency and creating the Schengen area. From 2012 we will have a Schengen airspace. Routes will be shorter, traffic control more efficient and air navigation services will be optimised and, in the future, integrated.\nAs a result, flights will be shorter, less fuel will be used and carbon dioxide emissions will be lower, which should normally lead to a reduction in airline ticket prices.\nThe compromise rea", "3. (\n- Before the vote:\nJan Andersson\nrapporteur. - (SV) Thank you, Mr President. With reference to the letter which the European trade union organisation sent to all its members last week, I should like to say that I can understand the views of the trade union movement regarding the question whether any consultation took place between the social partners and the Commission. However, it is beyond our capabilities to do anything about that.\nThe content of this Directive will not change in any way. What will happen is that its implementation will be postponed for four years. The reason is that it may not be possible to use some incredibly important medical equipment if implementation takes place in April. Studies are currently in progress to determine how this equipment can be made compatible with the Directive.\nWe therefore gave our backing to the postponement of the Directive with the full agreement of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.\nG\u00fcnter Verheugen\nVice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, on behalf of the Commission, I would like to give the following explanation. In proposing postponement of entry into force of this directive, the Commission was reacting responsibly to new scientific evidence - I repeat, new scientific evidence - namely a study commissioned by the Government of the United Kingdom and published in June 2007. This new scientific evidence showed that the potential entry into force of the directive in its present form in April 2008 would have a major unintended detrimental effect on the practice of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the best performing and safest imaging technology in contemporary medicine. I would like to add, because I am responsible for that sector, that, without this technology, thousands of patients in the European Union would not get the best possible treatment. I would also like to add that our producers are world leaders in this sector.\nMr Andersson mentioned the question of consultation. I would like ", "Statement by the President\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, we are all aware of the dreadful tropical cyclone, Nargis, which ravaged Burma/Myanmar last Saturday. It was a tragedy in which tens of thousands of people lost their lives, hundreds of thousands lost their homes, and the infrastructure in the most densely populated areas of the country was destroyed. This is the greatest disaster the country has ever experienced, and the full extent of the loss of human life and damage is not yet known.\nThe military junta that rules the country has apparently not managed to deal with the situation properly. No preventive measures were taken, nor was the population given adequate support.\nAlthough it is welcome news that the constitutional referendum has been postponed until 24 May in the regions worst affected by the cyclone (the Rangoon and Irrawaddy Delta regions), this postponement must be extended throughout the country if the government's concern for its own people is to be expressed by focusing on urgent humanitarian support and immediate action.\nThe authorities have indicated that they would welcome international support. This should be seen as a positive gesture, and we expect the government to facilitate the implementation of international assistance measures.\nThe European Union has already begun initiating emergency assistance measures. During our next plenary session in Strasbourg we will hear the European Commission' report on the humanitarian aid provided and the conditions for the provision of aid there.\nThe people of Burma/Myanmar deserve our heartfelt solidarity. Therefore, I would like to express this on behalf of the European Parliament, and in all sincerity, and I would add that at this time we are also thinking of our Sakharov Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi. We stand with her in a bond of solidarity and demand that she be released so that she can work for the freedom of her people and for democracy in their country.\n", "Amendment of Directive 2004/49/EC on safety on the Community's railways - Interoperability of the Community rail system (recast) - Amendment of Regulation (EC) No 881/2004 establishing a European Railway Agency (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following reports:\nby Mr Costa, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2004/49/EC on the safety on the Community's railways - 6-0493/2006 -;\nby Mr Ortuondo Larrea, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the interoperability of the Community rail system (recast) - C6-0474/2006 -;\nby Mr Costa, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 881/2004 establishing a European Railway Agency - C6-0473/2006 -.\nJacques Barrot\nMember of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after the adoption of the first two railway packages in 2001 and 2004 and before the adoption of the third railway package on 13 December 2006, the Commission proposed a new set of legislative measures on cross-acceptance of rolling stock, particularly locomotives. The aim of the measures is to revamp the rail sector by removing hindrances to the operation of trains on the European rail network.\nThe Commission launched this initiative for two main reasons: to facilitate free movement of trains within the EU by making the procedure for placing locomotives in service more transparent and efficient, and also to simplify regulations by consolidating and merging the three rail interoperability directives into a single directive.\nThe full package contains a communication, three legislative proposals and their impact assessment: a communication setting out the current difficulties and proposing a number of soluti", "5. Agreement between the EC and Pakistan on readmission (\nCsaba S\u00f3gor\nMr President, allow me to express my thanks for the statement by the European Commission which will be attached to the Agreement between the European Union and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, to be voted upon presently, concerning the proposal for a Council decision on the readmission of persons residing without authorisation.\n", "Sakharov Prize 2009 (announcement of the winner)\nPresident\nI would like to start with some important information about the Sakharov Prize for 2009. This morning's Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize for 2009 to Memorial, the organisation of Oleg Orlov, Sergey Kovalev and Lyudmila Alexeyeva and all other defenders of human rights in Russia whom it represents. We have awarded this year's prize to Memorial. We sincerely hope that by doing so, we will contribute to ending the circle of fear, uncertainty and violence surrounding human rights defenders in the Russian Federation.\nWe also hope to advance our message that civil society activists everywhere must be free to exercise their most basic rights of freedom of thought and freedom of speech and freedom of the written word. We need to be free to follow our thoughts because this is essential in getting at the truth.\nLet me share with you my great satisfaction in being able to announce this prize as the President of the European Parliament and, in particular, as a man who comes from Solidarity. At one time, we had serious problems very similar to those that our colleagues and partners in the Russian Federation have today. I am very pleased that truth and freedom will always win in the end. This is how it was in many countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The fact that the Russians who are seeking the truth today are unable to go about their business freely is a major problem for the whole of Europe as well as a personal tragedy for themselves. The purpose of this prize is for us Members of the European Parliament to express our great support for their activities.\n(Applause)\nI would like to make a couple of general points: since 1988, which is over 20 years ago now, the European Parliament inaugurated the annual Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought to honour persons or organisations for their contribution to the development of human rights and fundamental values.\nWe should als", "Situation in Syria, Bahrain and Yemen\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Mrs Ashton, on the situation in Syria, Bahrain and Yemen.\nThe President-in-Office of the Council, Mr N\u00e9meth, will speak on behalf of Mrs Ashton.\nZsolt N\u00e9meth\non behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, I am here today to present to you some remarks on behalf of the High Representative, Catherine Ashton, on the situation in Bahrain, Syria and Yemen.\nEvents have recently taken a dramatic turn in Syria. In Yemen, an already dire situation may well get worse and the very tense atmosphere which now prevails in Bahrain is of serious concern, even if the bloodshed there has been less. The EU has been following the rapidly unfolding events in the entire region very attentively, as confirmed by numerous high-level meetings, formal statements and Council conclusions.\nMore than this, Baroness Ashton has been maintaining constant contact with key partners, as well as with key players in the countries themselves. This is being done every day directly by phone or through her representatives in the countries in question, in order to bring the EU's influence to bear wherever this is possible and whenever it can help. Every country's situation is unique and demands a strategic, carefully thought-out, well-tailored reaction. But when events move so fast, it is all the more crucial to build sound policy on solid fundamental principles.\nLet me cite three principles: first, the rejection of violence - mass protests must always be dealt with peacefully and with full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; secondly, the promotion of dialogue - differences and grievances must be addressed in a constructive manner by the right people being ready to talk to each other, setting as", "Opening of the sitting\n(The sitting was opened at 10 a.m.)\nRichard Corbett\nMadam President, on a point of order, under our Rules of Procedure, Annex I, Article 2, any Member who has not submitted a declaration of interests has to be reminded of this fact by the President. If he or she continues to fail to do so, this fact is published in the Minutes. It is then stated that, if the Member continues to refuse to submit the declaration, the President shall take action in accordance with Rule 147 to suspend the Member concerned.\nI see from the Minutes of the sitting on Monday that Mr Herrero-Tejedor and Mr Nattrass, from the UK Independence Party, have still failed to complete their declaration of interests. It is now several months in a row that they have been named and shamed in the Minutes and I would urge the President to take action appropriate to the situation. It undermines the reputation and the credibility of this House.\nPresident\nI shall pass that on, Mr Corbett.\n", "2. Russia\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on five motions for a resolution on the arrest of demonstrators following the presidential election in Russia.\nBernd Posselt\nauthor. - (DE) Mr President, in the run-up to drafting this resolution, some of us were accused of being enemies or opponents of Russia. We are just the opposite! We are friends of Russia, we are concerned about democracy and the rule of law in this important European country. We protest vehemently against the imprisonment of opposition activists who did no more than draw attention to a fact that has been noted by all international institutions, namely that the presidential elections in Russia were extremely unfair.\nWe call for the immediate release of the opposition activists and of others who have been held in prisons and work camps for a long time, like the so-called Yukos prisoners Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, and I support Chancellor Merkel's call for the two men finally to be released.\nWe must, however, be quite clear about one thing. The newly elected President of Russia has the unique opportunity to make a new beginning, to move towards democracy and the rule of law and towards a less nationalistic and aggressive foreign policy. That means, however, that he will have to extricate himself from the coils of Gazprom and free himself from the Putin system; sadly, there is not the least indication of that.\nThat is why it is our duty to voice honest criticisms. It is not those who, like former German Chancellor Schr\u00f6der, sing the praises of the Putin system and allow themselves to become involved in the propaganda and in the economic and nationalistic interests of that system, who are Russia's friends; no, Russia's friends support the human and civil rights of the Russian people, who have a chance of democratic development.\nIf we remain silent, the small seeds of democracy and the rule of law that President Yeltsin sowed and that President Putin has endangered will finally be suffocated, and that ", "3. Common rules in the field of civil aviation security (vote) \n- Costa recommendation\n- Before the vote\nRobert Goebbels\n(FR) Mr President, yesterday, during the debate, Mr Barrot announced that he was in possession of a written version of the Commission position on the amendments tabled by Members, and I note that this document has not been distributed. I call on you to ensure that the Commission positions are made available to Members, since many Members are waiting to learn what these positions are.\nPresident\nVery well, Mr Goebbels, we shall ensure that that happens.\n", "Agricultural product quality policy: what strategy to follow? (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Scott\u00e0, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on Agricultural product quality policy: what strategy to follow?\nGiancarlo Scott\u00e0\nMadam President, ladies and gentlemen, with market globalisation and the severe crisis now affecting Europe, including in the agricultural sector, one possible response on the part of the agricultural market is to place emphasis on product quality.\nI believe that a good EU quality policy can enhance competitiveness and create added value for Europe's regional economies, since, for many rural areas where production alternatives are few, it is often the one and only opportunity for development. By supporting niche agriculture in these disadvantaged areas, we will create an economy and jobs there.\nFurthermore, a future quality policy must also be linked to the major potentialities of agriculture which, as in the European case, is modern, dynamic, rich and diversified and can offer not only high quality food products but also services of great value to a constantly evolving society.\nIn my report, I emphasised the importance of keeping the three systems for registration of geographical indications separate, since they represent the link with European regions, representing their traditions, history, taste and unique knowledge handed down over time.\nI therefore believe that, by keeping the two PDO and PGI systems separate, they take account of the specific differences in the nature and strength of the links between the products and their geographical area of production. Consumers often confuse the geographical indication of where a food product was processed with the place of origin of the agricultural product as such, and are often not aware of how the food chain operates.\nI therefore consider that only the compulsory indication of the place of production of the primary products can provide consumers with ", "Statements by the President\nPresident\nTo begin, I would like to give you three items of information.\nI would like to inform you that the written statement 89/2010 has achieved the required number of signatures. As a result, I would like to announce that it has now been accepted by the European Parliament. The statement concerns the unilateral reintroduction of visas for Czech citizens by Canada. The European Parliament expects the Commission and Council to take immediate measures with respect to Canada's decision to withdraw visas for citizens of the Czech Republic. We also expect greater resolve from the Council and the Commission in their actions. We feel complete solidarity with the citizens of the Czech Republic who, as members of the European Union, should be able to travel to Canada without visas.\nItem number 2: For the seventh time, on 11 March, which is in four days' time on Friday, we will be celebrating the European Day for Victims of Terrorism. On this day in 2004, bomb attacks in Madrid killed nearly 200 people. 16 months later, 52 people were killed during attacks in London. Terrorism is an attack against the very foundations of democracy. There is no excuse for terrorism, and no attack or terrorist will ever be able to weaken the spirit of European solidarity or the spirit of European democracy.\nItem number 3: We were very concerned to receive information regarding the execution in Taiwan on Friday of five people. The reinstatement of the death penalty in 2010 was a de facto reversal of the moratorium in force since 2006. The European Union and the European Parliament in particular have long condemned the enforcement of the death penalty all over the world. I call on the Taiwanese authorities to impose a moratorium on carrying out this inhumane punishment and, in the future, to remove it from its criminal code.\n", "Question Time (Commission) \nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B7-0019/2011).\nBefore I start Question Time, because we are so late, I want to say a couple of things about the manner in which I will be conducting Question Time. I would be grateful if everybody would pay attention, including, if I may ask politely, the Commissioners who will be responding. I will take, by way of supplementary questions, only the author of the question because we do not have enough time to do more if we are to get through enough questions. I would ask the Commissioners who are responding or delivering their first answer not, please, to read us a long essay. We would like a very nice answer and an informative answer to our question, so that you can have some dialogue with the questioner.\nThe following questions are addressed to the Commission.\nJ\u00f6rg Leichtfried\n(DE) Madam President, I must admit that I support your arguments about the time available. However, I would like to ask you to take one thing into account. The Members who want to ask questions are not the ones who are responsible for the fact that we are running so late. My problem is that I put a question to the Council concerning a matter which will now be dealt with as Question No 2. My question to the Council was identical to this, but Question Time with the Council has now been cancelled, without a replacement. This is, of course, rather unfortunate, and I would like to ask you to review your otherwise completely logical and understandable approach with regard to this one question.\nPresident\nI have no alternative in the circumstances we find ourselves in tonight. I am very sorry for all the questioners, but the best I can do is to get through as many questions as possible and let questioners have their moment. It is not a position I relish, and you will know, I think, that we are taking steps to move to a new more real form of Question Time to reflect the new situation we find ourselves in after the entry into force o", "Election of Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament (continuation) \nPresident\nI now announce the results of the vote on the seniority of the Vice-Presidents.\nThe number voting: 703\nVoid or invalid voting slips: 7\nVotes cast: 696\nThe votes were cast as follows:\nRodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou: 322 votes\nAlejo Vidal-Quadras: 300 votes\nG\u00e9rard Onesta: 285 votes\nEdward McMillan-Scott: 274 votes\nMario Mauro 262 votes\nMiguel Angel Mart\u00ednez Mart\u00ednez: 260 votes\nLuigi Cocilovo: 234 votes\nMechtild Rothe: 217 votes\nLuisa Morgantini: 207 votes\nPierre Moscovici: 207 votes\nManuel Ant\u00f3nio dos Santos: 193 votes\nDiana Wallis: 192 votes\nMarek Siwiec: 180 votes\nAdam Bielan: 128 votes\nCongratulations to all the Vice-Presidents: I hope we will work well together in the Bureau of this House.\nIn accordance with Rule 14(2) of the Rules of Procedure, the Vice-Presidents rank in order of the votes cast for them, and where there is a tie, the Member older in years of age takes precedence.\n", "Statement by the President\nPresident\nPerhaps I might make a comment to the topic we have just discussed. Yesterday - Sunday, March the eleventh - was the third anniversary of the terrorist attack in Madrid on 11 March 2004, when 192 people were killed. The day of this appalling event has become a European day of commemoration for the victims of terrorism. It is a day for keeping memory alive - the memory of the victims of terrorism - and for solidarity with them and their families, with those who lost their lives and also with those who still suffer the effects of it, whether physical or psychological.\nIt is a day for fostering awareness, for, following the attack on Madrid, the bombings in London on 7 July 2005 resulted in more victims within the European Union, and, elsewhere around the world, too, it is still too often the case that too many people are being killed by violence motivated by fanaticism. Terrorism is an attack on freedom and democracy. Terrorism is an attempt at making things happened through blind violence and, in the process, destroying values, the values that are the foundation of the European Union and its Member States. Terrorism is a crime that cannot be tolerated under any circumstances. It represents one of the greatest dangers to the security, stability and democratic values of the international community and is also a direct assault on our citizens.\nThe European Union and the international community of states must be determined in fighting terrorism in whatever shape or form. There can be no justification for terrorism, and, in fighting it, we can allow ourselves no weakness; that is why we need a strong and united Europe. If we are to fight it effectively, we need to go beyond mere close cooperation and develop a coherent common policy that meets the needs of the public while also reflecting our understanding of human rights and human dignity.\nLet me, then, say once more that this House does not see Guantanamo as compatible with our Europ", "CAP simplification (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on CAP simplification by James Nicholson, Janusz Wojciechowski, on behalf of the ECR Group, Albert De\u00df, on behalf of the PPE Group, and George Lyon, on behalf of the ALDE Group - B7-0566/2010).\nAlbert De\u00df\nMadam President, Mr Ciolo\u015f, I am pleased that you are here today to answer questions. On 18 May, the European Parliament adopted with a large majority a resolution to simplify the common agricultural policy (CAP). Of course, it has not been possible for you to implement this resolution yet, but I would like to ask you, Mr Ciolo\u015f, to take into consideration all the demands made in this motion for a resolution when you begin restructuring agricultural policy.\nUnfortunately, I have to point out one fly in the ointment. I have just had a discussion with a group of farmers who were concerned that your proposals for the first pillar, Mr Ciolo\u015f, would not reduce the amount of red tape, but could instead lead to a huge increase in bureaucracy.\nThe European Union cannot be held responsible for every piece of red tape, Mr Ciolo\u015f. A large proportion of the responsibility lies with the Member States. This is why I am asking you to ensure that we can work together on the forthcoming reform so that it is structured in such a way that it can be implemented with as little administrative and supervisory effort as possible. This will allow farmers to focus on their main job, in other words, producing food, rather than requiring them to check the current legislation to find out what they need to be aware of before they do anything out in their fields or their barns.\nIn no other agricultural area in the world are farmers burdened with so many requirements and regulations as in the European Union. You are not yet responsible for this, Mr Ciolo\u015f. You have the chance to be the first Commissioner - before you eventually step down, and I do not know when that will happen - who can say ", "EU action on oil exploration and extraction in Europe (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council by Jo Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the implications of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill for the EU: action on oil extraction and exploration in Europe (B7-0470/2010), and the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Jo Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the implications of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill for the EU: action on oil extraction and exploration in Europe (B7-0551/2010).\nJo Leinen\nMadam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Gulf of Mexico has probably suffered one of the biggest environmental disasters of recent years, and we in Europe - in the European Union - must do everything we can to ensure that such a disaster cannot happen here. I believe we are in agreement on that. We have four seas adjoining the EU or situated within the EU: the North Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Oil drilling takes place in these European waters. In this regard, the subject is also an issue for the European Union.\nDeep-sea drilling especially represents a particular risk. That has become evident from the oil well in the Gulf of Mexico. There are problems here that are beyond our control. A great many outstanding questions have arisen to which we still do not have answers. Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, that is why we are recommending to you in our resolution that it would be appropriate to have a moratorium at least on new applications for deep-sea drilling until such time as we have a complete overview of what is needed and how we can close the gaps and remedy the shortcomings.\nI believe that the citizens of Europe expect us to ensure an equally high level of security for all 27 Member States, and thus for all four seas of the EU, and that there is no gap between countries tha", "3. Application of the Schengen acquis relating to the Schengen Information System (vote) \n- Report: Coelho\n- Before the vote:\nCarlos Coelho \nrapporteur. - (PT) Just three brief remarks if I may: a thank-you, a warning and a point of information. I should like to thank all those MEPs from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and all the political groups, whose goodwill enabled this report to be adopted quickly. I should like, too, to thank the Portuguese Government - and in particular Secretary of State Jos\u00e9 Magalh\u00e3es - for taking the initiative and putting forward this system whereby new Member States that fulfil the Schengen assessment criteria do not have to remain unjustly suspended and can join the system immediately.\nSecondly, speaking on behalf of Parliament as its rapporteur, I would like to sound a warning to the Council and the Commission. In our opinion, this transitional measure must never be allowed to hinder the rapid conclusion of SIS II, which must not be delayed and must remain a priority in view of the value-added and important innovation it encompasses for our collective security.\nThird and lastly, a point of information. I should like to draw the attention of the Council and the Commission to the need to exert pressure on the Member States. Each Member State is responsible for getting ready to enter the system and to remove internal borders. Entering the Schengen system means that we have mutual trust when it comes to monitoring our external borders. During this Schengen assessment process there is no place for political agreements between governments to water down criteria and requirements. This is not an exercise in sympathy. This is about our shared security, and the security of Europe's citizens is not something to be dealt with lightly.\n", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nAstrid Lulling\n(FR) Madam President, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is trying desperately to contest the competence of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality on the question of equality between men and women in the workplace. It has seized our initiative to draft a report on the discriminatory effects of pay differentials and other inequalities on women's pensions and on the trend towards the individualisation of social security rights.\nThe outcome is a hotchpotch report which strings together universally known generalities. We are a long way from the unequal treatment of women on pensions and the remedies on which the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality wished to predicate its report. As the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights on the basis of Rule 47 of the Rules of Procedure, I did my best, with the unanimous support of the Committee on Women's Rights, to propose specific corrections within the framework of the pension system reforms. There are six very precise corrections designed to plug the gaps in women's insurance as a result, for example, of maternity and their family commitments.\nCan you believe that the Committee on Employment expressly rejected them, in flagrant contradiction of its obligations under Rule 47? I am sorry that we have lost a battle, but the war and our fight will continue.\nPhilip Claeys\n(NL) Madam President, I have voted against the Klamt report for the simple reason that the entire concept of economic immigration and what is being referred to as the 'blue card' bears witness to short-term thinking. We should, instead, adopt a policy of training, re-training and getting the approximately 20 million unemployed that are currently in the European Union back into jobs. We should, instead, learn from our past mistakes. A case in point is the importing of guest workers and their families in the 70s and 80s, which turned into a major s", "3. China: Minority rights and application of the death penalty (vote) \nBernd Posselt\n(DE) Mr President, excuse me, but there is an error in paragraph 3 of the German version and I would like to ask you to have it corrected there and, if necessary, in all the other language versions. The German version reads: 'Condemns the execution of the two Tibetans and another nine Uighurs'. Of course, this is incorrect. Uighurs are not other Tibetans and Tibetans are not other Uighurs. I would like to ask you to have this corrected in all the language versions.\nPresident\nMr Posselt, thank you, that will be corrected.\nPresident\nThat concludes the vote.\n", "Implementing measures (level 2) of the \"Transparency\" and \"Prospectus\" directives (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the Implementing measures (level 2) for the 'Transparency' and 'Prospectus' directives.\nCharlie McCreevy\nMr President, allow me to address two measures proposed by the Commission on which Parliament will vote tomorrow. They concern the postponement of the decision on the equivalence of third country accounting standards - we aim to reach that decision by July 2008 - and the general implementation measures for the Transparency Directive.\nI would first like to thank the rapporteurs for their efficient and helpful work on these important and sensitive matters. Along with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, they have worked very constructively with the Commission and all parties concerned. The careful work of Parliament has demonstrably improved the legal texts. I would also like to thank the Committee of European Securities Regulators for its excellent work. The draft measures now represent a balanced and efficient solution.\nFirstly, on equivalence: postponing our decision on equivalence will not only ensure that EU markets remain open while work on convergence is ongoing, but will also allow us to work actively with United States and other third country authorities towards the elimination of reconciliation requirements for EU issuers abroad. This is and will remain our number one objective.\nThe additional two years will enable us to align the equivalence decision with the Securities and Exchange Commission's timeline in its roadmap towards eliminating the need for reconciliation between IFRS and US GAAP. The United States authorities are committed to working towards the recognition of equivalence of IFRS and US GAAP. With the new timing of the equivalence decisions, we will be able to work in parallel towards common agreed objectives.\nIn this context, it is important to emphasise that nothing is predetermined. W", "2. European External Action Service (\nPresident\nI would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Brok, and also our negotiators: Mr Brok, Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Gualtieri. This was a major piece of work, and many European Parliament committees also contributed. We have achieved a broad consensus. I would like to thank everyone. I would also like to point out that in the near future we will have the two important reports being drafted by Mrs Gr\u00e4\u00dfle and Mr Rapkay, so we have to keep working on this.\n", "2. Public passenger transport services by rail and road (vote) \n- Report: Meijer\n- Before the vote on Amendment 66:\nMathieu Grosch\n(DE) Mr President, the oral amendment is in the name of Mr Piecyk and on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament. Referring to the English text, which reads, 'operator shall be required to perform a major part', the term 'major part' is to be replaced by 'a substantial part'. This is a minor alteration, but one that can help us achieve a compromise between the Council, the Commission and this House following the unofficial trilogue.\nPaolo Costa\n(IT) Mr President, we cannot accept this oral amendment because it radically alters the sense of the compromise reached within the informal trialogue. I therefore ask my colleagues to rise.\n(Parliament rejected the oral amendment)\nMathieu Grosch\n(DE) Mr President, since this oral amendment was not adopted, I would like to ask that, when voting on Amendment 66, we should vote on the English text, since the German and French versions do not adequately express certain nuances. I therefore move that we vote on the English wording and that the translations be reviewed later on.\nPresident\nIf there is no objection, the authentic text will be the English version.\nErik Meijer \nrapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, had I been given the speaking time I had requested before Amendment 67 was put to the vote, this could have cleared up a misunderstanding.\nDuring the negotiations between 12 and 24 April, agreement was reached with the German Presidency of the Council about the prospective use, in Amendments 66 and 67, of the word 'significant' as a condition for subcontracting. The presidency offered the term 'substantial' by way of an alternative, but the two largest groups eventually had no need for it. They later decided, without consulting the rapporteur, to insert the word 'major' in the amendments jointly tabled by six groups.\nAlthough I agree with the substance of it, I have always warned that", "Specific tasks for the European Central Bank concerning the functioning of the European Systemic Risk Board - Powers of the European Banking Authority, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority - European Securities and Markets Authority - Macro-prudential oversight of the financial system and establishment of a European Systemic Risk Board - European Banking Authority - European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority - Cross-Border Crisis Management in the Banking Sector (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following:\nthe report by Mr Tremosa i Balcells, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Regulation entrusting the European Central Bank with specific tasks concerning the functioning of the European Systemic Risk Board [05551/2010 - C7-0014/2010 -;\nthe report by Mr S\u00e1nchez Presedo, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directives 1998/26/EC, 2002/87/EC, 2003/6/EC, 2003/41/EC, 2003/71/EC, 2004/39/EC, 2004/109/EC, 2005/60/EC, 2006/48/EC, 2006/49/EC and 2009/65/EC in respect of the powers of the European Banking Authority and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority - C7-0251/2009 -;\nthe report by Mr Giegold, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a European Securities and Markets Authority - C7-0167/2009 -;\nthe report by Mrs Goulard, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Community macro-prudential oversight of the financial system and establishing a European Systemic Risk Board - C7-0166/2009 -;\nthe report by Mr Garc\u00eda-Margallo y Marfil, on behalf of the Committee on Economic a", "4th report on economic and social cohesion - Territorial Agenda and the Leipzig Charter (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on\nthe report by Mr Guellec, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the fourth report on economic and social cohesion,\nand\nthe report by Mrs Kallenbach, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the Follow-up of the Territorial Agenda and the Leipzig Charter: Towards a European Action Programme for Spatial Development and Territorial Cohesion.\nAmbroise Guellec\nrapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this morning we are discussing two parliamentary initiative reports, but I feel both of them are extremely important for a number of reasons.\nFirstly, we are considering the Commission's Fourth Report on Social and Economic Cohesion. This is a truly remarkable document, much better than the previous versions, and it constitutes a firm basis for all manner of reflections on the future of cohesion within Europe. It is also important because the brand new Lisbon Treaty establishes territorial cohesion as one of the EU's main objectives. As we know, new and formidable challenges are now looming together with those we are already aware of, and cohesion policy must make a major worthwhile contribution to their consideration, to allow us to move forward to the Europe we want to see: that is, an effective, solidarity-conscious Europe.\nWhat does the Fourth Report show us? That social and economic convergence between the Member States is moving in the right direction, with a definite reduction in discrepancies in terms of income and jobs over the last decade, but also that there are still considerable disparities between regions, and occasionally within regions, with a frequent tendency to become more acute. Development is real enough, but is plagued by far too many imbalances. It is here that the new concept of territorial cohesion comes into its own, and this is where it must tak", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 19 April 1996.\n\nTribute\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, it is my sad duty to inform you of the death of Mr Robert Hersant on 21 April 1996. Mr Hersant was chairman of the Robert Hersant press group. From 1956 to 1978 he was a member of the French National Assembly. In the direct elections of 1984, 1989 and 1994 Mr Hersant was elected to the European Parliament and was a member of the Group of the European People's Party in this House. He was a member of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment. Our sympathy goes to his family, his parliamentary group and all his friends. I now ask you to rise for one minute to honour his memory.\n(Parliament rose and observed one minute's silence)\n\nMcNally\nMr President, I wish to raise a point of order under Rule 102(2). Yesterday, as on many previous occasions, there was no interpretation into or out of Finnish or Swedish in the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, despite the fact that a member of the committee from Finland was presenting a report and had to deal with very detailed amendments.\nAs an English speaker, I condemn this discourtesy to other Members of Parliament. It is very discriminatory that they should be forced to present their views in a foreign language. I urge you, Mr President, to ensure in future that where a Member has to present a report they are able to do so in their own language even if this means taking interpreting staff from another committee for the period concerned. The committee views this with the greatest concern. All speakers in this Parliament are entitled to speak in their mother tongue whether that language is spoken by many or by few.\n\nMacartney\nMr President, I want to say something about the celebration of an important day tomorrow, i.e. Schuman Day, Europe Day or Peace in Europe Day.

I would also like to thank you, Madam President.\nBreast cancer was on the agenda three years ago, and it is now time to take an initial look at the results, which appears to be urgently necessary. In the 25 Member States, 275 000 women contract breast cancer every year. The risk of dying from it is twice as high in one Member State as in another. To make it worse, younger and younger women are contracting the disease: just in the last few years, the number of women under 40 affected has doubled. Breast cancer is still the number one cause of death in women between 35 and 55.\nHowever, I am also shocked at how radical treatment still is in many Member States. In some countries, mastectomies are still the rule rather than the exception, even in the very early stages of the disease, even though in 80% of cases these days it is possible to operate without removing the breast. As you can see, then, we are progr", "3. Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) and the Office (\nCatherine Trautmann\nMadam President, I asked that we also be able to vote on the compromise, as it has a broader scope than Amendment 46 alone. You decided not to put this compromise to the vote without giving us any explanation and without giving any reply to the rapporteur. I wanted you to be aware of this and to tell you that I regret that our recommendation has not been followed, just like the rapporteur's recommendation on our House's vote.\nI would also like to say - to explain the vote that has just taken place - that when any part of the entire compromise is not adopted, it is the whole package that is subject to conciliation. That is the consequence of the vote that is being taken today.\nPresident\nThank you, Mrs Trautmann, I think the House understands the consequences of what it has done, but I thank you, nevertheless, for pointing that out. It would not have been appropriate to take the other compromise and, indeed, the vote was more than clear.\n\n", "2009 progress report on Croatia - 2009 progress report on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia - 2009 progress report on Turkey (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the Council and Commission statements on the:\n2009 progress report on Croatia\n2009 progress report on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\n2009 progress report on Turkey\nDiego L\u00f3pez Garrido\nMr President, I would like to begin by reiterating the firm commitment of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to the enlargement of the European Union. Our work in this respect will follow the line of the renewed consensus on enlargement approved at the December 2006 European Council and the Council conclusions of 8 December 2009, which have also been endorsed by the European Council.\nAs highlighted in this House's resolution, which we are now going to debate, the first half of this year will be crucial for the negotiations with Croatia. They have entered their final phase, yet much remains to be done before we can reach a successful conclusion. We are going to have to look at difficult chapters such as those on competition, fisheries, the judiciary and fundamental rights, the environment, and foreign security and defence policy. We will also have to close provisionally some chapters with financial implications.\nTherefore, a great deal of work lies ahead. New Commissioner, \u0160tefan F\u00fcle, who was a former colleague of mine when I was Europe Minister - and I would like to welcome him and congratulate him on his appointment - is going to be extremely busy with the enlargement issue as far as Croatia is concerned, because as soon as next week, we plan to hold an initial intergovernmental conference at ministerial level to open the chapters on fisheries and the environment, two very important chapters that, as you can imagine, will require an enormous amount of work and dedication.\nAllow me to remind you about the conclusions on Croatia adopted by the Council in December.

Mexico is a close partner of the European Union and this meeting is taking place at an important time in relations between Mexico and the European Union. The Lima Summit last weekend showed that we have many common interests. I also had the opportunity to speak with your President, Felipe Calder\u00f3n.\nThe Joint Parliamentary Committee will also be discussing climate change this afternoon, so I am sure that this plenary debate will be followed by you with interest.

I have not met Mr Samecki before, so I am interested that he is here to provide an answer to an issue that Mr McCreevy and his team have been working on. Thank you very much.\nI was going to have welcomed Mr McCreevy here and thanked him for his work previously, so perhaps you will pass on our good wishes for what might have been his final appearance here. Nevertheless, I am particularly pleased that Mr Barnier has joined us as a very active member of my committee to hear this, because this is a dossier which will be very much in his in-tray, assuming of course that the Parliament approves his nomination and the Commission moves forward. It is nevertheless very good that he is here.\nThe free movement of professionals and the Directive on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications are among the flagship issues that my committee is most concerned about in the whole construction of the single market. It is very appropriate that we are discussing this question to the Commission this morning, which is essentially to ask for an update on the progress in transposing the revised directive that my committee worked on back in 2004-2005, and on how that is actually being implemented by the Member States. It is also very timely because Professor Monti came to our c", "17.

Therefore, I would like to recall today that 8 August 2001 is the anniversary of a tragedy: the 45th anniversary of the terrible accident which took place in the Marcinelle mines. On 8 August 1956, 262 miners died in the most tragic accident in the workplace ever to take place in Europe: 262 miners from all over our continent. I am sure, Madam President, that you will want to take suitable measures to mark the anniversary of this tragic event, and I am also sure that the Belgian presidency, which has announced that its programme will include the creation of an equitable social Europe, will make every endeavour to ensure that this proposal establishes the conditions necessary to prevent a tragedy such as that of Marcinelle ever occurring in Europe again.\n\nPresident\nThank you, Mr Cossutta.\n\nThyssen\nMadam President, I learned yesterday that the Bureau was to make a statement today about the memorandum being prepared by this House on enlargement. You have a great sensitivity for language, Madam President, and you are more aware than anyone that the choice we are about to make on language regulation is the key to a great many other decisions that will have to be taken. Can you assure us that in the future all elected members of this House will continue to have the right to express themselves in their own language, to listen to their fellow-MEPs in their own language and to write in their own language? That would be a great help in setting our minds at rest.\n\nPresident\nMrs Thyssen, I have noted what you say. But having said that, I must explain to you that the Bureau will not be adopting the document you mentioned this evening. It will not be until September, when the groups have been able to study it in depth.\n\nVan Dam\nMadam President, I should like to draw your attention to the increasing and continuing problems faced by our drivers.

This is a particularly sensitive issue, with reservations on the part of the Member States, which have always reaffirmed their sovereignty over their airspace. That is especially true of the Member States - and I know of one that is dear to me, my own country - which have large military forces and military airspace blocks reserved in a virtually discretionary fashion.\nMr Costa is concerned that, as we might have feared, no progress has been made, as far as he can see, on that text on the creation of airspace blocks, one of the four on the Single Sky, and it has met with strong resistance from the Member States. Mr Costa is therefore putting the following question to the Commission. The Commission has just produced a communication making it clear that the cost of not having function", "Formal sitting - Georgia\nPresident\nMr President of the Republic of Georgia, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome you most warmly on behalf of the European Parliament.\nThree years ago, following parliamentary elections annulled by the regime of the time, the Rose Revolution took place in your country and history will associate your name with that revolution, Mr Saakashvili.\nLed by yourself, your compatriots demanded fair elections and an end to the corruption and bad governance that was ruining your country.\n(Applause)\nAlthough the previous regime refused to accept your demands, it was brought down without a single drop of blood being shed. 'People power' prevailed and the Georgian people were able to elect you en masse as the new President.\nMr President, the European Parliament has supported democratic change in your country. We sent a mission of observers to the elections and our Committee on Foreign Affairs had the pleasure of receiving you soon after your inauguration as President, not here in Strasbourg but at our site in Brussels.\nThe Rose Revolution reawakened hopes for real and free democracy in areas even further east of the Baltic, of Central and of Eastern Europe.\nA year later, the Orange Revolution took place in Ukraine. At that time the future seemed full of promise, but we are now seeing that many problems and obstacles have arisen on a journey that is certainly no easy ride.\nYou have achieved a great deal over the years that have passed since then, but the conflicts in the break-away regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia have become worse.\nIt is clear that Russia is now putting great pressure on your country - I can tell you that your country was discussed at great length at the dinner with President Putin - and you now have a great opportunity, on addressing the European Parliament, to explain the situation so that the representatives of the peoples of Europe can hear directly from you about the difficult circumstances being experienced by yo", "Closure of sitting\nPresident\nThank you, again, to our interpreters and technicians today.\nI declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.\n(The sitting closed at 12.05)\n", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nDavid Sumberg\nMr President, I rise in respect of the Martens report, because its title, 'One year after Lisbon', gives me the opportunity to reflect on where we are, one year after Lisbon, in the European Union. Where we are is in absolute chaos: we cannot respond to the economic crisis; there is a return to protectionism, particularly by the Government of France, and there now has to be a recognition that the Lisbon Treaty is not merely wrong but is ineffective.\nWe have listened - or we should have listened - to the people of Ireland, who made it perfectly clear in their referendum that they did not want this Treaty. But, if we did not listen before, we should listen now. This is a Treaty that is unloved, unwanted and, most importantly, ineffective, and this Parliament should recognise the fact.\nNirj Deva\nMr President, I am very conscious that the Treaty of Lisbon is, as my colleague David Sumberg has just said, a train wreck as regards the European Union.\nHowever, I want to focus on the excellent report that Maria Martens has produced. It talks about something very fundamental in the way we disburse our aid. Maria Martens has identified that, if national parliaments in the ACP countries are not empowered to look at the country strategy papers and discuss them in a transparent fashion, then the funds that the EU provides ACP countries could be used in the wrong way. It gives power to the national parliaments in ACP countries to scrutinise the development assistance that is being provided, in the same way that the Lisbon Treaty should have given more power to national parliaments within the EU to scrutinise what we are doing here. Ms Martens' report takes into account accountability and transparency, so I support it.\nSyed Kamall\nMr President, I agree with my colleague who spoke previously, Mr Sumberg, when he reflects on the Lisbon Treaty and where we are one year after Lisbon itself.

I hope the House can support that amendment.\nGerard Batten\nMr President, I notice that there were a large number of people holding up banners.

It reads: 'Say no to the European Union'.\n(Applause from the EFD Group)\nCan we have one set of rules that applies for everybody, please? Is that possible?\nPresident\nI think you have made your point. Everybody knows and noticed that you say 'no' to the European Union.\n", "14. Protocol amending TRIPS (vote) \n- Recommendation: Susta\n- Before the vote:\nCarl Schlyter\nMr President, the basis for agreement with the Council on this report was a statement made by the Commission which was supposed to be read out yesterday during the debate. However, that statement was not read out. If the Council would agree to attach it to the Minutes or give it some kind of legal status and transparency, then that would help further the process on this issue.\nManuel Lobo Antunes\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, access to affordable pharmaceutical products in poor developing countries and LDCs is essential to attain the proposed EU development goals and would contribute to poverty reduction, increase human security and promote human rights and sustainable development. I think we both agree on the importance of ensuring the coherence of EU policies and that consistency in the EU's external actions, namely trade and development policies, should go hand in hand.\nWe recognise that the mechanism created by the WTO decision and the protocol to the TRIPS Agreement represent just a part of the solution to the problem of access to medicines and public health, and that other measures to improve health care and infrastructure are equally indispensable. Even if the TRIPS amendment is not the complete solution, we believe that the positive acceptance of the protocol represents an important step.\nTo this effect, it is worth recalling that the Member States of the European Union remain free under WTO rules to use the different exceptions provided under the TRIPS Agreement in their domestic patent laws, including those provided for under Article 30 of the TRIPS Agreement.\nFurthermore, in order to facilitate access to medicines in countries with insufficient or no manufacturing capacities in the pharmaceutical sector, the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission all worked hard to adopt Regulation (EC) No 816/2006 on compulsory licensing of pate", "9. Ombudsman's 2005 annual report (vote) \n- before the vote:\nAndreas Schwab \nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, I would like to raise a point of order. This morning, we discussed with the European Ombudsman the question of what powers he possessed to monitor EPSO, the European personnel agency, and he confirmed that he exercises such functions by virtue of his office. I would therefore like to make a request of the Members with whom we debated this morning, namely that we should agree to adopt Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou's Amendment 1 on the grounds that it confirms what the European Ombudsman said.\n", "Commemoration of the 1956 Hungarian uprising\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, I would now like to make a statement, and I shall do so standing, on the 'Hungarian Revolution' of October 1956.\nHalf a century ago, the Hungarian people rose up against the Communist dictatorship and against the occupation by a foreign power.\nOn 23 October 1956, Hungarian university students took to the streets of Budapest to protest against the Communist government and they were soon joined by citizens from all professions and sectors of society.\nI must tell you that that is my earliest childhood memory of politics. At that time, the news in my country was full of the resistance by the Hungarian people. I can remember our school teacher showing us where the events were taking place on a map, the voices on the radio and photographs in the newspapers of burnt-out T-34 tanks in the centre of Budapest. It brought alive in me for the first time the notion of fighting for freedom.\nFor two weeks there was hope; then the radios stopped and a complete silence fell, and behind that silence thousands were killed and hundreds exiled. For some time those who rose up in Budapest hoped that the free West would come to their aid. It did not. For some time, they were led to believe that it would.\nWe looked on as powerless spectators as thousands of Hungarian men, women and children fled their country and sought refuge in the West. It was an indescribable tragedy for the Hungarian people, but it was also the first chink in the armour of the Soviet system - a chink that would grow and would lead to the fall of the Berlin Wall - and it was undoubtedly a great moment in the history of that country.\nAround that time, at the end of June, the Poznan uprising in Poland, with the workers from the Cigielski factory demanding 'bread and freedom', was another significant moment in that upheaval. Those events were undoubtedly related. In fact, during the ceremony organised this year to commemorate the events in Poznan", "Statements by the President\nPresident\nWe have been saddened by news of the murder in Mexico of the Finnish international human rights observer Jyri Antero Jaakola. He and Mexican activist Betty Cari\u00f1o Trujillo, who was accompanying him at the time, were murdered during a mission to monitor the observance of human rights in Mexico. On behalf of the European Parliament, I offer condolences and expressions of sympathy to the victims' families. As we can see, the world we live in still entails sacrifices such as these.\nI am sure you are aware that last week I made an official visit to the US. I officially opened Parliament's new Liaison Office with the United States Congress in Washington. I also had many important talks which should contribute to closer cooperation, especially economic cooperation, between the European Union and the United States. We also talked about strategic partnership and about the changes which have taken place in the European Union following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. We expect cooperation with the United States to take place on equal terms.\nThis Sunday, 9 May, is the 60th anniversary of the Schumann Declaration. To mark this event, the European Parliament will open its doors to all those interested on Saturday 8 May in Brussels, and on Sunday in Strasbourg. There will also be ceremonies to commemorate this event in Luxembourg. In Strasbourg, among other visitors we will have one of the Vice-Presidents of the Commission and the French and German Ministers for European Affairs. I, too, will be there, and I would like to encourage all of you to come to Strasbourg this Sunday, in four days' time.\n", "\n\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013 The next item is the oral question by Joost Lagendijk and Gisela Kallenbach, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, Hannes Swoboda and Jan Marinus Wiersma, on behalf of the PSE Group, Doris Pack, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, and Elizabeth Lynne, Sarah Ludford and Jelko Kacin, on behalf of the ALDE Group, to the Council, on the EU's preparedness for its future role in Kosovo (O-0082/2006 \u2013 B6-0426/2006). \nJoost Lagendijk (Verts/ALE ),\n\u00a0\u00a0 . Mr President, may I put a point of order? Is it not the Council\u2019s, the Minister\u2019s, intention to respond first to the question that has been raised? The question that has already been put to the Council is clear. Members will be given the opportunity to react to the Council\u2019s response in due course. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013 I must point out that the services have confirmed that in all cases, before the Council replies, the authors of the question shall present the substance of their query in order to move the question itself. \nJoost Lagendijk (Verts/ALE ),\n\u00a0\u00a0 . Mr President, most of these questions have been raised following a visit by a Parliamentary delegation in June. During that visit, we got the impression that whilst the European Union is present and is getting geared up for the task which, as we all know, will be vital to Kosovo's future, the energy that is being invested in it and the attention given to it leave a great deal to be desired in a number of areas. This covers a number of issues.\nFirst of all, whilst the European Union is clearly making thorough preparations in the areas of security and justice, with a view to taking over the tasks of the UN, UNMIC, we are of the opinion that it is not in the areas of security and justice, however important that they may be, that the EU will be playing an important role. What is equally important, for example, is coordinating all the efforts of the international community, continuing to help in the construction of a civil administration and, crucially, monitoring complianc", "2. Nicaragua (vote) \n- Before the vote\nManuel Medina Ortega\nSome requests have been submitted on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament for a split vote on paragraphs 1 and 4, as well as some proposals for oral amendments, namely on paragraph 2, recital A and recital F. I am sure the President is aware of this, but if not I could explain it to her.\nManuel Medina Ortega\nIn paragraph 2 we would like to include an oral amendment specifying the municipalities in which the disturbances are happening, which are Le\u00f3n and Managua: it would read 'municipalities (Le\u00f3n and Managua)'.\n(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)\n- Before the vote on recital \u0391\nManuel Medina Ortega\nWith regard to the text of recital A, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament was proposing an oral amendment to put 'allegation' in the singular, instead of the plural 'allegations'.\n(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)\n- Before the vote on recital F\nManuel Medina Ortega\nIn recital F, instead of 'criminal investigations', we propose 'judicial investigations'; in other words, we propose replacing 'criminal' with 'judicial'.\n", "Presentation by the Council of the draft general budget - Budget 2009 (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the presentation by the Council of the draft general budget for 2009. I therefore welcome \u00c9ric Woerth, Minister for the Budget, Public Accounts and the Civil Service, as the representative of the Council Presidency.\n\u00c9ric Woerth\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is both an honour and a pleasure for me to speak in your House today for two reasons: firstly, because your Parliament represents the heart of European democracy. The French Presidency has a tremendous amount of respect and admiration for the work that you have done in support of European integration, and the best possible proof of our willingness to help Europe move forward together was provided by the French President in his speech in Strasbourg in July. It is this same spirit that guides me and is shared by my colleagues in the French Government. Secondly, because the draft budget for 2009, which I am presenting to you today, was adopted unanimously by the Council on 17 July. This unanimity shows that this draft budget is balanced and that it allows all EU governments to identify with it.\nOur initial contacts have provided a sound basis for the continuation of the budgetary procedure. The trialogue and conciliation meetings have taken place in a constructive atmosphere. We have already reached agreement on six statements, and I am sure that we shall be able to agree on many other matters of common interest.\nI can assure you that the Council is prepared to continue this high-quality dialogue with a view to securing an agreement on the 2009 budget that is satisfactory to all.\nThis agreement should comply with three principles: the first is to ensure the financing of the European Union's policy priorities - and we have established a financial framework for the period from 2007 to 2013 that we must implement in order to achieve our objectives i", "14. Corporate social responsibility in international trade agreements (\nHarlem D\u00e9sir\nMr President, we are proposing a change to the beginning of paragraph 32 in agreement with the shadow rapporteurs. The first words of this paragraph would become - I will read it in English because we drew it up together in English:\n'Calls to explore, within the same forums, the elaboration of an international convention ..'.\n(FR), and the rest of the paragraph is unchanged.\n", "1. Drugs prevention and information (vote) \nSegelstr\u00f6m report\n- Before the vote:\nViviane Reding\nMember of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, I would like to made a statement on behalf of the Commission before the vote.\nAs regards the measures for implementing the Parliament and Council Decision establishing for the period 2007-2013 the specific programme 'Drug prevention and information', the Commission agrees as an exceptional measure to transmit as swiftly as possible to the chairman of the competent committee the draft annual work programmes relating to this specific programme, in addition to sending them via the comitology register. The Commission will inform Parliament as soon as possible of any amendments made to the texts following the committee meetings.\nPresident\nThank you, Commissioner Reding. As no motion to reject the common position has been tabled and there are no amendments, I declare the common position approved.\n", "Opening of the sitting (first sitting of the newly elected Parliament) \nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, under the terms of the Act concerning the election of the representatives of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage, I declare the first sitting of the European Parliament following the elections open.\n(Applause)\nI would ask you to rise for the European anthem.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I warmly welcome you to the first sitting of the European Parliament following the elections and congratulate you all: the re-elected Members and the newly elected Members. A little under half of the 736 Members have been elected to the European Parliament for the first time. It is particularly heartening that 35% of the Members are women - a percentage that has never been as high before in the European Parliament.\n(Applause)\n170 million citizens turned out to vote, and our work serves a great purpose: to unite our continent! In this work, we must never forget that the European Union is based on values. Human dignity, human rights, freedom, democracy, the rule of law and peace are the foundations of our actions. We are bound together by solidarity. I would ask you to ensure that mutual respect forever remains our guiding principle. If we do this, we are sure to succeed. Now let us get to work!\n", "Transatlantic relations: USA travel fee (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on Transatlantic relations: USA travel fee.\nOlivier Chastel\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again, I have the honour, this afternoon, of speaking on behalf of the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, and not on behalf of the Council, as it says on the screen.\nThe European Union and the United Sates attach a great deal of importance to ensuring that their citizens can travel easily from one side of the Atlantic to the other. Transatlantic mobility can be facilitated, to a large extent, if people can travel without obtaining a visa and without paying a fee. While US nationals can enter the Schengen area without having to obtain a visa, the same cannot be said of EU citizens wishing to enter the United States.\nFour Member States are still excluded from the benefit of the US Visa Waiver Programme: Bulgaria, Cyprus, Poland and Romania. However, we can celebrate the fact that Greece was included in this programme on 5 April. This happy outcome can be attributed to the Commission, which is doing its utmost to ensure that all Member States benefit from the exemption programme, and to the efforts of successive Presidencies to take this matter forward.\nThus, every year since 2006, the Commission has produced a report on all third countries that continue to require visas from our citizens in violation of the principle of reciprocity, since the European Union attaches a great deal of importance to the existence of total reciprocity in this area. As the European Union exempts certain third countries, they should do the same for our nationals.\nFurthermore, for security reasons which we fully understand, in early 2009, the United States decided to introduce the Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA), which can be used only for passengers from a country covered by the visa waiver programme who enter North America. Since 8 September, every one of th", "Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nKn\u00f6rr Borr\u00e0s\nMr President, I did not rise to speak yesterday at the beginning of the sitting, but I do wish to clarify an issue concerning something said by the President of this Parliament. With regard to the tabling of the so-called Antiterrorist Agreement in Spain, the presidency of this Parliament stated that this was signed by various associations and unions, and the Church was mentioned. I wish to state, for the information of everyone here, that this is not the case, despite the pressure exerted by the Government and the Socialist Party. This statement has not even been signed by organisations that support the government in Madrid and, with all due respect, I must say that this situation, which is discussed here with such frequency, the situation of the Basque country, is complex and it requires efforts to maintain dialogue. This is what was requested, for example, in the manifesto that I submitted to President Fontaine, signed by four thousand intellectuals and others involved in culture in Catalonia.\nLastly, I wish to say that the situation is so complex and is so finely shaded that even Mrs Fontaine' s own party is standing in municipal elections in France, in Bayonne, in Biarritz and in Anglet, in coalition with Basque nationalist parties, including Mr Gorostiaga' s party, which is no favourite of mine, but which I imagine is not a favourite of Mrs Fontaine' s either.\n\nTannock\nMr President, last Saturday Marie-Jos\u00e9 the last Queen of Italy and daughter of King Albert of this country died. She was a recognised democrat and historian. Sadly she did not live to see her exiled son and grandson allowed to return to their homeland. Thus her funeral shamefully could not take place in Italy as they would not be permitted to attend.\nThis Italian constitutional article has no place in modern Europe and is in clear breach of the", "8. European metrology research and development programme (\n- Before the vote:\nErika Mann\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reason we are able to conclude this procedure at first reading is that we have succeeded in bringing about excellent cooperation across the group divide and with the other institutions. For this, I should like to offer particular thanks to my fellow MEPs, the Council, the Commission, the secretariat of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, the European Economic and Social Committee and, of course, the large body of researchers behind it all.\nWe now have within reach concerted European research, in the context of future cooperation between the 22 National Metrology Institutes. This will introduce substantial Europeanisation into the important field of measurement. In addition, there is to be enhanced cooperation in future involving the five Member States not yet participating in this integration. We have achieved this by means of Article 169, which we apply when coordinating national and European research funding. Each amounts to EUR 200 million, and this will enable us to achieve cooperation between the nation-states.\nResearch in the field of measurement covers a wide range of fields, from diabetes to the nanotechnology or space fields, and will be important to the whole field of standard setting in relation to CO2 in future. So, then, I wish to reiterate my particular thanks to everyone involved. I hope that this will lead to enhanced European cooperation in this very important research area in future.\n", "Situations of fragility\nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on 'Towards an EU response to situations of fragility: engaging in difficult environments for sustainable development, stability and peace'.\nVladim\u00edr \u0160pidla\nMember of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, since July 2007, the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union have been working together closely to launch the process of preparing a more strategic and effective EU response to situations of fragility in partner countries.\nThis process should be pursued by future presidencies. The objective is not to label or classify countries, but to tailor their instruments and responses to specific situations. In these situations of fragility, there are major obstacles to poverty reduction. Institutional capabilities in such situations are very limited, with states unable to assume the functions of governance, or with the consequences of natural disasters, violent conflict, or a lack of political will on the part of the government regarding development objectives. In extreme cases, these situations can have an impact beyond the country's borders, affecting regional stability or even global security.\nThe idea of fragility is not new, though the international debate is relatively recent. Donors, partner countries and civil society have been aware for a long time of the need to be more effective in particularly unfavourable situations in order to meet the objectives of sustainable development.\nEvery situation is complex and different and requires a tailored response, in which diplomatic action, humanitarian aid, development cooperation, and security and crisis management intervention all play a part.\nThe effectiveness of the European Union's response requires a long-term commitment, but also the definition of clear objectives when taking action in a fragile country. The guiding principle should continue to be capability development and human security, within t", "9. Croatia: progress report 2008 (vote) \n- Before the vote on Amendment 13:\nHannes Swoboda\nThank you, Mr President. There have been a lot of discussions between the groups over the last few days, right down to the last minute in fact. The following amendment now seems to me to be the one that has the broadest agreement in this House and also, according to direct information which I have received, was voted on with the agreement of both Croatia and Slovenia.\nThe amendment reads as follows in English:\n'Recalls the informal agreement reached on 26 August 2007 by the Prime Ministers of Croatia and Slovenia on the submission of their border dispute to an international body; welcomes the readiness of Croatia and Slovenia to accept the mediation offer made by the Commission and takes the view that this mediation should be based on international law; in this context, looks forward to a rapid advancement of the accession negotiations;'.\n", "A more efficient and fairer retail market (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Anna Maria Corazza Bildt, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on a more efficient and fairer retail market.\nAnna Maria Corazza Bildt\nrapporteur. - Mr President, did you know that retail provides almost 20 million jobs and continued to employ throughout the crisis? Our report is about creating more jobs in Europe. The time has come to recognise that retailers are drivers of growth. Did you know, and can you imagine, that if you buy a toy in one Member State for your child, you have to retest it to get additional certification in another Member State? Did you know that you have to repack a cheese to market it on a cross-border basis? What a waste.\nOur report is about removing borders and barriers to the free movement of goods and services. This is the backbone of European integration and the single market. For the first time we are putting retail on the map of EU policy-making. This has never been done before. I am very grateful to shadows and colleagues who have made a great contribution in making a cross-political commitment to call for an action plan for retail, based on a long-term and holistic approach.\nI am really glad that this has been anchored in the new Single Market Act. We are not shying away from controversial issues: unfair commercial practices, private labels, extra fees, to name but a few, as well as tax and trade laws. I know how many colleagues care about people and consumers with reduced mobility or who live in remote and isolated areas or in town centres. We are calling for action on this as well.\nActually our entire report is a call for action. We are asking Member States to implement and enforce existing internal market legislation and competition law, goods packages, service directives, the Small Business Act and to remove the hidden and hideous new restrictions that have been put up in recent years.\nWe ", "Long-term plan for the anchovy stock in the Bay of Biscay and the fisheries exploiting that stock - Multiannual plan for the western stock of Atlantic horse mackerel and the fisheries exploiting that stock - Prohibition of highgrading and restrictions on fishing for flounder and turbot in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound - Use of alien and locally absent species in aquaculture (debate) \nPresident\n\u03a4he next item is the joint debate on the following reports:\nthe report by Izaskun Bilbao Barandica, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a long-term plan for the anchovy stock in the Bay of Biscay and the fisheries exploiting that stock - C7-0157/2009 -,\nthe report by Pat the Cope Gallagher, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a multiannual plan for the western stock of Atlantic horse mackerel and the fisheries exploiting that stock - C7-0010/2009 -,\nthe report by Marek J\u00f3zef Gr\u00f3barczyk, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 as regards the prohibition of highgrading and restrictions on fishing for flounder and turbot in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound - C7-0156/2010 -, and\nthe report by Jo\u00e3o Ferreira, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 708/2007 concerning the use of alien and locally absent species in aquaculture -.\nIzaskun Bilbao Barandica\nrapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, I would firstly like to acknowledge, thank and congratulate the inshore fishing sector of the Bay of Biscay for its responsible behaviour.\nCommissioner, the sector urgently needs this plan if it is to achieve its objective, namely, to carry on a profitable activity", "Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nGoebbels\nMr President, the French version of the Minutes for yesterday' s sitting state, on page 14, that we were to come back this morning to my request to postpone the voting on the Villiers report.\nI think the time has now come to do so. I proposed that we vote on the Villiers report in Brussels in November, because there are a number of rather sensitive amendments that I should not like to see voted in by random majorities.\n\nPresident\nThat is something we shall discuss presently. For the moment our business is to adopt the Minutes.\n(The Minutes were approved)\n\nVOTE\nGoebbels\nOnce again, Mr President, yesterday I requested that the vote on Mrs Villiers' report be postponed. It is a very important report which deserves better than to be discussed in an almost empty Chamber. I do regret the fact that some Members see fit to avoid turning up to the Friday sitting in Strasbourg, but since it does happen, if we go ahead and vote today, the outcome is likely to be based on the will of a random majority, which does no credit to this House either.\n\nPresident\nThe procedure requires us to hear the opinion of the Members of the House on this proposal. We shall hear one speaker for the motion and one against.\n\nVilliers\nMr President, I would like to speak in favour of Mr Goebbels' proposal. I leave this matter to the House. It is for you to decide whether you would like to postpone or not. Fridays in Strasbourg are a difficult issue for us, but today because of the sensitivity of the report - it raises issues about the general procedure of the House and our general relationship with the Commission - I personally think it would be better if the groups had an opportunity to vote when there were more Members present.\nI am sorry that there are not more Members present this morning. I would not ask this if I did not think that this was an imp", "One-minute speeches on matters of political importance\nPresident\nThe next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.\nMargaritis Schinas\n(EL) Mr President, competition policy is exclusively the responsibility of the European Commission. One may well wonder, then, why the Commission does not exercise this exclusive responsibility, when the price of oil has risen by 50% since the beginning of the year.\nThere is all the more reason for concern when the Commission is failing to exercise this responsibility on two fronts: externally, where an oil cartel is obviously playing a part in setting prices that are such a burden to the more vulnerable sections of the European population, and also internally, where another oil cartel is likewise maintaining excessively high prices, since the oil companies' profits remain over-inflated.\nI therefore call on the Commissioner for Competition to exercise her responsibilities in those specific areas where citizens expect it of her: in matters that affect their everyday lives.\n(Applause)\nGyula Hegyi\n(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President. Allergies are the epidemic of today, and have typically spread throughout Europe since the Second World War. Today, one third of children have an allergy and, if we do not do something about it, in time half the European population will suffer from this illness. Foods containing chemicals and the polluted environment are to blame for allergies. Allergic symptoms can, however, be triggered by natural and artificial food additives, spices, pollens and other natural substances.\nIn Hungary ragweed is the biggest problem. Unfortunately, the European Union does not currently have an allergy strategy, as the Commission has confirmed at my request. Civil society organisations for allergic illnesses and many millions of European citizens who are affected expect us to act against allergies at European level too, and for us to do something towards prevention, stopping the triggers and ensu", "Middle East peace process (continuation)\nPresident\nThe next item is the continuation of the Council and Commission statements on the Middle East peace process.\n\nPatten\nI am very grateful to the President of the Council for the statement this morning on the Middle East at the beginning of this debate and for hearing some of Minister Gama' s insights, as he arrived hot-foot from the region. My only regret is that my own commitment to open the European Reconstruction Agency on Monday meant that I could not take part myself in that trip to the Middle East, even though, as I mentioned earlier in the day - which is another story - events conspired to maroon me at Munich airport rather than transport me to Thessaloniki. Such is life.\nI hope that honourable Members will excuse me if I am not able to stay to the end of the debate as I would, in all normal circumstances, wish to do. The debate was fixed for this morning and on that basis I had arranged to see visitors from the Balkans this evening. So I hope I can count on the understanding of the House on this occasion. It is not something, I assure you, which I would wish to make a practice of.\nLike honourable Members, I welcome the United States' efforts that have relaunched the Syrian/Israeli negotiations, despite the Syrian decision that they needed more time before resuming the talks that were scheduled to start again today. There is reasonable hope that a basis for a peace agreement can be built in the near future. I also hope that progress in the Syrian track will pave the way for an early resumption of Lebanese/Israeli talks which could then advance in parallel towards an overall deal on Israel's relations with its northern neighbours.\nAt the same time we must not lose sight of the Palestinian track. The situation of the Palestinians has always been the core issue of the conflict. A fair and, indeed, generous deal with them remains the key to lasting peace in the Middle East. Israelis and Palestinians have made subst", "3. The effects of the global financial and economic crisis on developing countries and on development cooperation (\nBefore the vote:\nEnrique Guerrero Salom\nMr President, I would like to thank all of those who have taken part in the preparation of this report.\nI would just like to point out that when we get to paragraph 31, there is an oral amendment. As agreed, I will now read the second part of the English version.\n'Considers it appropriate, therefore, to explore the grounds for an agreement with creditor countries to establish a temporary moratorium or debt cancellation for the poorest countries to enable them to implement countercyclical fiscal policies to mitigate the severe effects of the crisis; proposes that efforts be made to facilitate arrangements for transparent debt arbitration'.\nPresident\nIn any case, Mr Guerrero, if we have not been misinformed, this oral amendment affects paragraph 34 and not paragraph 31.\n(Mr Guerrero indicated that it did indeed affect the second part of paragraph 34)\nNow it is all clear.\n(The vote took place)\n(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)\n- Before the vote on paragraph 22:\nCharles Goerens\n(FR) Mr President, we have brought to your attention an oral amendment concerning paragraph 22. I would point out that paragraph 22 relates to global governance and, in particular, to the composition of the G20, which, unusually, does not include in its ranks any representatives from the least developed countries.\nThe oral amendment aims to fill this gap, and the text that I propose to the European Parliament meets this need.\nDaniel Cohn-Bendit\n(FR) Mr President, you called for applause for the Tunisian delegation a moment ago. Could you ask the Tunisian delegation to intervene to obtain the release of Taoufik Ben Brik, which the whole of Parliament is calling for?\nHannes Swoboda\n(DE) Mr President, I would like to raise a point of order.

The word 'men's' should, then, be added.\n(The oral amendment was accepted)\nPresident. - That concludes the vote.\n", "Use of sexual violence in conflicts in North Africa and the Middle East\nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the use of sexual violence in conflicts in North Africa and the Middle East.\n\u0160tefan F\u00fcle\nMember of the Commission. - Madam President, we must reject in the strongest possible terms any targeting of violence against women, from intimidation to sexual assault. These are abhorrent crimes, often perpetrated against the most vulnerable and defenceless people.\nUnfortunately, it is a fact that many countries across the world, not only in North Africa and in the Middle East, still lack a proper legal framework to protect women and girls from violence. There is nothing to encourage the reporting of such attacks. Much more must be done to deter perpetrators and to hold them accountable for their actions. Women continue to endure discriminatory laws and deeply entrenched cultural inequality. In the case of Egypt, for example, the national committee formed to write the new constitution is composed only of men, and even the new cabinet has only one female minister.\nThis is not sustainable, as was made clear by the courage shown by Tunisian and Egyptian women during the recent events in their countries. If half the population is excluded from political and institutional reform, it can hardly succeed.\nAgainst this backdrop, we strongly condemn the increasing reports of severe human rights violations including rape, sexual assault and severe humiliation of women activists. The European Union is committed to strengthening the role of women in political, civil, social, economic and cultural spheres, as well as to fighting against discrimination and impunity. This is why one of the EU's eight Human Rights Guidelines explicitly aims to 'promote gender equality and combat discrimination against women'. And the Barcelona Declaration of 1995, which established the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, specifically reinforces this commitment for the Euromed region.\nGende", "1. Religious freedom in Pakistan\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on seven motions for resolutions on religious freedom in Pakistan.\nCharles Tannock\nauthor. - Madam President, Pakistan's inability to develop a strong and enduring democracy has impacted - quite severely, in my view - on religious freedom in that country. Successive leaders have used Islam to justify repression of minorities and justify autocracy, particularly of a military nature, although recent government efforts to remedy this must be recognised.\nPakistan's constitution, although nominally upholding religious freedom, still allows for laws such as the blasphemy laws, which are discriminatory towards non-Muslims, and the persecution of Shia and Ahmadiyya minorities is a common feature. The emphasis on religious identity that was the basis for the foundation of Pakistan, and its creation, sadly appears to foster a climate of intolerance and often even violence towards those outside the religious mainstream.\nThe proliferation of Deobandi madrasahs, preaching messages of hatred against the West, has created an environment in which extremism and fundamentalism flourish and too many EU citizens - including from my own country, the UK - have gone through their clutches. The clearest manifestation of this is the Pakistani Taliban, a terrorist movement whose intentions were again made only too clear recently in the, mercifully failed, Times Square bomb plot in New York.\nI fear personally that nothing will change in Pakistan until that country develops an education and political system that truly supports the principles of religious freedom, tolerance and equality.\nAnneli J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki\nauthor. - Madam President, my group, ALDE, welcomes the measures taken in the interests of religious minorities by the government of Pakistan since November 2008, and supports the efforts of the Federal Minister for Minorities in establishing a network of local inter-faith harmony committees to promote dialogue between re", "\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 25\u00a0September 2003.(1) \n\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 I am delighted to have the opportunity this afternoon to extend a warm welcome to Dr Jong-Wook Lee, the recently-elected Director-General of the World Health Organization, and his colleagues, who are in the official gallery this afternoon. It is Dr Lee's first visit to the European Parliament. I should like to thank you for being here, Dr Lee, and, through our respective mandates, I very much look forward to working with you in the future.\nOn behalf of the European Parliament, I would also like to welcome to our official gallery the Swedish Riksdag's Committee on the Constitution, its Chairman Mr Gunnar H\u00f6kmark and Vice-Chairman Mr G\u00f6ran Magnusson.\nOur colleagues from the Swedish Riksdag are very welcome here. I know they have already had a busy round of meetings this morning which will continue this afternoon and tomorrow morning. I should like to point out to you that this is the tenth committee delegation this year to come to the European Parliament from the Riksdag. We have great pleasure in welcoming you here, and our door is always open to do business with parliamentary colleagues.(1) \n\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 A corrigendum to the agenda of the sittings of 8 and 9 October 2003 has been distributed. Are there any comments? \nLehne (PPE-DE ).\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013 Mr President, the next item on the agenda is the oral question on the liberal professions. At the Conference of Presidents no agreement could be reached on a motion for a resolution to accompany this oral question. There have since been further discussions, and I think there is now a majority in this House in favour of an accompanying resolution. I would therefore like to propose voting on a resolution in the next Strasbourg week and would suggest that we set a deadline of 12 noon on Thursday of next week for the submission of motions for a resolution. \n\n(1)\n\nHowitt (PSE ).\n\u00a0\u00a0  Mr President, I would", "4. Review of the medical device directives (vote) \n- Before the vote:\nThomas Ulmer \nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those who have worked together so outstandingly well - the shadow rapporteurs, the Committee staff and the House administration, the Commission and the presidencies, both Finnish and German. We have succeeded in getting the crucial improvements on which we had decided accepted, those being the clarification of reprocessing, where the Commission has promised us a directive specifically relating to the subject; clarification of the position of software, of databases and the phasing out and labelling of carcinogenic and mutagenic substances.\nI now have two comments of a technical nature. First, there is an amendment to paragraph (4), in which, contrary to what had been agreed, part of a sentence had not been deleted. In English, this reads as follows:\n'and a correlation table between those provisions and this Directive'\n(DE) and the figure '12' which has to be replaced by '15'. Secondly, there is Amendment 87, where I ask you to vote against the first half, since an error has found its way into it. Doing so will not affect its substance.\n", "Preventing trafficking in human beings (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on\nthe oral question to the Council on preventing trafficking in human beings, by Anna Hedh and Edit Bauer, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality - B7-0341/2009), and\nthe oral question to the Commission on preventing trafficking in human beings, by Anna Hedh and Edit Bauer, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality - B7-0342/2009),\nAnna Hedh\nAs we are all aware, trafficking in human beings is one of the most serious and heinous crimes in the world. That is why I am very disappointed to be debating this important issue here so late in the evening before an empty chamber with no audience and no journalists.\nIn 1850, slavery was officially banned throughout Europe. Nonetheless, nearly 200 years later, hundreds of thousands of people are suffering the modern form of slavery that is trafficking in human beings in Europe. The European Parliament and the other EU institutions have a huge responsibility to combat and stop modern day slavery, which takes many different forms: forced labour, sex slavery, trading in organs, adoption and begging, for example.\nThat is why I am pleased that we are debating this important issue this evening. I would like to take the opportunity to thank you for your good cooperation to date and I hope that together, we will ultimately be able to arrive at a common resolution. I also hope that the new Commission will present a directive on trafficking in human beings as soon as possible - a directive that is more forceful and goes even further than the proposal made by the old Commission, which was, in itself, a good one.\nIn order to tackle the problem of human trafficking we need to have an overall perspective that takes into consideration all the affected policies; that is, not just penal", "Climate change and developing countries in the framework of the UN Conference on Climate Change in Copenhagen (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on climate change and developing countries in the framework of the UN Conference on Climate Change in Copenhagen.\nAndreas Carlgren\nMr President, we are at a decisive point in time. In just under two months' time, the world will sign an agreement in Copenhagen for combating the climate challenges that we face. This agreement must meet three conditions: it must keep global warming to less than two degrees Celsius, it must encompass all nations and it must adapt future efforts to higher levels of ambition as new knowledge becomes available.\nWith just 48 days left to the opening of the UN's major Conference on Climate Change, it is high time that political will was transformed into concrete actions. Negotiations are moving too slowly, however. A number of key issues have not yet been resolved. Many people are now taking the easy way out - by giving in to pessimism.\nLet me make one thing clear: that is not what the EU is here to do.\nWe want the EU to show leadership by expressing a clear, unequivocal political will. A comprehensive and ambitious agreement on climate change has the very highest priority for the Swedish Presidency.\nThe EU's response to the negotiating difficulties is that we must step up the pace. We must drive things forward to ensure that the world reaches the agreement required. We will take on the challenge of bringing the other nations of the world with us into an agreement that is sufficiently capable of meeting the challenge of climate change. We are therefore taking an intensive two-track approach: firstly, sending a powerful message to our negotiating partners; and secondly, bringing the EU together behind a strong negotiating mandate ahead of the Copenhagen conference. The EU has already laid the foundation for this with the climate and energy package ag", "Explanations of vote\nPresident\nWe now come to the explanations of vote.\nOral explanations of vote\nJens Rohde\n(DA) Madam President, we have today achieved an historic compromise with this directive on patient's rights. I believe this is the most historic agreement that we have concluded since I have been in Parliament. A historic compromise that has been cemented between two parties that have been a great distance apart for far too long, namely Parliament, on the one hand, and the Council, on the other. Through hard work, we have now succeeded in securing a compromise that will benefit patients, who will be protected against unreasonably long waiting times, and, at the same time, we have found a balance that will ensure that the Member States will be able to monitor what is happening from both a medical and a financial point of view.\nThe result that we have achieved here today is an extremely good one that will benefit patients and the Member States. I believe there is reason firstly to congratulate the negotiators, and then, of course, most importantly, to congratulate the European citizens on this result that has been voted through here today.\nClemente Mastella\n(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, up to now, there has been too much doubt and uncertainty surrounding access to treatment and reimbursement for cross-border healthcare. The directive we have approved today will finally enable all patients to enjoy a series of rights and healthcare services throughout Europe.\nThe aim is absolutely not to encourage cross-border healthcare as such, but to ensure its availability, safety and quality when it is of use or necessary. We need better information and more clarity regarding the legal rules applicable to healthcare given in a Member State other than the Member State of affiliation.\nThe current situation is unsatisfactory. The directive will offer patients an important choice which is based on their needs, not their means, and which is informed, not made under", "Report of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the report of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia.\nVytautas Landsbergis\nMadam President, on a point of order, I wish to protest against manipulation by somebody in the secretariat. A list was provided for the debate on the fact-finding mission to Georgia, but names of certain speakers, including mine, have been deleted. I therefore request my speaking time in accordance with what had been arranged until the last minute. I request the floor after Mr Kasoulides.\nPresident\nMr Landsbergis, it appears that there are only speakers on behalf of the groups, and you already have a speaker on behalf of the PPE Group. However, what I can offer you is to take you under the catch-the-eye procedure.\nLeonard Orban\nMember of the Commission. - (RO) I am pleased to have the opportunity today to discuss Georgia with you. Less than one year after the armed conflict with Russia, Georgia is facing numerous challenges which are of direct interest to the European Union, and we must give this country our undivided attention.\nThe report from the Independent International Fact-finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia, overseen by the Swiss ambassador, Heidi Tagliavini, was compiled at the European Union's request based on the Council's decision. However, it is totally independent and the European Union has not been involved at all in the process of drafting it, nor had anything to do with its content. Consequently, I will not go into detail on its results.\nWe believe that the report has achieved its main aim, which was to provide explanations for the events which took place in August 2008, as well as for the main causes of the conflict. The report clearly highlights, as often happens in conflict situations, that no single party is to blame for the conflict. Both Georgia and Russia are criticised for", "Results of the European Council (Brussels, 13-14 March 2008) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the European Council report and Commission statement - Results of the European Council (Brussels, 13-14 March 2008).\nJanez Jan\u0161a\nPresident-in-Office. - (SL) Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen. The March part-session of the European Council started with an address by the President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert P\u00f6ttering, whose speech gave us a good foundation for debate and decision-making on the major topics. There were three of these: continuation of economic growth and the creation of new jobs, response to climate change, and stabilisation of financial markets.\nThree decisions of the part-session summarise its achievements. We launched an ambitious and more modern three-year cycle of the Lisbon Strategy, which offers a better balance between care for people and the environment on the one hand and the competitive, knowledge-based market economy on the other. Secondly, we confirmed the basic principles and schedule for adoption of the energy and climate change package. Thirdly, we defined further measures to stabilise the financial markets.\nThe new cycle of the Lisbon Strategy primarily emphasises implementation of the reforms. Lately we have often witnessed some erroneous perceptions that the reason for the rise in retail prices and unstable financial markets is that the European Union has a weak economic foundation. The truth is precisely the opposite: it is the relatively firm foundation of the European economy that explains why the uncertainties in the global financial market and the price of crude oil and other commodities have had fewer consequences for the European Union than would have been the case had the economic foundation of the European Union been weak.\nLet us glance at some of the economic indicators. The European Union's public finance deficit has fallen by more than half since 2005. Public debt has gone", "Granting and withdrawing international protection (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Guillaume, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing international protection (recast) - C7-0248/2009 -.\nSylvie Guillaume\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first stage will be reached this week in the recasting of the Asylum Procedures Directive. Indeed, our Parliament will be required on Wednesday to give its verdict on the revised Commission proposal on common procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status.\nThis European Parliament opinion is essential to the dialogue that will be pursued with the Council in the coming months on a text that I believe is the cornerstone of the asylum package and on which - I am sorry to say - discussions are at a standstill in the Council. It will serve as a basis for a new version of this directive, which I hope will enable us to stick to our 2012 deadline for implementing common asylum rules.\nThe vote on this report coincides with the publication, last week, of a UNHCR study on the 44 industrialised nations. The study shows that, contrary to popular belief, the number of asylum seekers in rich countries has decreased overall by 40% in 10 years and by 5% in one year. Armed with such data, we need to study the root causes of this decline. Is it because of fewer push factors, or tighter migration control in some countries?\nWhat that report also shows is that developing countries today assume the lion's share of the responsibility for asylum, even though they do not necessarily have all the resources to do so. Europe must therefore do its fair share, and for that it must adopt clear rules. This brings me back to this text on asylum procedures and to the main challenges. Often described as a catalogue of the worst national practice", "2. Human Rights violations in China, notably the case of Liu Xiaobo\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on seven motions for resolution concerning violations of human rights in China, notably the case of Liu Xiaobo.\nRenate Weber\nauthor. - Mr President, last month, Mr Liu Xiaobo, the very well-known writer and political activist, was sentenced to 11 years' imprisonment for 'incitement to subvert state power'. He was arrested over a year ago after drafting Charter 08, a charter which was signed by more than 10 000 ordinary Chinese citizens, demanding the most normal things in a democratic society: the right to free speech, open elections and rule of law.\nThe prosecution of Mr Liu Xiaobo, based solely on his peaceful initiatives, and the judicial harassment he faced are undoubtedly incompatible with internationally acknowledged norms of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Therefore, we should call strongly for Mr Liu Xiaobo's unconditional release, which should take place immediately.\nIn the last few years, relations between the European Union and China have focused mainly on the economic dimension, which has overshadowed the country's democratic record and the gross human rights violations which have systematically occurred in China.\nA few days ago, for the first time, a police official admitted that the famous human rights lawyer and 2008 Nobel Peace Prize nominee, Mr Gao Zhisheng, had gone missing after a year in the Chinese authorities' custody. Many people fear that he might be dead. A few weeks ago, the Chinese Government disregarded an EU appeal not to execute a British citizen.\nIt is particularly disturbing to see how the Chinese Government ignores its international commitments in the field of human rights. One is entitled to wonder why, under these circumstances, China submitted its candidacy to the UN Human Rights Council - was it simply to legitimise the way it suppresses human rights?\nIn April 2009, the Chinese Government issued a national human rights", "Statements by the President\nPresident\nTo begin with, I would like to give you some information. Firstly, the Sixth International Day Against Homophobia is being observed in the European Union, today. Exactly 20 years ago, the World Health Organisation removed homosexuality from the International Classification of Diseases. The European Union is fighting discrimination on all fronts. This also includes homophobia. The obligation to protect the discriminated is embodied in our most important legal acts - in the treaty and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is referred to in the treaty.\nSecondly, this month, we celebrated the 60th anniversary of the Schuman Declaration, and on 8 and 9 May, our Parliament held Open Days in Brussels and Strasbourg. Visitors were able to see the work of Parliament close up and learn about our everyday work. The buildings were open to all citizens. In all, over 33 000 citizens of the European Union visited Parliament in Brussels and Strasbourg. We also had a meeting in this Chamber with 800 young people from all the countries of the European Union. There were 11 Members of the European Parliament with me. We talked with them, we sat together and discussed matters related to the Union.\nThe third piece of information. Last week, on Tuesday 11 May, I had the great honour to present the Charlemagne Youth Prize in Aachen. First prize was won by the 'Train for Europe' project from Germany. Second place was won by a project from Ireland and third place by a project from Bulgaria. Young people from all countries of the Union entered the competition. The German project brought together representatives from 21 European countries, and 24 vocational schools worked together to design and build a train. The main Charlemagne Prize was presented on 13 May two days after the Youth Prize, also in Aachen, to the Prime Minister of Poland, Donald Tusk.\nFourthly, last week, I took part in the Conference of Speakers of the European Union Parliaments in ", "Voting time\nPresident\nThe next item is voting time.\n(For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)\nJean-Pierre Audy\n(FR) Mr President, I should like to intervene under Rules 146 and 148 of our Rules of Procedure, on the subject of multilingualism and the deterioration of multilingualism within the European Parliament.\nI am taking advantage of the fact that the resolution on the work programme of the European Commission, plus Amendments 19 to 28 have not, at 12.40, been translated into French to draw your attention to the unacceptable deterioration of multilingualism in the European Parliament.\n(Applause)\nPresident\nThank you. We will bear this in mind in future and pay attention to such matters. This is something which is very important.\n", "Debate on the future of Europe (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the future of Europe, in which we are joined by the Prime Minister of the Netherlands and Member of the European Council, Mr Jan Peter Balkenende, whom I welcome most warmly to this House.\n(Applause)\nMr Balkenende, it is a great pleasure for me to be able to welcome you, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, to the European Parliament today in order to discuss the future of the European Union.\nPrime Minister, Mr Balkenende, the Kingdom of the Netherlands was not only among the founding members of the European Union, but also, in the course of the past 50 years, played a leading role on repeated occasions, on which it showed a great deal of determination, among those who themselves sought - and supported others who tried - to drive forward the history of our continent and make it an incomparable success story. Significant treaties and agreements within the European Union bear the names of cities in the Netherlands; there is the Treaty of Maastricht, whereby the European Union was founded, and the Treaty of Amsterdam, which accorded this House extensive rights of codecision.\nIt was, then, all the more a painful experience for us when the citizens of the Netherlands, in a referendum, rejected the draft constitution that contained such significant answers to the questions about Europe's future. However, like my fellow Members of this Parliament, and like you, Prime Minister, I am persuaded that the citizens of the Netherlands were not, by this decision, saying 'no' to the European Union itself, or to its worth or to its values.\nThis European Parliament very much values your willingness, Prime Minister, to participate in today's debate, above all in view of the fact that now, the cooperation of all 27 Member States is needed to put in place a renewed basis for the European Union, one that will stand the tests that the future will bring. The German Presidency of the Council, and the Federal", "Review of the consumer acquis (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Patrie, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the Green Paper on the Review of the Consumer Acquis.\nB\u00e9atrice Patrie  \nrapporteur. - (FR) Madam Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Commissioner Kuneva for our productive exchanges.\nWhy do we have this Green Paper and EP report? Three factors justify this exercise aimed at making the European consumer acquis, i.e. eight Directives adopted between 1985 and 1999, more consistent and more modern.\nFirst of all, the rapid development of new marketing techniques, primarily e-commerce, has rendered some of the European laws obsolete.\nSecondly, there are many inconsistencies in the current acquis, which contains different legal definitions of identical concepts.\nThirdly, the decision made in the past to opt for minimum harmonisation, thereby allowing the Member States to retain specific national provisions, has resulted in fragmentation of the legal environment, given that the rules in force lay down a minimum European standard but do not define a single method for meeting it. The consequence of this, according to the September 2006 Eurobarometer, is that 50% of citizens are more wary of cross-border purchases while 71% believe that it is more difficult to assert their rights when buying from sellers based in another Member State.\nSimilarly, it is important for economic operators in that they will benefit from a secure regulatory environment and will be able to make the most of an internal market comprising nearly 500 million consumers. One of the challenges of this review is enter a qualitative stage, to some extent laying the foundations for a European consumer code. However, what method should be used? The European Parliament fully supports the methodology proposed by the Commission, namely a mixed or combined approach: on the one hand, it is based on the", "Order of business\nPresident\nThe final draft agenda drawn up on Thursday, 1 July 2010 by the Conference of Presidents pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed. The following amendments have been proposed:\nMonday\nThe Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have made a request to hold over until a subsequent part-session the debate on Mrs Gallo's report on the enforcement of intellectual property rights in the internal market.\nI would now like to ask Mr Cohn-Bendit to speak on this.\nDaniel Cohn-Bendit\nMr President, we have already discussed this issue at the Conference of Presidents. Many groups are divided over Mrs Gallo's report and it seems that all the groups need to discuss the matter further, as there are problems and contradictory points which the groups have yet to resolve. That is why we have requested that the debate on and the vote on Mrs Gallo's report be postponed until September, the second September session or a later session. The issue will need to be examined at the Conference of Presidents. The solution is, therefore, quite simple. Given that the fruit is not yet ripe, let us leave it on the vine and discuss the matter again in September.\nMartin Schulz\nMr President, I would like to express my group's support for Mr Cohn-Bendit's motion. Our view of the situation is exactly the same. This is a highly sensitive and very delicate subject and it certainly makes sense for it to have a broad parliamentary majority. Therefore, it would be a good idea to postpone the report and to attempt to reach a consensus in various areas where this is still possible. This is why we are supporting this motion.\nManfred Weber\nMr President, different types of fruit take differing amounts of time to ripen. I can say on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) that our fruit is ripe for decision making and, therefore, we", "State aid to facilitate the closure of uncompetitive coal mines (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Bernhard Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on State aid to facilitate the closure of uncompetitive coal mines - C7-0296/2010 - 2010 /0220(NLE)) (\u03917-0324/2010).\nBernhard Rapkay\nMadam President, Mr Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to congratulate you, Mr Almunia, and your offices. The impact assessment that you have presented is very good. It is based on facts, it is conclusive and it gets to the point.\nIt is a pity that the other members of the College of Commissioners have not read this impact assessment, because if they had read it, they would not have been able to present this proposal, which has nothing at all to do with the impact assessment. I wonder how the College of Commissioners picked the year, for example. There is absolutely no mention of this in the impact assessment. The only thing which might explain it is that 2014 is exactly halfway between 2010 and 2018. That is what it must be.\nHowever, it may be that they have also not understood the content. None of the arguments in favour of this proposal can be seriously considered because they are not correct. There is the argument that the State aid scheme adopted in 2002, which is about to expire, was a phasing out arrangement for coal mining. Of course, this is totally incorrect. It was a successor arrangement. I know this, because I was there and I was the rapporteur for Parliament in 2002. This is when the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) expired after 50 years and a successor arrangement was needed, not only with regard to aid, but also other issues.\nIf this had been a phasing out arrangement, what would have happened, for example, to the ECSC's assets? It was not a phasing out arrangement, it was a successor arrangement. At the time, we agreed with good reason on a period of eight years for this succe", "Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting\nPresident\n The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\nThe President wishes to communicate that the Bureau has a comment. The Spanish version of the Folias resolution on granting discharge for the other institutions has not been corrected, as was requested during voting time. The services will therefore now correct the text of paragraph 19 of the resolution to bring it into line with the original Greek text.\n(The Minutes were approved)\n\nAnimal feedingstuffs/Vegetable proteins\nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following reports:\nRecommendation for second reading (A5-0079/2001), on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 79/373/EEC on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs and repealing Commission Directive 91/357/EEC [13292/1/2000 - C5-0002/2001 - 2000/0015(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf) and\nCommission statement on incentives for vegetable protein production.\nMr Graefe zu Baringdorf has the floor.\n\nGraefe zu Baringdorf\nMr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, this is a lesson in political evolution. An open declaration - I do not need to go into the details - means in the eyes of Parliament that the contents of the declaration must be laid out clearly and unambiguously on the table, so to speak. In 1979 it was turned into a disguised declaration and, since that time, the argument has run and run. It is running in Member States and has long been running here in Parliament and in the Commission.\nRight up to the time the Commission presented its proposal, the Commission services tried to make it clear to us that this was an open declaration. This assessment was finally reaffirmed in its own proposal. Parliament then approved this fine proposal after making a few", "2006 discharge (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on\nthe report by Dan J\u00f8rgensen on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control on discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2006, section III - Commission\n(SEC(2007)1056 - C6 0390/2007 - (SEC(2007)1055 - C6 0362/2007 -,\nthe report by Jos\u00e9 Javier Pom\u00e9s Ruiz on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control on discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2006, section I - European Parliament (C6-0363/2007 -,\nthe report by Nils Lundgren on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control on discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2006, section II - Council (C6-0364/2007 -,\nthe report by Nils Lundgren on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control on discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2006, section IV - Court of Justice (C6-0365/2007 -,\nthe report by Nils Lundgren on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control on discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2006, section V - Court of Auditors (C6-0366/2007 -,\nthe report by Nils Lundgren on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control on discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2006, section VI - European Economic and Social Committee (C6-0367/2007 -,\nthe report by Nils Lundgren on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control on discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2006, section VII - Committee of the Regions (C6-0368/2007 -,\nthe report by Nils Lundgren on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control on discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2006, section VIII - Euro", "1. 2007 discharge: EU general budget - Council (\nBefore the vote:\nNicole Sinclaire\nMr President, I rise under Rule 173, regarding Rule 2 of the Rules of Procedure.

That was the reality of Mr Farage's speech.\n(Applause)\nS\u00f8ren Bo S\u00f8ndergaard\nrapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to request a roll-call vote on the discharge of the Council's budget 2007.

This article is binding on all the institutions of the Union and on all its policies.\nYet, today, you have not carried out an impact assessment on the 'economic governance package' on which you are asking me to deliberate. These impact assessments are very close to the heart of the Commission when, for example, it comes to implementing legislation on electromagnetic diseases.\nThis is to be welcomed, but we would like the same zeal to be applied to economic governance. Otherwise, what do we see? We see Commissioner Rehn explaining to us today that there would be three pillars in his strategy: growth on the one hand, economic governance on the other, and, finally, supervision of the financial markets. But if the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing, the action of the Europe", "8. 2008 discharge: EU general budget, Council (\nRyszard Czarnecki\nJust one thing - we are giving the Council our trust on credit, but this credit is not without conditions. I am sure that cooperation with the Council over the next year will be much better and much more effective than before.\nJean-Pierre Audy\n(FR) Mr President, we are voting on the resolution on discharge, and Parliament recalls that we voted on discharge during the previous session. Unfortunately, one heading remained in the report. I will read it to you: 'Reasons for postponement of the discharge decision'. I propose that we table an oral amendment to remove this heading as well as the following heading: 'Further actions to be taken and documents to be presented to Parliament'. I think that this error is due to carelessness.\nPresident\nThank you. I think that your amendment is correct, and it is one that we would, in any case, have automatically made in order to bring the approval in line with today's date. I therefore agree with your recommendation.\n", "1. Transportation and illegal detention of prisoners (vote) \n- Before the vote\nGiovanni Claudio Fava \nrapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, I should just like to inform the services that, due to an inconsistency with the report voted on in committee, points 114, 127 and 128 must be brought into line with the rest of the equivalent paragraphs. Therefore, if Amendment 228 is adopted, Amendments 234 and 235 must also be adopted.\nIgnasi Guardans Camb\u00f3\n(FR) I quite understand that the House has decided to vote on the whole package of amendments. However, can someone explain to me what my group should do, in the case of a collective vote, to endorse some of the amendments and not to endorse others, or even to reject them? What must we do in that case, Mr President? Because, in the case in point, we want to endorse some of the amendments and vote against others. What do you propose, Mr President?\nPresident\nThat is why the groups were asked in due course to submit requests for separate votes, which the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, in particular, did do. The amendments that caused the most problems and on which the groups wanted to vote more precisely will thus be withdrawn from the collective vote and will be submitted to you a little later on.\nIf your group has not requested separate votes on certain packages of amendments, that means, in principle, that they do not pose any problems. I do not want to re-open the debate on this subject.\n(Mr Guardans Camb\u00f3 insisted)\nEveryone understood your position, and I hope that I have given you the most neutral technical explanation possible. You do not have the floor, Mr Guardans Camb\u00f3; you have already spoken twice.\n(Mr Guardans Camb\u00f3 continued to insist)\nIf you wish to request an additional separate vote, specify which one, and I will incorporate it.\nIgnasi Guardans Camb\u00f3\nI would like a separate vote on Amendment 38.\n- Before the vote on paragraph 60\nGiovanni Claudio Fava \nrapporteur.", "Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Brepoels on behalf of Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee establishing\nan Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) (PE-CONS 3685/2006 - -.\nFrieda Brepoels \nrapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, finally, we are about to reap the rewards of more than two and a half years of sustained commitment by a huge number of people, both in the Commission and in Parliament, who firmly believe in the added value of the INSPIRE Directive for environmental policy in the European Union. I know for a fact that this is not the sexiest issue we have ever discussed here, and given the highly technical content, everyone assumed that an agreement at first reading was on the cards. This was, however, overlooking the fact that some Member States were dead set against any form of harmonisation of spatial environmental information, and that were, above all, also concerned about compensation and licences and saw this initiative as a threat to national monopolies. No fewer than five Council presidencies had INSPIRE listed as a priority, but it was the Finnish Presidency that managed, during the night of 21 November 2006, to persuade the Member States to end their resistance. I should also like to take this opportunity of warmly thanking everyone who has done their bit to achieve this success, not least the Commissioner and his staff. They have done much of the groundwork, in tandem with an international team of experts that has responded with particular enthusiasm, as a result of which no time has been lost. I should also like to make a point of thanking the shadow rapporteurs and their staff, Parliament's Legal Office, the Secretariat of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the conciliation secretariat, the Council presidency and all their staff.\nHaving ", "3. New Flame shipwreck (vote) \n- Before the vote:\nZbigniew Zaleski\nMadam President, with regard to your comments on announcing the results of roll-call votes, allow me to express my gratitude to all those who chair votes in this House.

Thank you very much for agreeing to see how smoothly it goes.\n- Before the vote on Amendment 6:\nGerardo Galeote\n(ES) Madam President, I agree with the author of the amendment and suggest that, where the text refers to the regional authorities of Andalucia, the words 'and local' should be added so that the phrase reads 'regional and local authorities of Andalucia'.\n(The oral amendment was accepted)\n", "\n\nPresident.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The next item is the oral question to the Council (B6-0238/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on financing TEN-T and the oral question to the Commission (B6-0239/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on financing TEN-T. \nPaolo Costa (ALDE ),\n\u00a0\u00a0 . Mr\u00a0President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Transport and Tourism, which I have the honour of chairing, is following the process of achieving a trans-European transport network (TEN-T), as set out in the guidelines codecided by the Council and Parliament in April 2004, with much attention and with some concern.\nThe concerns stem from the discovery of significant delays in the execution of constituent projects of the first definition of the TEN-T \u2013 codecided in 1996 \u2013 and from the identification of insufficient funding as the principal cause of those delays. Decision No 884/2004, which amended the definition of the TEN-T in the Union of 25, anticipates large-scale financial requirements: at least EUR 225 billion for the 30 projects from now until 2020, of which at least EUR 140 billion is to be spent in the period incorporated within the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective.\nGiven the strategic value of creating the trans-European network, it would appear crucial that funding for these requirements should be guaranteed straight away, if possible even prior to the definition of the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective, in order to prevent unbearable frustrations for the Union and Member States in coming years.\nIt is strategic for the internal and external competitiveness of the economy of a Union that must fully exploit the benefits of the single market. Such benefits will be illusory if a product manufactured in Lisbon or Dublin cannot compete with similar products manufactured in Warsaw or Budapest because of differentials in transport costs. It is strategic for the sustainability of European transport, since the priority projects chiefl", "New EU action plan for Afghanistan and Pakistan (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on the new EU action plan for Afghanistan and Pakistan.\nCecilia Malmstr\u00f6m\nMadam President, the problems facing Afghanistan and Pakistan are naturally a concern of the whole world. Violent extremism is spreading beyond the region. Drugs that are grown and produced in Afghanistan find their way onto the streets of Europe. One of the driving forces behind our commitment is the need to prevent Afghanistan and Pakistan becoming safe havens for terrorist activity and organised crime. At the same time, of course, we want to help create better countries for the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan to live in.\nA lot of attention is focused on Afghanistan. Many of our countries have troops and significant numbers of civil personnel in the country. Turning around the situation in Afghanistan represents a major challenge. Pakistan, too, faces serious challenges. There will be no solution to the conflict in Afghanistan if we do not also get to grips with the situation in Pakistan, and vice versa.\nAn overall initiative is required. We all need to do more and to do better. In June, the Council asked the Council Secretariat and the Commission to put forward specific recommendations and political priorities to strengthen and enhance our commitment in the region. The result was the EU action plan for strengthening the EU's involvement in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This was adopted in October. I believe that this action plan is a good tool. The basic strategy is already in place. The action plan will allow us to adapt the instruments currently being used to meet our political priorities.\nThe plan is based on our current commitment and lays down a number of priorities. These are the areas in which we believe EU measures can be most effective. In so doing, we are strengthening our commitment and presenting a united response to the challenges faced by Afghanistan and Pa", "7. Common organisation of the markets in fisheries and aquaculture (vote) \n- Report: Pedro Gueirrero\n- Before the vote:\nPedro Guerreiro\nrapporteur. - (PT) I should like to begin this short statement by welcoming the decision by the European Parliament Committee on Fisheries to produce a report on the Common Organisation of the Markets in fisheries and aquaculture products. It is known and recognised that this COM has still not realised the objectives for which it was created, namely to ensure stable markets for fisheries products and to secure a fair income for producers. That being so, we appreciate the European Commission's albeit tardy decision to undertake an in-depth evaluation of the existing COM and call on it to carry out its urgent revision in order to boost its contribution to guaranteeing incomes in the sector, ensuring market stability, improving the marketing of fisheries products and increasing the value-added generated, notably by a significant increase in financial resources.\nDespite the fact that some of our initial proposals did not obtain the necessary consensus in the Committee on Fisheries, we consider that the report now put to the vote contains valuable measures, such as measures to determine whether the existing intervention mechanisms are the most suitable ones and whether they are sufficiently flexible to meet the relevant needs in the various Member States; to introduce a compensatory payment for sardines like the one already existing for tuna; to meet the need for the Structural Funds to contribute to the modernisation and creation of support infrastructures for producers in the context of production/marketing; to provide genuine support for the creation and funding of producers' organisations and above all for small-scale coastal and traditional fisheries; to ensure the application to imported fisheries products sold on the internal market of the same rules and requirements as those applied to Community fisheries products. These are matt", "\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 6 April 2006. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 I would like to inform you that at its meeting of 6 April the Conference of Presidents accepted the request of the Delegation for Relations with Iran to change its name to the Delegation for Relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran.\nIf we accept this proposal, we are effectively amending one of Parliament\u2019s resolutions, the resolution giving names to the delegations for relations with third countries. What we therefore need is for nobody to oppose it. If nobody is opposed, the name of that delegation will be changed as I indicated. \nPaulo Casaca (PSE ).\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013 Mr President, I should like to express my total opposition to this about-turn, which amounts to a pathetic surrender to the demands of the new President of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. There is absolutely no justification for this act, which is totally out of step with Parliament's tradition. I therefore protest and wish to register my vehement objection to your decision. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Does anybody else wish to speak? Although really, one speaker is enough\u00a0\u2026\nGeorgios Karatzaferis (IND/DEM ).\n\u00a0\u00a0 Mr President, we must respect the principles of each country. Irrespective of whether this country is friendly, less friendly or more friendly, this country has decided on a name. We cannot but respect the name of this country. The rest \u2013 as I think everyone understands \u2013 is not democratic; it is blatant intervention in the internal affairs of a country. We have to respect whatever this country wishes to call itself. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 We are not going to open up the debate now, since it would go on forever and it has already been held in the proper place; it is now simply a case of accepting or rejecting the proposal of the Conference of Presidents.\nSince opposition has been expressed, we shall vote on it, but not now: the Members need to be made aware that a vote is to take place.

Democratic Republic of Congo: the case of Floribert Chebeya Bahizire\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the Democratic Republic of Congo: the case of Floribert Chebeya Bahizire.\nIsabelle Durant\nauthor. - (FR) Mr President, on the eve of the celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of the independence of the Democratic Republic of Congo, we thought it was important for the European Parliament to give its opinion on the murder of Mr Chebeya Bahizire.\nMr Chebeya Bahizire was a human rights defender and the director of the NGO 'Voice of the Voiceless'. He was a famous Congolese activist. He was found dead in his car in a suburb of Kinshasa on 2 June this year, and his driver, Fid\u00e8le Bazana, has not been located or found since.\nMy questions are: why was he killed? Who killed him? I think that, as is emphasised in the resolution, an independent, credible, thorough and transparent committee of inquiry should be set up to establish the truth about the death of Mr Chebeya Bahizire and to shed light on the disappearance of his driver.\nWe are all aware that the general deterioration of the situation of human rights defenders in the Democratic Republic of Congo is particularly worrying. Cases involving many human rights defenders, including Pascal Kabungulu Kibembi in 2005, and several journalists, have still not been solved. Investigations led by the Congolese military authorities have been characterised by serious irregularities.\nI therefore consider it essential to identify those responsible for these murders, to bring them to justice, in accordance with Congolese law and with international provisions on the protection of human rights, in order to put an end to the impunity. Punishing those responsible for murdering human rights defenders and journalists is an essential part of democracy. We said so again this morning, in Mrs Hautala's report. The resolution therefore calls on the European Union and on the Democratic Republic of Congo, as signatories to the Cotonou", "1. Security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents (\nAfter the vote on the report by Carlos Coelho\nFrancesco Enrico Speroni\n(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a point of order. You informed us that, at the request of the journalists, an estimable group, you would announce all the votes, but it seems to me that Parliament's rules ought to be made by parliamentarians, not journalists. I would like to know whether this is the association of blind journalists, because the journalists can very well see the outcome of the vote on the screens. In any case, deaf journalists may have some difficulty if you announce the results.\n(Applause)\nPresident\nMr Speroni, I have some difficulty in expressing my own personal opinion of the difficulties of journalists' work. Since this request has been made to the Bureau at this time, I think that a reply - and probably I personally share your views - a reply should be given by the Bureau; it has already been decided that the issue of the reply to be made will be on the agenda of the next Bureau meeting.\nEdward McMillan-Scott\nMr President, I agree with the position that Mr Speroni has put forward. I recognise the difficulty you are in, but I would suggest that he is right. The screens do record every vote. To read out every amendment result would be very time-consuming - especially with a vote like we have today. I would suggest that you ask the Bureau to remit it to the relevant committee, and we will consider it for a future voting session - if that is acceptable to the House.\n(Applause)\nPresident\nAs I have already said, the issue will be referred to the Bureau, precisely so that it can give a definitive answer.\nWe will therefore move on to the vote.\n", "7. Macro-prudential oversight of the financial system and establishment of a European Systemic Risk Board (\nBefore the final vote:\nSylvie Goulard\nMadam President, I have nothing to add to what my fellow Members have said.

I therefore hope that the Council will be able to take account of this fact when it sees how many States are also in agreement with us.\n(Applause)\n", "Restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Jill Evans, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (recast) - C6-0471/2008 -.\nJill Evans\nrapporteur. - Madam President, I would first of all like to thank all of my colleagues who have made this first reading agreement possible - in particular, of course, all of the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and both the Spanish and Belgian Presidencies, as well as the Environment Committee and the group staff and assistants. We managed to reach agreement following a lot of hard but constructive work, including some very difficult compromises.\nTo put this debate into its proper context, over 9 million tonnes of electrical and electronic equipment is sold every year in the European Union. Most of this is large household appliances and IT and telecommunication equipment. As this market continues to grow, it has also become the fastest-growing waste stream in the EU, estimated to rise to a huge 12.3 million tonnes by 2020. It is a very complex waste stream that includes several hazardous substances.\nThe waste hierarchy makes prevention of waste the first priority, which means substituting hazardous substances in products which prevent recycling or pose a risk to health and the environment when undergoing waste treatment. The Commission estimates that the current RoHS Directive has led to a reduction of 100 000 tonnes of certain heavy metals and two groups of brominated flame retardants from going into the waste stream and potentially entering the environment. RoHS has set a global standard, but there was a need for more clarity, so we had a great responsibility with this recast to ensure that a clearer and more ambitious", "8. Appointment of the executive director of the European Banking Authority (EBA) (\nSharon Bowles\nMr President, I will not keep you long. Today we are voting on the resolutions to approve the executive directors of the European supervisory authorities. Issues concerning the overall procedure for the future were dealt with last month in the negotiations surrounding the appointment of the Chairs of the authorities.\nFor the Banking Authority, the proposed executive director is Adam Farkas; for the Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority it is Carlos Montalvo, and for the Markets Authority it is Verena Ross. The nominees all attended confirmation hearings in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs last week. These were webstreamed, and are therefore available on the ECON website, as are the candidates' biographies. The full committee decided by a substantial majority that we should vote in favour of these candidates, so that is the recommendation from the committee.\n", "Announcement by the President\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, I should like to make an important announcement regarding this afternoon's vote. For technical reasons, the results of roll-call votes displayed and announced by the president of the sitting do not correspond exactly to the actual number recorded by the voting system. In no case has the result of a vote been affected, as the majorities have not changed.\nThat being the case, today's midday votes cannot be called into question and are deemed approved. The results that will be published as an annex to the minutes of today's sitting will be the actual results.\nIt is understood that the technical services are making every effort to determine the reason for this malfunction and that all functions will be restored for tomorrow's votes.\n", "5. The European Union's role in Iraq (\n- After the vote on Amendment 10\nAnna Z\u00e1borsk\u00e1\n(FR) Madam President, I should simply like to propose an oral amendment as follows: 'having regard to the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, together with Additional Protocols I and II thereto, and particularly concerned at the violence suffered by humanitarian, medical and religious personnel in the performance of their duties'. That is the text of the amendment. I have consulted widely with colleagues from the various groups and they have assured me that they will not obstruct my proposal.\n(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)\n", "Double-hull or equivalent design requirements for single-hull oil tankers (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Fernand Le Rachinel, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 417/2002 on the accelerated phasing-in of double-hull or equivalent design requirements for single-hull oil tankers and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 2978/94 C6-0104/2006.\nJacques Barrot\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to present to you today the amendment to the regulation on double-hull oil tankers. This proposal is designed to bring the regulation into line with the political statement made at the International Maritime Organisation in December 2003 by the Presidency of the European Union on behalf of the Member States and of the European Commission. This statement was extremely clear. It was designed to indicate to all the parties signatory to the MARPOL Convention that no EU Member State would authorise oil tankers flying its flag to make use of one of the exemptions laid down by the Convention, namely that relating to the use of single-hull vessels to carry oil.\nWith regard to the ban on carrying heavy grades of oil in single-hull vessels, the current regulation only applies to vessels entering waters under Community jurisdiction. This means that a Member State may in theory, and contrary to the public commitment of 2003, authorise the carriage of heavy grades of oil in single-hull oil tankers flying its flag - that is to say, one of the European flags - as long as these vessels are operating outside Community waters.\nThis situation, honourable Members, is unacceptable. It is easy to imagine the consequences, in a third country, of an oil slick caused by an oil tanker flying a Community flag, and this at a time when Europe, for its part, protects itself against such eventualities. I would add that almost all the Member States have alr", "2. Madagascar\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Madagascar.\nMikel Irujo Amezaga\nMadam President, as can be seen from the resolution itself, after two months of violent clashes, Andry Rajoelina, former mayor of the capital of Madagascar, staged a coup d'\u00e9tat on 17 March of this year; he was supported by the army and a self-proclaimed 'High Authority of Transition', over which he presides, and he suspended the national assembly and the senate. Furthermore, pressure from rebels forced the democratically elected president to leave Madagascar.\nHowever, last February Mr Rajoelina, who had been elected mayor of Antananarivo in December 2007, had, in turn, been forcibly removed from power by the previous government. I should add that the malaise felt by the population was exacerbated by the former government's plan to rent one million hectares of land in the south of the country to a Korean firm.\nOf course, we also condemn the coup d'\u00e9tat and any attempt to seize power by undemocratic means. We also believe that the United Nations Security Council and international organisations of which Madagascar is a member do not recognise this de facto regime and we want constitutional order to be restored. We ask, too, that legal and constitutional systems be immediately re-established in the country and we call on all Malagasy parties to fully comply with the provisions of the constitution of Madagascar in order to overcome this crisis.\nHowever, we also consider that democracy does not simply consist in holding elections and we should report major irregularities in the - a priori - legitimate government of Madagascar.\nNevertheless, we are convinced that when constitutional order is restored it should be based on the objectives and principles that already appear in Recital K of this resolution, that is: a clear timetable for free, fair and transparent elections; the participation of all political groups and social stakeholders in the country, incl", "Voting time\nPresident\nThe next item is the vote.\nI would like to inform the Chamber that during the vote, at the express request of the association of parliamentary journalists, for each set of results we must also expressly indicate the number of votes for and against and the number of abstentions.

Certain MEPs, who did not vote in favour of the conviction, should stop turning a blind eye, as what is happening in Italy, with respect to freedom, is a very serious matter. It affects and concerns all Europeans, whatever the outcome of the vote today.\nVilija Blinkevi\u010di\u016bt\n(LT) I voted for the resolution drafted by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats together with other groups, because freedom of information, freedom of expression and diversity of opinion must be ensured in all of the Member States of the European Union. Freedom of information is the foundation of a free democratic society and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, it is laid down that every person has the right to freedom of expression, and this right includes the right to have one's own convictions and to obtain and distribute information and ideas without the interference of government institutions. Therefore we, Members of the European Parliament, must support the development of independent media and fair competition at national level. In order to ensure effective freedom of the press, government institutions must be prepared to defend freedom of expression and to foster its development, which is the most important thing ensuring the fundamental values and rights of the European Union.\nCrescenzio Rivellini\n(IT) Mr President, 'what a caterpillar calls the end of the world, the entire world calls a butterfly'. That thought by a Chinese philosopher is of relevance in this debate, if we consider that President Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize despite attacking the hostile television coverage he received, and here we are discussing allegations of a lack of freedom that are motivated by one thing only: the culture of hatred against Mr Be", "Opening of the sitting\n(The sitting was opened at 9 a.m.)\n\u00b0\n\u00b0 \u00b0\nMonica Frassoni\n(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the ECURIE System - the European Community security system - was triggered yesterday following an undefined incident in a Slovenian nuclear power station. The alert was subsequently called off, but doubts persist as to the true nature of the incident and the reasons for this highly unusual alert. We therefore wish to make the most of the fact that the Commission will be present later on today, and that Slovenia holds the presidency, to call upon the presidency and the Commission to inform the European Parliament, and hence the public, of the real reasons why this utterly abnormal procedure occurred. I should be grateful, Madam President, if you would act on this request.\nPresident\nI think that the Slovenian Presidency, which will be here today, will come back to this request.\n", "\n(1) \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is the joint debate on:\n- The European Council report and Commission statement European Council (Brussels, 12 and 13 December 2003);\n- Council and Commission statements Meeting of Heads of State or Government on the IGC (Brussels, 12 and 13 December 2003);\n- Statement by the President-in-Office of the Council The work of the Italian presidency.\nI should like at the outset to profit from this moment to share with you a brief report of the summit meeting and the IGC from the perspective of those questions which I raised on behalf of this House so that before we go into our debate proper you will have been informed of what we had to say.\nI am bound to say that, as regards the work that was done at the European Council meeting, a very high volume of business was transacted in a short period of time and considerable progress made in quite a number of areas. Indeed it is worth placing on the record that we in this House enjoyed in those terms a very positive engagement with the Italian presidency in working across our committees on many different areas.\nIn particular and following the recent resolutions of the House I welcomed the conclusions on EU-transatlantic relations, but I made the point that it is precisely in a phase of deepening transatlantic relations, which is the objective of the conclusions, that our candid friendship with the United States should not exclude our candid concerns about Guantanamo Bay. I spoke on behalf of the House in those terms.\nWith regard to the Kyoto Protocol, I recalled that as we were meeting there was a UN-sponsored meeting in Milan. It seems that Russia still has an open mind on whether to sign the Kyoto Protocol. We Europeans have a strong interest that the Russians should do so and therefore make it effective. I believe the Commission and the incoming presidency should take clear initiatives to ensure that in the months to come we who believe in Kyoto should seek to bring it to a satisfactory defini", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nWijsenbeek\nMadam President, on page 6 of yesterday's Minutes it says that I asked to make a personal statement. What I said then, Madam President, was proven again by something that happened yesterday. On Dutch television, in the programme Nova , Mrs Van Dijk again did precisely what I reproached the Greens for yesterday, in other words, she misrepresented the situation for electoral purposes. She maintained on television that I am against any change in the current statutory arrangements for Members. Everyone in this House knows that I have said very clearly time after time, orally and in writing, and in reports by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, that I am of the opinion that the same statute must apply to all Members and that there must be no discrimination on grounds of nationality because that is against Article 6 of the Treaty. At the present time, Madam President, Italians in this House earn five times more than Spaniards. That is a disgrace! That is discrimination on grounds of nationality. We are deemed to perform the same work and should therefore receive the same emoluments. Once there is a statute based on equality, Madam President, the rules for travel and subsistence expenses can also be changed. I demand that the Greens withdraw their accusation that I am against change. I am in favour of it. Madam President, we expect proposals from the Bureau as soon as possible on a single statute.\nI have one final remark, Madam President. Why is there not a service in Brussels which can make reports of sittings available the next day, as in Strasbourg? It is an odd situation. No, those are the Minutes, Mr Martens. I am talking about the Verbatim Report, the so-called \"Rainbow' , in all the various languages. But Mr Martens, he is hardly here, he does not know all about it yet. Madam President, I hope that Brussels will be treated in the same ", "20. Revised Hungarian Constitution (\nWilliam\nMr President, this is a blatant attempt to interfere with a national parliament and should not be voted on by the European Parliament.\n(Applause)\n", "Review of the Belgian Presidency of the Council (debate) \nPresident\nColleagues, allow me to welcome Prime Minister Yves Leterme. Half a year ago, we had the presentation of the Belgian Presidency. Now we have the presentation of the achievements of the Belgian Presidency: legislation, the European External Action Service, financial supervision, the Citizens' Initiative, the budget - we will discuss all these points.\nWelcome, too, to President Barroso, who is present with us, and to all of you.\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements: Review of the Belgian Presidency of the Council.\nYves Leterme\nMr President, Mr Barroso, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, though this may appear somewhat incongruous here, in the plenary hall of the European Parliament, I would nonetheless like to start my speech with a quote from a great North American thinker, Ralph Waldo Emerson, who said, and I quote:\n'Do not go where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail'.\n(FR) In other words: 'Do not go where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail'.\nLadies and gentlemen, this is exactly what we have done, with you all, these last six months. Belgium, my country, was called upon to assume the rotating Presidency of the European Union after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.\nIt is true that we were not venturing into totally unknown territory but, even so, it was necessary to establish the criteria for the new functioning of the European Union under the new Treaty, with the new institutions with which the European Union has equipped itself. Therefore, true to the Belgian tradition, the tradition of my country, we did our utmost to enable the institutions to function optimally to create the right precedents.\nLadies and gentlemen, I feel able to say to you that the European Union, as it was structured under the Treaty of Lisbon, functions today and functions well. The Union has equipped itself with a new instr", "\n((1) \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is a report (A5-0035/2004) by Mr\u00a0Brie, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on Afghanistan: challenges and prospects for the future [2003/2121(INI)]. \nBrie (GUE/NGL ),\n\u00a0\u00a0 . \u2013 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if you have ever visited Afghanistan or endeavoured to become more deeply informed about it, you will know how appalling and how extensive is the damage that has been done there \u2013 materially, culturally, socially and in human terms. Civil wars, the power struggles of local warlords, the Soviet war of occupation, the Taliban dictatorship, and the Northern Alliance\u2019s bombardments too have killed and maimed millions, destroyed the economy of what was already an extremely poor country and left much of its society in ruins.\nFor centuries, Afghanistan was the plaything of foreign powers\u2019 strategic interests. In my view, the present situation is above all the consequence of the wars sparked off by the Soviet invasion, and of the USA\u2019s short-sighted policies, both of which gave the Taliban real military and political power in Afghanistan. The victims have always been Afghan women, children and men \u2013 in their millions.\nThis report, however, is not meant to be about our differences on the past \u2013 although we certainly have them \u2013 but about our common position that the international community must take responsibility for providing, on a massive scale, political, financial and economic support for the people of Afghanistan in shaping a peaceful, democratic and social future for themselves. This aid, and the financial support provided by the Commission in particular, must not be cut back; it must be stepped up to take account of the prevailing conditions. It would be irresponsible of the international community, in the shadow of the war in Iraq and of the tragic difficulties there, to backtrack on its commitment to Afghanistan and weaken its solidarity with its people. I belie", "Free movement of Roma within the EU borders (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the free movement of Roma within the EU borders.\nJoaqu\u00edn Almunia\nMember of the Commission. (ES) Two weeks ago saw the start of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All. Equal opportunities and the right to live without discrimination are among the key values on which the EU is based.\nThe Commission is well aware of the fact that the Roma are among the groups most at risk of discrimination and of being excluded from the labour market, from society, from involvement in drawing up policy and from cultural life.\nConsequently, the Commission has undertaken to use all the instruments at its disposal to address the issue of the exclusion of the Roma minority.\nI should like to mention two of these: firstly, the implementation of the 2000 Directive, which provides protection against discrimination on racial and ethnic grounds. The Commission wishes to ensure that this Directive be incorporated into the legislation and to be implemented properly in all Member States. Secondly, I wish to mention the use of financial instruments, specifically the Structural Funds and, most importantly, the European Social Fund.\nThe Commission has asked the Member States to incorporate the objective of including the Roma community when it draws up its operational plans for the financial perspective 2007-2013.\nMajor effort is required to increase awareness among the Roma and among the population as a whole of the right to live without discrimination and to enjoy the benefits of diversity. In this regard, the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All and the ongoing information campaign entitled 'For Diversity, Against Discrimination' are, in our view, extremely useful instruments.\nThe Commission welcomes the achievements made so far during the Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005-2015 in which nine governments from Central and Eastern Europe and the Western Balkans, including five EU M", "Deposit-guarantee schemes as regards the coverage level and the payout delay (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Ehler, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 94/19/EC on Deposit Guarantee Schemes as regards the coverage level and the payout delay - C6-0361/2008 -.\nChristian Ehler\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are closing a very fast process to reform the Deposit Guarantee Directive. The whole procedure demonstrates the capability but also the limitations of the European institutions. It was only in mid-October that the Commission tabled a proposal to amend the directive, which has both a political and an economic objective, namely to restore depositors' confidence in the financial market, the cross-border activities of banks and the regulation of the financial markets in general.\nWe have achieved an increase in the level of deposit guarantees, a clear reduction in payout deadlines in case of a crisis and the abolition of joint deposit guarantees. It was unacceptable that large banks were unable to foresee the demise of their own institution and for small depositors to go down with them. We have achieved an increase in the level of deposit guarantees from 2010 to EUR 100 000, which covers 90% of deposits in Europe.\nWe in the European Parliament played a quick and constructive role in the process. We waived numerous parliamentary rights, but we got things moving. We considered the three-day deadline to be unrealistic from the start. I think that 20 days is a promise that can be kept in practice and will not disappoint depositors.\nIt was important to re-incorporate small undertakings. In light of the systemic stabilisation of the financial markets, it would have been a fatal signal to only guarantee private deposits. We also saw - and this is particularly important - the need for emergency payouts, becaus", "17. Mexico Strategic Partnership (\n\nPresident\nBefore the last vote, which is always unruly, I would like to say something. This is the last plenary sitting in which our Secretary-General, Harald R\u00f8mer, will participate. I expressed the thanks of the European Parliament at length on your behalf at the reception two days ago. I would also like to do that here in plenary by way of conclusion: thank you very much Harald R\u00f8mer for your service to the European Parliament, which spans several decades.\n(Loud applause)\n(Protests)\nAnyone who has worked for the European Parliament for 36 years deserves well of the European Parliament.

Enlargement Strategy and Main Challenges 2006-2007 (vote) \n- Before the vote on Amendment 29:\nElmar Brok \nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, I propose that we should adopt Amendment 29, but also incorporate an element from the original text, so that it would end up - as an addition to the Socialist amendment - reading: 'which make up the European identity' as a combination of both drafts.\n(The oral amendment was adopted)\n- Before the vote on Amendment 16:\nElmar Brok \nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, we have to adapt our text to take account of the latest developments in the negotiations on Turkey. We have tried to take the Socialist Group's Amendment 16 as a basis for this, and have put it into a form corresponding to the facts of the situation since Monday's Council of Foreign Ministers. Although you have the amendment in printed form, I can read it out if you wish. The rapporteur and the author of the amendment are agreed on this.\n(The oral amendment was adopted)\n- Before the vote on Amendment 17:\nGiorgos Dimitrakopoulos\n(EL) Mr President, in Amendment 17 tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I wish to change the term ' Northern Cyprus' to the term 'Turkish Cypriot Community'. I discussed this with Mr Swoboda this morning and, as far as I understood, he accepts it.\n(The oral amendment was adopted)\nJoost Lagendijk\nMr President, this is not an objection to Mr Dimitrakopoulos' proposal, but I would like to add some other words to the same oral amendment. After this morning's debate, and after the Council last Monday expressed its support for the renewed UN efforts to solve the Cyprus problem, I would like to add the following words to the oral amendment made by Mr Dimitrakopoulos: 'in close cooperation with renewed UN efforts'.\n(Applause)\n(The oral amendment was adopted)\n", "Impact assessment of the compromises reached in the Doha negotiations on NAMA and services at the end of July 2008 (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the impact assessment of the compromises reached in the Doha negotiations on NAMA and services at the end of July 2008.\nCatherine Ashton\nMember of the Commission. - Madam President, we are facing the greatest economic challenge for a generation, and in that challenge both developed and developing countries face difficult and very important decisions.\nWe need a positive effect from globalisation to respond to the negative effects of globalisation. It is my strong belief that, wherever we begin to look at what we need to do, we will end in the conclusion that completing the multilateral trade round - the Doha Round - is of vital importance to us.\nI probably do not need to remind honourable Members of what history teaches us about protectionism, the importance of keeping our markets open and the possibility for our businesses to be able to trade across the world. I probably do not need to tell all honourable Members that, simply within the rules of the World Trade Organisation, if countries moved from applying their tariffs the way that they do at the present time to applying them in the way they are allowed to do under the rules, then the cost to trade would be something of the order of EUR 260 billion. I am sure I do not need to remind honourable Members that, as the developing nations consider the future, they are deeply concerned about what will happen to some of the aid that has been available to them so far.\nSo, in terms of where we are: we know the value of a deal that is now 80% complete and that in July 2008 80% of what needed to be done was done. Within that agreement, the value is of the following order: the gains in the developing countries would be of the order of EUR 12-14 billion annually; there would be new access to emerging markets in emerging countries, such as China; we wo", "3. (\n- Before the vote on Amendment 3:\nLydie Polfer\nrapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I just wanted to ask Mr Tannock if the addition he is proposing is in fact an addition, or whether his aim is to remove the section on violence and ill-treatment in police custody and penitentiary institutions. If his amendment is to be an addition, I can of course support it. If, however, he wishes part of the existing text to be deleted, I can only recommend that we vote against it.\nCharles Tannock\n(FR) It is an addition. Thank you.\n- Before the vote on Amendment 7:\nLydie Polfer\nrapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, in paragraph 32 we repeat the two conditions, i.e. territorial integrity and self-determination, even though they are already mentioned in paragraph 30. However, the author of the amendment has added 'self-determination of the people who live there'. I strongly recommend that we delete the words 'of the people who live there' because that would exclude the refugees and persons displaced in their own country. Therefore, if the author of the amendment agrees to delete those few words, I will be able to support the amendment; otherwise, I recommend that we reject it.\nCharles Tannock\nMr President, I have agreed to that change to the oral amendment.\n(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)\n- Before the vote on Amendment 8/rev:\nCharles Tannock\nMr President, as we agreed at the beginning of the session, it will be an addition now. In the actual text it says to replace the words 'in the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum gas pipeline' with the words 'in the trans-Caspian energy corridor projects'. But by negotiation at the beginning of the voting session, I have already agreed this should be an addition rather than a replacement, so can we include the words 'in the trans-Caspian energy corridor projects'.\n(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)\n", "Composition of Parliament\nPresident\nThe Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has informed me that with effect from today Mr Severin is no longer a member of the group. This time it is an official notification. In accordance with Rule 211(3), the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has proposed the following interpretation of Rule 128 entitled 'Proceedings before the Court of Justice of the European Union'. The whole interpretation has been made available for your inspection. The above interpretation will be considered adopted if no objections are lodged by the opening of the sitting on Thursday, 24 March 2011. So you have until tomorrow at 9.00 to lodge objections to this interpretation. It is a long one, so I am not going to read it out. Nevertheless, all of you do have access to this interpretation.\nI would also like to inform you officially that Mr Thaler has resigned from Parliament with effect from 21 March 2011. In accordance with Rule 4(1) and (3), Parliament has noted the resignation and established the vacancy from the date I have just given. Mrs Soullie has resigned from Parliament with effect from 24 March 2011. In accordance with Rule 4(1) and (3), Parliament has noted the resignation and established the vacancy from the date I have just given. In addition, the competent authorities of France have informed me that Mrs Soullie will be replaced by Mr Hortefeux with effect from 24 March 2011. I understand Mr Hortefeux is with us today. Are you in the Chamber, Mr Hortefeux? We do not see him - he is not here.\nUnder Rule 3(2), until such time as his credentials have been validated or a ruling has been given on any dispute, Mr Hortefeux will take his seat in Parliament and on its bodies and will enjoy all the rights attaching thereto, provided he has previously made a written declaration stating that he does not hold any office incompatible with that of Member of the European Parliament.

Because of their concerns that the conference would be used as a platform for expressions of hatred and intolerance in its most extreme form, several Member States, including my own, decided to withdraw from the conference. These concerns were confirmed by the intervention of one member of the UN at the very beginning of the conference. Not only did we find this totally unacceptable, but it was directly contrary to the very spirit and purpose of the conference.\nIt is unfortunate, although perhaps inevitable, that this incident and the subsequent walk-out of all Member States as well as other UN members, made the news headlines, overshadowing the consensual adoption of the outcome document. At the same time, I think that the very constructive and solid EU contribution through the preparatory phase of the conference should be fully acknowledged. This was particularly the case in relation to the drafting of the outcome document, in which the EU played a critical role. Despite the distractions to which I have referred, the fact that the final outcome document of the conference respects all the EU red lines represents a considerable achievement.\nThe outcome document fully respects the existing human rights framework, particularly with regard to freedom of expression, and complies with many of our demands, such as the ", "Explanations of vote\nPedro Guerreiro  \nin writing. - (PT) We regard the sustainability of fishery resources as essential for the continuation of fishing activity and the viability of the fisheries sector, but we do not accept a fleet management policy - as adopted in the EU - or a reduction in the fleet, the main consequences of which will be a significant reduction in the means of production and a drastic loss of jobs.\nTo achieve the objective of a sustainable balance between fishing capacity and fishing opportunities, account must be taken of the social and economic situation in the fisheries sector by applying mechanisms for subsidising or compensating fishermen affected by the economic consequences of an environmentally friendly fishing activity and by measures to reduce fishing, especially in less-favoured regions that are dependent upon the fisheries sector.\nSimilarly, the fishing effort should be matched to existing resources and to the protection of the marine environment - which would at one and the same time promote small-scale coastal fishing and non-industrial fishing and safeguard fishing communities; it would be particularly helpful in that context to increase Member States' exclusive fishing zones from the current 12 nautical miles to 24 nautical miles and for outermost regions from 100 nautical miles to 200 nautical miles.\nRobert Navarro  \nI voted in favour of the report by my colleague Mr Casaca because it clearly underlines the perverse effects of the current system, which sometimes causes decisions to be taken that are disconnected from local realities.\nTake, for example, the case of thonaille fishing in the Mediterranean. Those who do it have made efforts to develop their fishing methods, but legislation adopted recently is putting disproportionate restrictions on them that are in danger of causing their disappearance. They are in fact facing unfair competition from their colleagues in the Eastern Atlantic, both Spanish and French. In accordance ", "6. (\n- Before the vote on Amendment 39:\nIlda Figueiredo\nrapporteur. - (PT) Mr President, this oral amendment is supported by female Members from five political groups and also by one male Member. It aims to amend the first part as follows: 'Stresses the need to retrain those women who have had to stop their career, to enhance their employability' and then continues 'calls on the Member States to increase life-long learning possibilities'. This is the amendment that we are tabling.\n(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)\n", "Social reality stocktaking (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Elizabeth Lynne, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on social reality stocktaking.\nElizabeth Lynne  \nrapporteur. - Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs. That a report of this scale has received no plenary amendments shows this is truly a report from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and one we can all be proud of. I would also like to thank the Commission for its close cooperation and the Portuguese Presidency for making social policy a priority for its Presidency.\nWe face a huge challenge in Europe. That challenge is one of fairness. It is about lost potential, the inability to live a life free from the charity of others, and a life free from discrimination, poverty and social exclusion.\nOur objective is clear: we want to expand opportunities so that nobody, whatever their background or circumstances, is left behind. The vision of Europe must be freedom and opportunity for all, increasing opportunities and incentives to work, whilst strengthening the safety net for those who are unable to work.\nIn 2007 the facts are chilling: 72 million European citizens continue to live in poverty; 8 % of all people in the European Union now suffer from in-work poverty. Those are truly shocking statistics. But what do they actually mean? They mean that one in six citizens is now living below the poverty line - one in six! Many people would not believe that could be possible in 2007. Fifty years after the Treaty of Rome, after 50 years of economic growth, 10 % of people belong to households where nobody has a job! By any measure, poverty remains one of the greatest social problems challenging Europe, and reducing social exclusion must be at the heart of our policies.\nIn some areas we are succeeding, but we must be frank: in the majority we are not. The gap between the rich and the poor in many EU Member States is increasing. The elimin", "Progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals: mid-term review in preparation of the UN high-level meeting in September 2010 (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the report by Mr Cashman on progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals: mid-term review in preparation of the UN high-level meeting in September 2010.\nMichael Cashman\nrapporteur. - Madam President, can I say, as I begin, I think we should really call these not 'Millennium Development Goals', but 'millennium development challenges'. So often the word runs off our tongue - 'the MDGs' - but do we ever actually revisit what they are?\nBack in the year 2000 when we were going through economic boom times, we made promises and we made commitments. Sadly, colleagues, those commitments have not yet been achieved. We are five years away from the date that we set, 2015, when we would tackle these major challenges.\nLet me restate them: the major challenges are extreme poverty and hunger, access to universal primary education, gender equality, child mortality, maternal health, AIDS, malaria and TB, environmental sustainability and global partnership for development: eight millennium development challenges which still remain challenges. And now, during this week, the EU will come together to hopefully forge a united position ahead of the September plenary at the United Nations in New York.\nBut I have to say the signs are worrying. There is a lack of commitment to that 0.7% of our gross national income that we said we would commit to taking on these challenges. In some of the least developed countries we are slipping way, way away from the targets that we need to be reaching mid-way through.\nThere has been some progress and, yes, the investment that we have made - and I use that term wisely - the investment that we have made so far has paid off. The maternal health improvements are there. Child mortality rates are low, low, low and, yes, the numbers of children", "Recent earthquake in Haiti (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statement on the earthquake in Haiti by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and Vice-President of the Commission, Baroness Ashton.\nWe will also hear from Commissioner De Gucht, but the first to take the floor will be Baroness Ashton. It gives me much pleasure to welcome her because I have worked extensively with her elsewhere, and I wish her all the best in her new position.\nCatherine Ashton\nHigh Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you very much indeed for your kind words. Honourable Members, I asked for this debate to be able to update this House on the situation in Haiti following the terrible earthquake of 12 January. The losses are devastating and the damage is enormous. Up to three million people have been affected by the tragedy, and the death toll continues to mount.\nThis is a massive humanitarian and political disaster. Our immediate focus is on working with the United Nations and the Haitian leadership to ease the suffering of the Haitian people. Our commitment to rebuilding Haiti is long term. Many European citizens have also lost their lives, and around 1 000 are still unaccounted for.\nThe EU has responded quickly, not seeking headlines but with a total focus on getting help to the people in need. On advice from the United Nations, we resisted the urge to travel to Haiti immediately. That would only have diverted attention and scarce resources away from the relief effort. We will, of course, travel to Haiti as soon as it is appropriate, and I have agreed with Commissioner De Gucht that he will travel to Haiti this week to extend the EU's condolences and underline our commitment to the people. He will also take the opportunity to review our aid efforts so far and discuss with the United Nations and our people on the ground the most pressing needs for the weeks a", "Common rules in the field of civil aviation security (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Paolo Costa, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules in the field of civil aviation security and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 -.\nPaolo Costa\nrapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we are today celebrating the conclusion of a procedure that started as far back as September 2005.\nThe road that we have travelled has been long and in some cases difficult, but ultimately I feel that it was worth the effort. The issue at stake is the security of civil aviation. The regulation that we had in force, that has been in force up to now, was adopted in the emotional climate surrounding the attacks on the Twin Towers on 11 September 2001. It had a difficult birth, but was then approved and applied and, while it has had some success in recent years, there have been practical gaps and inadequacies.\nIt is for that reason that we are now about to revise it. The aim is to provide a more flexible response to technological, psychological and behavioural changes in the fight against terrorism, obviously taking account of the experience that we have gained up to now. Security and protection from terrorist attacks are an obvious priority, but cannot be discussed in isolation. They have to be seen in a slightly more balanced context.\nChecks have to be stringent and efficient, but should not overly inconvenience passengers, and their application should not entail unnecessary costs. Costs should possibly be shared and should not be borne entirely by passengers. It is for that reason that new checks cannot be introduced without adequate democratic scrutiny. It is on those two points - costs and democratic accountability - that Parliament's delegation focused it", "Decision on urgency\nArias Ca\u00f1ete\nMadam President, the Committee on Fisheries has agreed to accept urgent procedure and to ask for this to be placed on the agenda for the procedure without debate.\n(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)\n\nPresident\nThe report will therefore be put to the vote on Friday morning.

Many of the working methods and organizational structures used by the national customs services vary widely and urgently need to be brought more closely into line with each other. At first reading we adopted a number of amendments to the programme, many of which the Commission has incorporated in its amended proposal.\nThe Council, however, has made it clear in its unanimously adopted common position that it has differen", "Welcome\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, before proceeding to the vote on the budget, I would like to inform you that the President of the Chilean House of Deputies, Mr Antonio Leal Labr\u00edn, is here with us in the official gallery.\n(Applause)\nMr Leal Labr\u00edn is accompanied by Chilean MPs Mr Gonzalo Duarte Leiva and Mr Germ\u00e1n Becker Alvear. We welcome them and thank them for visiting us.\nBruno Gollnisch\n(FR) Mr President, this is indeed a point of order and also a reminder of Rule 188 of the Rules of Procedure. We have just learned, following the meeting of the Bureau, that the Israeli Government would like to exclude Mrs Le Pen from the political discussions of the Israeli delegation. She is a member of that delegation in a spirit of debate, dialogue and openness.\nI should like to express our thanks to Mr Brok for his perfectly correct attitude and to say very clearly that, when Mr Krivine was similarly excluded by a decision of the United States Government, we agreed entirely, whatever the difference of opinion between us, that it was not for the host government to determine how the European Parliament's delegation should be composed.\nI therefore dare to hope that, in your capacity as guarantor of the rights of all Members of the European Parliament, you will be anxious to make this point to the Israeli authorities.\nMartin Schulz\n(DE) Mr President, you should give the floor to Mr Brok first, as he has something he wants to say on the subject; I am quite happy to state my position afterwards, and so I ask to be given the floor after Mr Brok has spoken.\nPresident\nThe Conference of Presidents has decided to postpone the visit of the ad hoc delegation to Lebanon, Israel and Palestine, and I hope that this is a satisfactory response to the concern expressed.\nThank you for drawing Parliament's attention to this issue.\nCarlos Carnero Gonz\u00e1lez\n(ES) Mr President, as you know, I try to be serious when I speak and, since the Rules of Procedure state that all documents handled of", "7.

We wish to reiterate to the Council our willingness as Parliament to enter into negotiations on the EUR 5 billion that the Commission has proposed for revision. Our amendment reads as follows, therefore - I shall read it out in English, as we have been working in English, so as to get all our fellow Members on board as quickly as possible:\n'Expresses its strong willingness to enter into negotiations with the Council on the basis of the Commission's proposal for a revision of the MFF 2007-2013 for EUR 5 billion in the framework of the proposed European Economic Recovery Plan; takes note of the conclusions of the December 2008 European Council in that respect'.\nJutta Haug\nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, this concerns the European schools in Brussels. We have discussed this at length in the course of many talks. The figures previously in the text need to be tightened somewhat, as we want the Commission to really take action. Therefore, the new text also sets a deadline for it to do so. I shall read it out in English again:\n'Notes with concern the situation of present and future young pupils in the European Schools in Brussels resulting from the delayed and still pending opening of the fourth school in Laeken and the current enrolment procedure leading to long and unacceptable travelling times for the children; expects the Commission, in cooperation with the Secretariat-General of the European Schools in Brussels, to present a revised enrolment procedure by the end of March 2009 with objective and comprehensible criteria (including the principal residence and already enrolled siblings), which will come into force with the next enrolment period'.\n(The oral amendment was accepted)\n- After the final vote:\nRobert Goebbels\nVery nice, very n", "Poverty reduction and job creation in developing countries (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Eleni Theocharous, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on poverty reduction and job creation in developing countries: the way forward.\nEleni Theocharous\nrapporteur. - (EL) Mr President, we all know that both Africa, in particular, and other regions of the world crippled by both poverty and democratic deficits are the soft underbelly of the international system.\nI agreed to draft this report, obviously with the help of all the political groups, in the firm belief that the European Union can help to combat poverty in numerous ways, mainly by creating jobs. Of course, the European Union needs to help about half the population of the planet who are living below the poverty line.\nBearing in mind the lack of trust and suspicion on the part of the peoples of underdeveloped countries towards developed countries and the possible reaction on the part of the peoples of Europe to the constant drain on resources to fund the poor, we have tried to clarify from the start that developing the third world will have significant benefits for the European Union itself in every way: for example, developing jobs may help to address uncontrolled migration and, at the same time, reduce instability in poor countries.\nOf course, also bearing in mind that the basic precondition to development is the establishment, restoration and improvement of democracy and democratic institutions and the operation of democratising institutions and, of course, the safeguarding of human rights and the rights of the child and action and involvement by civil society, we included this as a particularly important factor.\nWe set particular store on improving education and the free choice of scientists and other skilled workers to remain in their country.\nParticular account was taken of the AIDS pandemic and its consequences as particularly aggravating factors which help to sustain the vic", "The placing of biocidal products on the market - New biocides revision proposal (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following:\nMrs S\u00e2rbu's report, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 98/8/EC concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market as regards the extension of certain time periods - C6-0346/2008 -, and\nthe Commission statement on the new proposal for a revision of the Biocides Directive.\nDaciana Octavia S\u00e2rbu\nI would like to emphasise that I regard as a success the agreement which we have reached together with the Commission and the Council on extending the period for evaluating active substances until 2014 in order to create in good time a regulated market for biocidal products.\nThis has also been reflected in the result of the vote taken by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. This is why I would like to thank my colleagues who supported this compromise between the three institutions.\nExtending the transitional period is extremely important for guaranteeing that all biocidal products containing active substances will be placed on the market legally.\nI felt that it was essential for the review of this directive to be carried out at first reading so as not to risk going beyond the 10-year period for the systematic examination of biocidal products and, by implication, avoid the risk of their withdrawal from the market as from 2010.\nThe extension of the period will ensure that Member States have sufficient time to evaluate these substances up until 2014 when the substantive revision of the Biocides Directive will most likely come into force.\nAnother item proposed in the draft report is to limit to a maximum of two years the possibility of further extending the deadlines for the remaining dossiers through comitology in order to avoid the possibility of endlessly de", "Industrial policy for the globalised era (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Lange, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Industry, on an industrial policy for the globalised era.\nBernd Lange\nMadam President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, this report presents the position of the European Parliament very clearly. I would like thank the shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to the report and the rapporteurs for the opinion of the relevant committees.\nTogether, we have succeeded in conveying a clear message, Mr Tajani, which is that we want to move industrial policy closer to the centre of the political arena, for good reason. Industrial policy will help us, firstly, to create good quality, future-proof jobs in Europe and, secondly, to secure investment in Europe. Our competitors all over the world are making good use of industrial policy, for example, in the United States, China, Brazil and India. Thirdly, we are faced with challenges relating to sustainability, both in terms of the climate and the economic and social foundations of our society. Against this background, it is important for us to put industrial policy at the centre of the political arena.\nOn the one hand, this means that we expect industrial policy to be integrated in such a way, Mr Tajani, that it becomes the focal point of legislative initiatives within the European Union. We do not want to see environmental, trade and competition policies being drawn up first and only subsequently being coordinated with the interests of European industry. On the contrary, we must define the other areas of policy on the basis of the strategic interests of a sustainable industrial policy.\nSecondly, Mr Tajani, we need better coordination between the industrial policies in the different Member States. Therefore, I would like to ask you, and we have included this in the report, to make use of Article 173(2) of the Treaty of Lisbon, in order to coordinate industrial policy in the Memb", "One-minute speeches (Rule 150) \nPresident\nThe next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.\nCzes\u0142aw Adam Siekierski\n(PL) Madam President, today is the 61st anniversary of Schuman's declaration. Many official celebrations, festivals and parades are taking place to commemorate the anniversary. Do not let the celebratory mood blind us to the problems with which the EU is currently wrestling. Firstly, we must reply to the question whether the national self-interest which has appeared in the negotiations over the next financial perspective is in accordance with the calls for solidarity of our founding fathers? Secondly, are initiatives which reverse European integration, such as the latest initiative to restrict the Schengen area, compatible with the spirit of Europe? Finally, does the current crisis in the euro area and the lack of solidarity of Member States in tackling it present a threat to the success of this ambitious project?\nUnfortunately, there are many more examples pointing to a crisis in European integration. On this anniversary, let us take the opportunity to reflect seriously on what to do to stop these detrimental tendencies, and to return to proper, dynamic integration in the future. Let us renew the spirit of Europe according to the ideas of Robert Schuman, so that the successes we have had so far in our common project do not fall by the wayside.\nCsaba S\u00e1ndor Tabajdi\n(HU) Madam President, on Europe Day, I would like to speak about the Community idea. The legislative package on economic governance represents a new chapter in the life of the Union. If observed and enforced, the new system of economic policy governance might finally encourage the Member States of the European Union to establish responsible economic policies. However, this is only one of the conditions of stability of Europe.\nThe democratic regression recently seen in several Member States is a disturbing phenomenon. The governments of certain Member States have cr", "Publication and translation obligations of certain types of companies (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs P-N. Kauppi, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directives 68/151/EEC and 89/666/EC as regards publication and translation obligations of certain types of companies - C6-0171/2008 -.\nPiia-Noora Kauppi\nrapporteur. - Mr President, this report is part of the simplification package on company law. It is very important that in the European Union we try to simplify the environment for companies to flourish and to create growth for the European economy. The aim is to diminish administrative burdens as regards publication and translation obligations of certain types of companies. The proposal is part of the wide-ranging administrative burden reduction exercise; it would free up and redirect business resources and thus enhance the competitiveness of European economies.\nNowadays, under the First Company Law Directive, companies need to publish certain information in the national gazettes that has to be entered into the Member States' commercial registers. In most cases, publication in the national gazette entails additional costs for the companies without providing any real added value. The objective of this proposal is therefore to remove any additional publication requirements in national law that cause additional costs to the companies.\nAnyhow, the Commission leaves flexibility for Member States concerning these additional publication requirements. It is still possible for Member States to have additional requirements, but these should be covered by the single fee proposed for the new electronic platform.\nMember States should all have electronic platforms containing the full information and providing access to this information in the companies' electronic file in the register. This would be a cost-effective and easily accessible way of providing a", "Application of the law on customs and agricultural matters (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Bill Newton Dunn, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters - C6-0033/2007 -.\nSiim Kallas\nVice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, this third report is very much linked to the two previous ones. Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs or agricultural matters is a very important piece of legislation dating back to 1997, when we had 15 Member States.\nIt was essential to propose an amendment to Regulation (EC) No 515/97 in the light of developments in the last decade, technological progress, successful experience with joint customs operations coordinated in Brussels, and the enlargement of the Union to 27 Members.\nI would like to pay tribute to the rapporteur, Mr Newton-Dunn, for the way he has guided this proposal through Parliament. I would also like to thank Mr Audy, who drafted the opinion. The two committees, IMCO and COCOBU, worked closely together using the enhanced cooperation mechanism. Their excellent work has enabled a compromise to be brokered between the various political actors. Thanks to the constructive approach of Parliament, a first-reading adoption of this legislation can now be achieved.\nCustoms authorities apply controls on goods entering and exiting the Community based upon a common risk management framework, including the use of random checks. In this context, their task is generally ", "Interpretation of the Rules of Procedure\nPresident\nI have been informed by the Green Group, pursuant to Rule 162(4), that it contests the interpretation of the provisions governing the discharge procedure that was announced to Parliament yesterday.\nI would therefore remind the House that, as announced yesterday, the vote on this interpretation will take place at voting time today, in other words at 12 noon.\nThere is of course no question of us holding a debate on this matter now.\nRule 162 is perfectly clear. We shall vote at 12 noon. However, I will give the floor to Mrs Theato, who has asked to speak as chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control.\n\nTheato\nMadam President, I should like to request that the opinion drawn up by the Legal Service - which contains statements on this point -should also be made available to groups and Members. I do not know whether all Members have now received this opinion. Yesterday, it was also submitted to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities.\n\nPresident\nThat is difficult, Mrs Theato, since the interpretation has been given by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure. It is that interpretation which has been contested, and the House knows its mind well enough to decide freely for itself. It will do that at 12 noon today.\n\nApproval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nJanssen van Raay\nMadam President, on 12 January 1999, Mr Wijsenbeek and I are required to attend the Court of Justice in Luxembourg at 9.30 a.m. in proceedings on a question referred for a preliminary ruling on the basis of Article 177 by the District Court in Rotterdam. We are therefore faced with a choice. We would have to leave Strasbourg very early in the morning to travel to Luxembourg and would therefore probably miss the voting, so we must choose whether to go to Luxembourg or stay here to vote. Who should decide? This is a question that I rai", "Formal sitting - India\nPresident\nMr President, honourable Members, it gives me great joy to be able to welcome, today, to this House, to the European Parliament, the President of the Republic of India, Mr Abdul Kalam. A very warm welcome to you, Mr President.\nBefore your election as President, you were well known as the architect of the Indian space and atomic energy programme, and you enjoy international renown as one of India's most important scientists. Most of your previous life has been devoted to science and technology, and you have always given voice to the view that developing countries should take second place to others when it comes to harvesting the fruits of the most highly-developed technology, because technology - when used rightly - creates growth and can help to improve the day-to-day life of the poor. I do not doubt that this House agrees with your views and is therefore glad that India is participating in the research programmes funded by the EU, collaborating, for example, with us on Galileo.\nAlongside the key role you played in promoting science and technology, we were also impressed by your election as President of the Republic of India in 2002, in which you achieved an overwhelming majority with votes from across all party divisions, and that, for you, as a Tamil and a Muslim in a country with a Hindu majority, was no mean achievement; it is evidence of your great ability to bring together people of every background, culture and religion. India is a country of many peoples and religions, and, as the largest democracy in the world, it can encourage new and young democracies.\nThe relationship between the European Union and India has been in existence since the early 1960s, when India was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with what was then the European Economic Community.\nOur contacts and cooperation at the parliamentary level are among the positive results of a long-term process, for the first meeting between the Europ", "21. CAP: common rules for direct support schemes and certain support schemes for farmers and support for rural development (vote) \n- Report: Jan Mulder\nPresident\nWe will now adjourn the session for the formal sitting for the award of the Sakharov Prize. We will continue subsequently with the explanations of vote.\n(The sitting was suspended at 11.50 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon)\n", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nFrank Vanhecke\n(NL) Mr President, in the end I voted for the two reports on the updating of the Schengen Information System. However, I should like to add that I still believe that the implementation of the Schengen Agreements has made our borders a sort of glorified sieve, that they have become much more insecure and less controlled.\nSince Schengen we are absolutely all just as vulnerable as the weakest link in the border controls and that creates especially serious problems. However, if the system does exist and continues to exist, I do of course have a duty to support controls that are applied as efficiently as possible and the exchange of information. That is why I voted in favour, but that should certainly not be taken as approval of the open borders policy of the European Union.\nJosu Ortuondo Larrea\n(ES) Regrettably, for reasons beyond my control, I could not take part in yesterday's debate on this directive on ship inspection and survey organisations. I want to take advantage of this opportunity to express my satisfaction that this directive has been adopted by Parliament with the recommendations of the Committee on Transport and Tourism.\nThere were a couple of aspects that were not clear enough or properly dealt with in the common position adopted by the Council. The first was that ship classification societies, when acting on behalf of national administrations - because it is the responsibility of flag States to guarantee the safety of ships - must be covered by the same legal guarantees as when it is the national administrations that are acting.\nSecondly, I believe we have properly clarified the financial liabilities in the event of an incident. The Council common position did not clearly distinguish between the three possible cases - where these incidents cause the deaths of people, where they cause personal injury or where they simply cause property damage - so Parliament has sorted this out and ensured that", "Statement by the President\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, the Conference of Presidents has asked me to make a statement on the events in the Middle East. The debate will take place on Wednesday afternoon in the presence of the Chairman of the Council of Foreign Ministers, Czech Foreign Minister Schwarzenberg. I mention this because it was not quite clear. We have put a lot of effort in and found him very willing to be with us, although he will have to travel to South Africa on the same day, if only for a limited time I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Czech Presidency most sincerely for this.\nLadies and gentlemen, whilst we are holding a plenary session at the start of the New Year here, people are once again dying in the Middle East.\nPersonally, and I am sure the same goes for most of us, I find I have a painful sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu when I see the pictures on the television.\nIn the name of the European Parliament, I would like to express my deepest regret on the escalation of the Gaza conflict between Israel and Hamas.\nI say quite categorically: it is not acceptable for people to suffer, for violence to continue and for United Nations employees to come under fire. How far must the spiral of violence go until sense and reason prevail?\nThe violence must cease immediately on both sides. The firing of rockets on Israeli towns and cities by Hamas is completely unacceptable and deserves the harshest criticism and we must not forget that it was Hamas who ended the ceasefire. Yet the proportionality of the means employed in the response must not be disregarded.\nAll people in the Middle East have the same worth. The inalienable right of a state to protect itself does not justify violent actions, the primary consequence of which is the suffering of the civilian population.\nThe people in the Gaza Strip must be given urgent help. A Palestinian is worth the same as an Israeli or a European or an American - all people on this earth are equal. We must not allow a wor", "Membership of political groups\nPresident\nI have today received letters from Ms Daniela Buruian\u0103-Aprodu and Mr Cristian St\u0103nescu announcing their decision to leave the ITS Group. Parliament takes note of this decision with effect from today, 14 November 2007.\nTaken together with the announcements already made this week concerning three Members leaving the group, I conclude that the number of members of the ITS Group has now fallen below the minimum of 20 Members required to form a political group laid down by Rule 29(2).\n(Loud applause)\nParliament therefore takes note of the fact that the ITS Group no longer fulfils the conditions of the Rules of Procedure for the formation of a Group. As a consequence, the group ceases to exist with effect from the moment of this announcement.\n(Applause)\nHans-Peter Martin\n(DE) Mr President, I should like to bring to your notice that, when I, like many other Members, was applauding your last announcement, Jean-Marie Le Pen made this hand gesture, signifying (EN) 'Fuck you!' (DE) directly at me. May I ask you to check that on the video recording. I believe such an action really must have consequences. I find it appalling that anyone should behave towards me in such a downright aggressive manner.\nPresident\nThank you, Mr Martin, I did not see it myself, but I take note of your point.\n", "Statement by the President\nPresident\nGiven the tragedy that has struck the region of Murcia and specifically, the town of Lorca, I should like to express, on behalf of the Presidency, our solidarity with that community and with all the victims, several of whom have been killed.

Hence this oral question.\nWe here in the European Parliament have always taken rail safety very seriously. This has culminated in the recent Rail Safety Directive and follows on from a long line of railway initiatives and reports taken by Parliament over many years.\nYet we have a frustration born out of the inability over the years of both railway companies and national governments to act in key areas. This manifests itself when you examine key legislation and, in particular, the implementation of such legislation in international law, which has been at best patchy and at worst downright protectionist.\nThe Commission's own progress report on the implementation of the Rail Safety Directive says that national standards and rules are creating a barrier to a fully integrated rail system. This then poses the question as to whether those national rules are also compromising safety.\nAnd what about interoperability in the rail sector? Are national barriers preventing progress in this area as well, or is there an unwillingness on the part of the rail industry to embrace the concept of interoperability?\nWhy is progress on ERTMS so slow and are we going to fail in our attempt to have the ECM scheme in place by the end of next year?\nThese are a", "Immigration - Legal migration - Policy priorities in the fight against illegal immigration of third-country nationals (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on\nthe statements by the Council and the Commission on immigration,\nthe report by Mrs Lilli Gruber, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the policy plan on legal migration and\nthe report by Mr Javier Moreno S\u00e1nchez, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on policy priorities in the fight against illegal immigration of third-country nationals.\nManuel Lobo Antunes\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is still facing considerable challenges in terms of its response to the changing migration situation.\nThe Global Approach to Migration, which was adopted by the European Council in December 2005, still forms the basic framework for defining the response to these challenges. On adopting the Global Approach, the European Council underlined the need for a balanced, global and coherent approach, covering policies to combat illegal immigration and, in cooperation with third countries, harness the benefits of legal migration. Implementing the Global Approach has been an essential priority for successive presidencies.\nThe Global Approach to Migration has not remained static but has been refined and developed by the European Council in light of events and progress made in its implementation. It is now integrated within the comprehensive migration policy of the European Union.\nAt its meeting of 21 and 22 June this year, the European Council adopted conclusions on the expansion and reinforcement of the Global Approach. These conclusions in particular provide for the application of the Global Approach to neighbouring regions to the east and south-east of the EU and for the development of partnerships between the European Union and third countries in terms of circular m", "\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 27 April 2006. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Ladies and gentlemen, I regret that I have some sad news to communicate to you: the passing of our fellow Member, Professor Rolandas Pavilionis\nMr Pavilionis was a fervent defender of human rights, he fought actively for Lithuania\u2019s independence and then for his country\u2019s accession to the Union, before being elected a Member of the European Parliament.\nBefore that accession, Professor Pavilionis had taken part in the work of the Convention on the future of Europe.\nHe was highly active in the fields of education, science and culture and I would like to stress his position as rector of the University of Vilnius.\nWe shall all remember him for his work in our Parliament, as a member of the Committee on Culture and Education.\nHe was vice-chairman of his Group, the Union for Europe of the Nations, in which he was greatly valued by his fellow Members for his intellectual qualities.\nI would also like to inform you that tomorrow there will be a book of condolence in front of the Chamber, which will be open for all Members and anybody who wants to record a final remembrance to sign.\nI would now ask that we observe a minute\u2019s silence in his memory.\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Mr Hans-Peter Martin has the floor for a point of order.

In the same way that we keep a close watch on our Member States to make sure that they do not violate the right to freedom, or to life, or to democracy, we must have a decisive influence through dialogue on those countries with whom we have political, trade, economic or partnership relations, etc., so that they also respect human rights.\nWithin the complexity and magnitude of the EU's external relations, the space occupied by dialogue and human rights consultations with third countries could go unnoticed or remain in the background. If that were the case, and we were to allow it, we would be making a very serious mistake.\nThis report deals with the aspects that are necessary to improve a task that is an EU obligation, according to EU Article 11 of the EU Treaty, and which also comes under political ethics. Human rights should be the banner of EU external policy and the EU should use its influence to improve the living conditions of people in the countries with which it has relations. This is one of the key political elements in this report.\nWhen we sit down to negotiate economic or trade agreements with a country in which fundamental rights are violated, we cannot put figures, agreements and contracts on the table while shamefully brushing under the carpet the situation that its citizens are going through.\nIf we leave human rights outside the negotiating room, we will be falling into the most macabre cynicism. We also need to take a close look at the role played by civil society and human rights defenders, significant voic", "Explanations of vote\nHiltrud Breyer\nMr President, I am very disappointed that in Mrs Westlund's recommendation for second reading it was not possible to impose a ban on azo-dyes. This is indeed very disappointing because labelling does not guarantee safety. Parliament has now lost control in this area and has simply given in, and has unfortunately not applied the precautionary approach. That is very regrettable.\nIn exactly the same way we find it very disappointing that we were unable to include and regulate genetically modified additives, which would really have signalled how seriously we take the subject of consumer protection. However, the most regrettable thing is that we have failed to protect children from azo-dyes. The alarming findings of the Southampton study make it quite clear that we must call for a ban and that we need a ban.\nWhat indeed does the precautionary principle state other than that we have to accept the conclusions when there is an indication of risk? In this case the conclusions clearly point to a ban. Moreover, while the general ban ultimately failed I find it very regrettable that we have still not succeeded in obtaining a ban on products that are mainly intended for children.\nNeena Gill\nMr President, I voted in favour of this report, because I support the approach that has been taken.\nI welcome the harmonisation of the use of food additives in flavourings across the EU. A single regulation on food additives will help monitor, update and amend existing legislation in this area and contribute towards greater food safety.\nI am concerned very deeply about the risk that such additives and flavourings have on health and also the impact on children, with some E numbers damaging to their intelligence, and they can also cause allergies and other diseases.\nHowever, whilst we need greater transparency and better food labelling, we need to be mindful of the diverse populations who live in Europe and who are used to using ingredients from across the gl", "Containers lost at sea and compensation (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on containers lost at sea and compensation by Brian Simpson, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism - B7-0469/2010).\nBrian Simpson\nauthor. - Mr President, as you said, I speak this morning on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism on an issue that has been overlooked for so long, namely containers falling from ships at sea.\nIt is amazing to me that, in this modern day and age, thousands of these containers go missing each year, with the great majority of them falling off the ships into our oceans. It is estimated that a staggering 10 000 containers are lost at sea each year. It would appear to us that shipping lines and insurers are quite happy to accept this figure and do nothing about it. In European waters, 2 000 containers a year are lost at sea, and this figure would appear to be rising year on year. These containers are a menace to navigation, they could pollute the seas with both toxic and non-toxic materials, and they leave local authorities with large clean-up costs.\nThe Transport Committee is now demanding action to reduce this figure and is sending a signal to the maritime industry that we are not prepared to tolerate this state of affairs much longer. The MARIN Institute in the Netherlands found the main reasons for container stack collapses were faulty lashings, overweight containers and faulty stowage. In addition, crews on larger container ships have difficulty in assessing when severe loads are moving forward and/or aft due to weather conditions, which can amplify vertical acceleration in these areas beyond the vessel's actual design specifications.\nMoreover, the absence of a strict liability compensation convention for non-toxic substances leaves local government picking up the cost of the clean-up. Parliament is now demanding that shipping companies accept their responsibilities on this issue. We woul", "Order of business\nPresident\nThe final version of the draft agenda for this part-session as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 20 November 2008 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed. It has been requested that this draft be amended as follows:\nWednesday\nThe Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance propose postponing both the voting on the report by Mrs De Keyser on the participation of the State of Israel in Community programmes and the voting on the motions for a resolution regarding the same topic.\nFrancis Wurtz\nMr President, our request is based on a very clear fact known to everyone. At the end of last May, an official delegation from our Parliament, representing all political groups, went to Israel and visited the Palestinian territories including Gaza.\nOn the basis of what they observed on the ground, at the end of this visit, they unanimously adopted a statement. This statement includes the following:\n'We strongly feel that without serious signs of good faith translated into tangible improvements on the ground, the time is not yet right to upgrade EU-Israel relations'.\n(FR) Since then, no such significant signs have been apparent, quite the contrary. This is why we think that it would be a very bad signal today if we were to vote in favour of the recommendation made by the Council.\nMy group proposes that we postpone this vote until there is evidence, in Israel's policy and on the ground, of these famous signs called for unanimously by the delegation representing our Parliament a few months ago.\nDaniel Cohn-Bendit\non behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, sometimes we must take very difficult decisions.

Mediation in civil and commercial matters (vote) \n- Before the vote:\nArlene McCarthy \nrapporteur. - Mr President, just a little bit of respect for a rapporteur from my colleagues would be appreciated!\nI shall be very brief. It was not possible to schedule a debate on this report; there are no amendments; we are voting because we want to now open discussions with the Council and the Commission.\nI also wanted to say that this is not the last word, and we reserve the right to reopen some of these compromises if necessary with the Council and the Commission to ensure that mediation truly works for our citizens and that we achieve our objectives. We can now move to the vote.\n", "\n\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013 The next item is the joint debate on:\n1. the report by Jerzy Buzek (A6-0202/2006), on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the seventh framework programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (2007 to 2013) (COM(2005)0119 \u2013 C6-0099/2005 \u2013 2005/0043(COD)), and\n2. the report by Jerzy Buzek (A6-0203/2006), on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision concerning the seventh framework programme of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) for nuclear research and training activities (2007 to 2011) (COM(2005)0119 \u2013 C6-0112/2005 \u2013 2005/0044(CNS)). \nJanez Poto\u010dnik,\n\u00a0\u00a0 . Mr President, today is an important day for science. With your support, we can look ahead to a EUR\u00a054.5 billion research programme to be launched by the end of this year. EUR\u00a054.5 billion in current prices is less than we had proposed, but it is a substantial increase on the current programme and we also have to thank Parliament for that. Together, we are making the Seventh Framework Programme a programme for boosting growth and jobs, for promoting a sustainable and healthy Europe.\nIt is also a programme for a stronger Europe: research unites in diversity. For that to happen, we need cooperation, ideas, people and capacities and those are the titles of the four main axes in the Framework Programme.\nThe cooperation programme will bring together our best talents from across Europe to research and develop and find answers on economic opportunities and societal challenges, for example in the areas of health and energy. The ideas programme will introduce a new mindset in supporting and conducting research in Europe. The people programme will attract and motivate the best scientists to work across Europe or beyond, for the benefit of European research. The capacities progra", "Approval of the Minutes of the two previous sittings\nPresident\nThe Minutes of the sittings of Thursday 3 February and Monday 14 February have been distributed. The Minutes of 3 February were originally distributed in Brussels so perhaps this is why some Members did not receive them.\nAre there any comments?\n(The Minutes were approved)\n\nMedina Ortega\nMadam President, my habit is always to be here for the opening of the part-session on Monday afternoons at 5.00 p.m. Yesterday it was impossible for myself and many MEPs to be here, because the 2.15 p.m. Air France flight, which normally brings us here, was cancelled, with no explanation from the airline, and we therefore arrived very late. If Air France insists on boycotting the European Parliament, we should take measures to prevent this occurring again.\n\nPresident\nThank you, Mr Medina Ortega. I too wholeheartedly regret this situation. Would you be so kind as to write to me so that I have proof with which to tackle the competent authorities of both Air France and the French Government? This situation really cannot continue and we must therefore protest most strongly.\n\nNapolitano\nMadam President, I had the same experience as Mr Medina Ortega yesterday.\nI feel that the French authorities - which have the honour of housing the European Parliament in Strasbourg - should be aware of their responsibility to ensure adequate connections with all the capitals of the Union.\n\nPresident\nAbsolutely, Mr Napolitano. Thank you.\n\nLannoye\nMadam President, off the subject of aeroplane delays, I wish to apologise for the absence yesterday of my colleague in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Caroline Lucas, who is a British Member. She could not be here because she was arrested yesterday morning during an anti-nuclear demonstration in Glasgow. Although her identity was noted and her position as a Member of the European Parliament was very apparent, she was still held in custody all day. I regard this as absolutely unacceptabl", "2. (\n- After the vote on Amendment 62:\nAlexander Alvaro\n(DE) Mr President, now that Parliament in its infinite wisdom has adopted compromise Amendment 62, Amendment 61 as proposed by the ALDE Group is now superfluous and is therefore withdrawn.\n", "Address by the President\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, once again, I should like to convey my heartfelt thanks for the trust you showed in me by electing me President of the European Parliament yesterday. To follow the various Presidents who have left their mark on the history of our Parliament ever since it was first elected by direct universal suffrage, and to follow you, Jos\u00e9 Maria Gil-Robles, who so successfully led Parliament along the path of democratic progress\nApplause\ncalls for modesty rather than pride, in that the honour which I feel gives way immediately to an awareness of the burden which we must bear together and I can assure you, as far as I am concerned, that it will be exciting but also demanding.\nTo those colleagues who voted differently, I must say, in all sincerity, that once he or she has been elected, the President must be everyone's President. A first among equals. The President is merely the instrument of the smooth operation of parliamentary democracy. To remain faithful to my convictions and to the group which nominated me as President, but also to take up the task with rectitude and impartiality, whilst respecting our political or national differences, is how I see my role and its moral code. As Vice-President during the last few years, that was how I always tried to behave. I shall continue in the same spirit.\nThe conditions under which the election was held marked a step forward in the democratic workings of the European Parliament. It allowed all Members, whatever the size of their group, to participate openly; it took account of the balance of power established by the citizens who elected us on 13 June; in addition, it allowed each person to express his or her preference, as dictated by conscience.\nAs I said yesterday, I am grateful to Parliament for taking into account another aspect of this democratic equilibrium. During the life of the previous Parliament, 23 % of Members were women. Today, the figure is nearly 30 %.\nApplause\nSinc", "Explanations of vote\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, I should like to make a proposal: as there are a number of you who have requested several explanations of vote, when I give you the floor, please provide all your explanations, in sequence, in one speech.\nOral explanations of vote\nJim Allister\nMr President, every day more and more of my constituents find it nigh impossible to make ends meet. Then I pick up a report like this and I discover that EUR 1.6 billion of European taxpayers' money has been spent on this edifice that is the European Parliament, then I discover that EUR 9.3 million has been lavished upon the political parties in the European Parliament, and then I look and see a reaffirmation of a commitment to a 30% reduction in carbon emissions by 2020, but not a single mention of the most outrageous emission of all - that which flows from the unnecessary travel to this place, 12 times a year. This report is appalling in what it exposes as regards the conduct of this Parliament.\nRichard Corbett\nMr President, let me put Mr Allister's comments into context: the European Parliament costs each citizen GBP 1.74 - I say 'pounds' for the benefit of Mr Allister - per year. By comparison, the House of Commons costs each of its citizens GBP 5.75 per year; the House of Lords GBP l.77 for each citizen of the United Kingdom. In other words, this Parliament is far cheaper to operate per citizen.\nHowever, that does not mean we must rest on our laurels. Of course we should be vigilant, and of course we should cut costs. The point made by Mr Allister about the 12 part-sessions a year costing so much money in Strasbourg is, of course, a correct observation. But this decision does not lie in the hands of the European Parliament: it lies in the hands of the Member States, who, unfortunately - in Edinburgh, under the chairmanship of John Major - made it a legal obligation for the European Parliament to come here 12 times a year. I would call on the Member States to reconsider ", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nBernard Wojciechowski\n(PL) Mr President, new forms of crime and specialised criminal groups of an international nature present an enormous challenge to prosecuting agencies in the Member States.\nEffective prosecution of offenders and the fight against the most alarming manifestations of lawbreaking are not possible without the creation of appropriate tools that the police can use to enforce the law. In the case of a problem such as cross-border crime, the rapid exchange of information between services in individual countries is essential if offenders are to be identified and actions coordinated. DNA databases and digital fingerprint records are a very important tool in the fight against crime. They enable an offender to be identified regardless of where the crime was committed.\nThe D\u00fchrkop D\u00fchrkop report on the stepping up of cooperation between prosecution agencies in combating terrorism and cross-border crime is a valuable initiative that reinforces the action in favour of greater security for US citizens that was initiated in 2005 by the Pr\u00fcm Treaty.\nSyed Kamall\nMr President, as we know, this report calls for an extension of the Pr\u00fcm Treaty into the fight against cross-border terrorism. We all agree on the need to combat terrorism. That goes without saying. We all agree on the need for cross-border cooperation. However, the Pr\u00fcm Treaty is about the enforced sharing of data, regardless of concerns over the protection and security of that data. Judging by the newspaper stories on the integrity of police forces in certain Member States, we should all be concerned about that sharing of data.\nThe actual content of the report would in fact significantly breach the civil liberties of citizens right across the EU, because the collection and passing-on of DNA data to other EU Member States becomes obligatory for the first time.\nWe are sleepwalking into a 'Big Brother' Europe, while our politicians stand idly by.

We would like to extend a warm welcome to them. They are taking part in the 29th EP/Japan Interparliamentary Meeting that is being held in Brussels and Vienna from 2 to 6 June.\nThe Japanese delegation is led by Mr Taro Nakayama, a great friend of Europe, and is made up of seven members of the House of Representatives and two members of the House of Councillors.\nThis Interparliamentary Meeting has focused on climate change in order to promote a common approach based around the application of the Kyoto Protocol and what will come after it.\nWe are very happy with this fruitful, stable and continued cooperation with Japan, a country with which we share the basic values of democracy, respect for human rights and the principle of multilateral cooperation. Therefore, welcome to our Japanese friends!\n(Applause)\n", "13. Macro-financial assistance for Ukraine (\nBefore the vote:\nVital Moreira\nrapporteur. - Madam President, this is just a brief explanation of what we are going to vote on.\nIn November last year, here in Strasbourg, when we were discussing the approval of four previous macro-financial assistance proposals regarding other countries, the Commission promised us that, under the Lisbon Treaty and until the adoption of a framework regulation for macro-financial assistance, all future individual proposals for such assistance would be subject to codecision by Parliament and the Council. Now, only six months later, you have in front of you not only a proposal for a codecided decision, but also a first-reading agreement with the Council. In trying to reach that agreement, we were operating under a very tight timetable. Therefore, I would like to express my recognition and gratitude to the Spanish Presidency, the Council and the Commission, as well as to the shadow rapporteurs on the Committee on International Trade and everybody involved, for their positive and constructive approach.\nUnder the proposed decision, Ukraine could get a loan of up to EUR 500 million in order to finance its balance of payments deficit and meet external financing needs. This loan would supplement IMF support and the EU assistance of EUR 110 million that was agreed back in 2002 but has not yet been disbursed.\nDuring our informal trialogue negotiations, Parliament insisted on keeping references to certain disbursement conditions that were important for us, such as the efficiency, transparency and accountability of the assistance. We also insisted on the importance of Parliament being kept duly informed about the actual implementation of the assistance.\n(Applause)\nIn protecting our institutional prerogatives, we also resisted demands to introduce a management committee procedure for implementing measures so that finally an advisory committee...\n(The President cut off the speaker)\n", "2. Nepal\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on Nepal.\nLidia Joanna Geringer de Oedenberg\nBenjamin Franklin once said that 'the US Constitution does not guarantee happiness, only the pursuit of it'. Today, the citizens of Nepal cannot even count on being able to pursue happiness.\nWork on the constitution continues to drag on, and the main actors on the political stage, including the Maoist Unified Communist Party of Nepal, are not ready for compromise, while the army is still surrounded by an atmosphere of secrecy regarding how it is financed and the way it recruits. Meanwhile, at the opposite pole and far from the structures of the state, 30 million citizens are exposed to extreme poverty and illiteracy, and do not have access to electricity or communications. Nepal is stuck in a trap of poverty, and is squandering the natural potential of its strategic geographical location and exceptional natural features. Therefore, we appeal to the Nepalese authorities not to squander the 2008 peace agreement, but to strive consistently for promulgation of the new constitution, which would not only define the rights and responsibilities of citizens, but could become a symbol of a new democratic page in the history of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal.\nAs a Member from a country scarred by historical divisions, I understand what a difficult period is currently being experienced by Nepal. A constitution and international appeals will not guarantee the citizens of Nepal happiness, but may help them to pursue it.\nCharles Tannock\nauthor. - Mr President, Nepal's political instability is hardly surprising given the tumultuous changes that have taken place in that country over the last two decades. The palace massacres of 2001 fatally undermined the monarchy, and King Gyanendra's attempts to impose absolute rule to combat Maoist insurgents failed dismally. The Maoists took power and abolished the monarchy two years ago, but were quickly displaced by a coalition of their oppone", "One-minute speeches on matters of political importance\nPresident\nThe next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.\nTunne Kelam\nMr President, thank you for your congratulations on the anniversary of the enlargement of the European Union.\nAt the end of this term, I should like to pay tribute to the activities of Parliament's Baltic Europe Intergroup, which has drawn practical conclusions from the last enlargement, with the Baltic Sea becoming, in fact, the Union's internal sea. It has initiated a new European policy - the Baltic Sea strategy. We can be truly satisfied that, under the creative and skilful leadership of Christopher Beazley, the Baltic Sea strategy has won the support of the Commission and will soon be introduced by the Swedish Presidency. Therefore, I strongly suggest that the activities of this intergroup be continued in the next European Parliament.\nImplementation of the Baltic Sea strategy will be a long process that needs parliamentary supervision and, occasionally, reports. I also hope that the activities of the intergroups, as a basic form of parliamentary democracy, will not be restricted in the next European Parliament. Here I am repeating the message delivered by my colleague Mr Bushill-Matthews.\nGlyn Ford\nMr President, I want to urge you to intervene with the Commission on behalf of a group of my constituents. The citizens of Gibraltar, whom I have had the honour of representing formally for five years and informally for two decades before that, are gravely concerned about the cancer clusters that have recently been discovered both in Gibraltar and on the Spanish side of the border.\nIt is difficult when you are in Gibraltar not to see, and occasionally smell, the smoke and pollution from the refineries adjacent to the border, and the concern is that these are the causes of the cancer clusters.\nWhat we would like to see is a joint investigation on both sides and jointly agreed terms of reference, to try and alleviate ", "Order of business\nPresident\nThe final version of the draft agenda for this part-session as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 18 September 2008, pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.\nMonday, Tuesday and Thursday:\nNo amendments\nWednesday:\nThe Liberal Group has requested an extension of the deadline for the tabling of joint motions for resolutions and amendments on the priorities of the European Parliament for the legislative and work programme of the Commission until 10 a.m. tomorrow - Tuesday, 23 September 2008.\nThe vote is scheduled for Wednesday, 24 September 2008.\nDaniel Cohn-Bendit\n(DE) Mr President, last weekend the Irish press revealed that there may be a link between those who funded the 'no' campaign in Ireland and the Washington Pentagon and the CIA. That was a very interesting story, the reason given being a desire to stop Europe becoming too strong. I wish to ask the President to investigate the matter. We should also ask the Council - the Council and the Commission - to provide us with information about this at the next opportunity, for it would certainly be interesting to find out the truth behind this whole shady 'no' campaign in Ireland that received EUR 1.2 million in funding. I therefore ask the President to pursue this matter so that we obtain information and uncover the background to this story.\nPresident\nThank you, Mr Cohn-Bendit. Let me say to you that I have already been following this whole development very attentively for some time now. We must maintain absolute transparency, because, as you know, these people who attack us demand that we act transparently - and they themselves, of course, should practise what they preach. We need absolute transparency about the amount of money paid to Libertas, the organisation represented by Declan Ganley, and where the money came from.\nWe learned from the Irish media - and I am repeating here what was reported last week in Ireland - ", "Common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings - Food additives - Flavourings and certain food ingredients with flavouring properties - Food enzymes (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following recommendations for second reading on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety:\non the common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings (16673/2/2007 - C6-0138/2008 - (Rapporteur: Mrs Westlund);\non food additives (16675/2/2007 - C6-0141/2008 - (Rapporteur: Mrs Westlund);\non flavourings and certain food ingredients with flavouring properties for use in and on foods and amending Council Regulations (EEC) No 1576/89 and (EEC) No 1601/91, Regulation (EC) No 2232/96 and Directive 2000/13/EC (16677/3/2007 - C6-0139/2008 - - (Rapporteur: Mrs Dr\u010dar Murko);\non food enzymes and amending Council Directive 83/417/EEC, Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, Directive 2000/13/EC, Council Directive 2001/112/EC and Regulation (EC) No 258/97, (16676/1/2007 - C6-0140/2008 - (Rapporteur: Mrs Doyle).\n\u00c5sa Westlund\nrapporteur. - (SV) Mr President, I want to begin by thanking the Commission, Commissioner Vassiliou and her always helpful staff, the Slovenian Presidency, the Council of Ministers, my fellow rapporteurs, Avril Doyle and Mojca Dr\u010dar Murko, and of course the shadow rapporteurs from all the parties for excellent cooperation over the years we have worked on these matters.\nI am glad that we have now settled on a compromise which brings simplification for the industry and at the same time strengthens consumer protection in a number of areas.

Obviously some people are more equal than others in this Chamber. I understand that the Commissioner was in a hurry, so that I could not be called upon to raise my point of order.\nTime should have been used efficiently when discussing the last item on the agenda. It is with regret that I find that the President was a little too generous with his allocation of time in the debate. We cannot allow so many people to wait for the catch-the-eye procedure throughout the entire process. However, Madam President, it would seem that you are not listening to me either. A system obviously operates in this House whereby good time-keeping is regarded as unimportant.\nWhen we hear numerous references to solidarity from our fellow Members, a word they seem to use in every second sentence, while going over their allotted time by at least twenty to thirty seconds, then I would contend that this flies in the face of their expressions of solidarity. I would ask you to take my request to the Conference of Presidents and that the otherwise esteemed previous speaker should try to keep to his allotted speaking time in future. That way, we will not lose so much time. It would then be possible to allow one or other of my fellow Members to speak using the catch-the-eye procedure, without restricting them to a minimal amount of time.\nFrancesco De Angelis\n(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the Sommer report because I firmly believe that Europeans should be able to make a free and informed choice about what they eat.\nIn adopting this report, Parliament is giving the green light to clearer rules on food labelling.

Paragraph e) of the French version of yesterday's minutes, on transatlantic relations and the Echelon system, translates the English expression 'STOA studies' as if it read 'STOA report' . STOA prepares studies, not reports, which are the preserve of parliamentary committees. I should therefore like the French translation service to get into the habit of referring to STOA studies and not reports, so that European Parliament committees can hold on to their independence and powers.\n\nPresident\nYour comment concerned a linguistic correction, Mr Pompidou, and we must clearly do all we can to improve the text and make it more accurate.

Given that most of these persons belong to ethnic minorities, does the Council intend to adopt or propose formats for passports and other similar documents which no longer include negative details such as 'aliens', and thus put an end to discrimination based on ethnic origin?\nJanez Lenar\u010di\u010d\nPresident-in-Office. - (SL) I have a rather brief answer. Namely, that the issuing of passports or travel documents to stateless persons permanently resident in a Member State does not fall under the competence of the Community.\nTherefore, neither the European Commission nor the Council is competent to propose any changes in connection with this sort of passport, or any other travel documents.\nManuel Medina Ortega\n(ES) Mr President, the reply from the President-in-Office of the Council is very clear indeed: there may be no discussion of this kind of issue. Perhaps I ought to ask the question in slightly different terms. Can the Council envisage any kind of EU harmonisation in relation to passports and identification of passports, or does it feel this issue will be permanently beyond the Member States' jurisdiction?\nJanez Lenar\u010di\u010d\nPresident-in-Office. - (SL) Mr Medina Ortega, thank you very much for your additional question.\nAt this point the only common standards or common benchmarks that have been adopted are those in the sphere of security elements, passports or other travel documents.\nPersonally, I could anticipate further measures in this sphere; as for any others, I could not speculate whether there will be any transfer of competence.\nThis is not a question of whether this matter is importan", "Mortgage credit (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the report by Mr Purvis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on mortgage credit in the EU.\nJohn Purvis \nrapporteur. - Mr President, what I was trying to tell you before was that Mr Allister's speech was coming through in a foreign language on the English channel, so the English was being translated into something else, I do not know what. I am sorry Mr Allister, but we could not make out what you were saying!\nEuropean mortgage loans outstanding amount to some EUR 5 trillion, or 45% of the EU's GDP, and mortgage lending has grown by 9.4% per annum over the past five years. A home is usually the largest purchase made in a lifetime, and the related mortgage is the most important financial obligation most people ever have. It is no surprise, therefore, that the Commission has focused on this area as it shifts its attention to retail financial services.\nThe mortgage market is fragmented along national lines and opening up this market should lead to consumers being offered better value and a greater choice of mortgage products. There could be more opportunities for those people who currently find it difficult to get a mortgage, such as first-time buyers or people with fixed-term contracts. It should make it easier for people moving to another EU country for work or retirement or wanting to buy a second property abroad.\nFor lenders, a more integrated market would offer greater economies of scale, reduce costs and lower rates for the borrower. On the other hand, local culture and traditions have shaped the products available and consumers will not want any diminution of existing consumer protection standards. Full harmonisation would be expensive for the industry and could limit the range of products it offers. The industry is highly competitive within most of our Member States, so we must not take heavy-handed action that might damage this booming sector. We want to see a European m", "Collective management of copyrights on-line (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the oral question by Giuseppe Gargani on the collective management of copyrights on-line - B6-0459/2008).\nJacques Toubon\nMadam President, this question is central to the future cultural economy of Europe. Despite the existence of the Directive on copyright in the information society the situation in terms of the collective management of copyright and related rights for online services is extremely complex, particularly because of the territorial nature of copyright law and the absence of a pan-European licensing system. This situation has been made even more complicated by the lack of a coherent policy on the part of the European Commission, with the Directorate-General responsible for the single market and copyright, on the one hand, and the DG for competition policy, on the other, often acting for their own account and without any overall view of the sector concerned, especially as regards the interests of the creative talents of Europe.\nIn fact, by refusing to legislate and also by ignoring the different resolutions adopted by Parliament and opting instead to attempt to regulate this sector by way of recommendations and administrative decisions the Internal Market and Services Directorate-General has created a climate of legal uncertainty. Against this background we now have the Directorate-General for Competition starting legal proceedings against a player in this sector that was only trying to act in compliance with the Commission recommendation of 2005.\nThus the Commission took this decision against CISAC in July. It did not impose financial penalties but rather sought to change the way that CISAC and its member associations operated. This situation reflects the fact that the European Commission chose to ignore the warnings that had been expressed by Parliament, particularly in its resolution of 13 March 2007, which also contained concrete proposals for controlled competition as w", "The cohesion policy after 2013 (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the oral question to the Commission by Danuta Maria H\u00fcbner, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the cohesion policy after 2013 (O-0121/2009/rev. 1 - B7-0229/2009)\nDanuta Maria H\u00fcbner\nauthor. - Mr President, three years ago, a major reform of European cohesion policy was introduced taking into account the unprecedented enlargement of the Union and new emerging challenges.\nIt was not by chance that, back in 2005 and 2006, the top priorities for European cohesion policy were: the Lisbon strategy, innovation and competitiveness, climate change, energy security and efficiency, water efficiency, investment in new skills, attractiveness of territories for young people, and quality of life.\nIt is because we have understood that the mission of cohesion policy is to anticipate change, not to follow it, that we have put on the cohesion policy agenda for 2007-2013 all those priorities which we see today in the Commission's Europe 2020 agenda.\nThat is why, more than two years ago, the Regions 2020 analytical report was published. The purpose was to know what the cohesion policy priorities should be after 2013. Today, we are well prepared to face the future.\nA year ago, the policy put all its assets at the disposal of the European Recovery Package, thereby also providing the essential link between the exit strategy from a real economic crisis, on the one hand, and long-term sustainable growth and structural transformation on the other.\nBut our oral question is about the future. In years to come, the Europe we live in will be in need of strong collective action to respond to the expectations of its citizens, who are today informed citizens, fully aware of how much depends on choices made by policy makers. Those expectations are confirmed by public opinion polls.\nJacques Delors once said that the European single market is about competition that stimulates, about cooperation that makes us stronger", "6.

Before Parliament votes on the joint motion for a resolution by certain groups on freedom of movement, I would like to condemn most firmly on behalf of my group the personal attack in paragraph 13 thereof on the Vice-President of the Commission, Franco Frattini.\nI wish to denounce a politically undignified manoeuvre by the Italian Socialists, taken up by certain of my fellow Members, which is unworthy of the challenges we face. More serious still, this untruthful distortion of Mr Frattini's comments, which our institution must reject, will mean we cannot make a composed decision.\nIf our group were to vote against this resolution because of this manoeuvre, this would not in any way diminish our support for all the Romanian and other EU nationals who obey the law and respect their host country.\nEurope is founded on the rule of law, something we reaffirm in the resolution my group has signed on the joint initiative of our Italian and Romanian colleagues. The question of freedom of movement is not just a national matter, but a European one. It is not a case of settling political scores, but a question of values, ladies and gentlemen.\n(Applause)\nMartin Schulz\non behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, we held an extensive debate in this Chamber in which Commissioner Frattini took part. The Commissioner responded very moderately in his own comments and in his answers to speeches from various Members. The resolution criticises only one point; that is, that it can be proved that Commissioner Frattini gave the public incorrect information on a specific point of European law.\nThe fact that our resolution corrects ", "2. Protocol to the EC-Switzerland Agreement on the free movement of persons (participation of Bulgaria and Romania) (\nBernd Posselt\n(DE) Mr President, could you please send for a technician? This voting machine is broken. It is completely destroyed. I did indeed vote before, and I would ask you to take note of that.\n", "Request for the waiver of parliamentary immunity: see Minutes\nSonia Alfano\n(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before the vote, I should like to take a few moments to remind the House, the Council and the European Commission that two years ago, there was an earthquake in L'Aquila in which 309 people died and over 1 650 people were injured. Now I have raised the matter, I will send all MEPs today a video that was filmed in L'Aquila on 13 January. I urge all colleagues to look at it because the citizens of L'Aquila are waiting for a strong response from Europe.\nPresident\nThank you, Mrs Alfano. I, too, during this morning's debate, mentioned this terrible anniversary. You were quite right to remind this packed House of it.\nDavid-Maria Sassoli\n(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last night, there was another tragedy in the Mediterranean. Immigrants from north Africa died trying to reach Italy and Europe. There are 130 missing and 20 bodies have already been found.\nWhen it comes to immigration, we must never forget that we are talking about men, women and children, not just numbers. There must be no more reticence; the Council and governments must act. Civil and democratic Europe must show its sorrow and, for this reason, Mr President, I ask you to invite the House to observe a minute's silence in memory of the victims of immigration.\n(Applause)\nPresident\nThank you, Mr Sassoli. - Of course, I will grant your request. Before asking the House to observe a minute's silence, to reflect on the memory of these victims, I would like to give the floor to Mr Tavares who has asked to speak on the same subject.\nRui Tavares\nMr President, we have received information that a boat from Libya carrying refugees has capsized in the Mediterranean. We know that there are dead bodies and 150 people are missing.\nAlmost a year ago, this Parliament approved a codecision instrument providing for an emergency mechanism in order to resettle refugees who were under armed attack or in cris", "Damages actions for breach of competition rules (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report, by Mr S\u00e1nchez Presedo, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Green Paper on Damages actions for breach of the EC antitrust rules\nAntol\u00edn S\u00e1nchez Presedo \nrapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner Kroes, ladies and gentlemen, the existence of economic freedom, the functioning of the internal market and the sustainability of European development are inextricably linked to the competition policy. Since the Treaty of Rome was signed 50 years ago, its importance has continued to grow. Competition is an indicator of European vitality and excellence, a key policy in terms of fulfilling the Lisbon Strategy and achieving the Union's objectives.\nAnti-competitive infringements make the game unfair, impact on flows of exchanges amongst Member States and damage confidence in the rules. They reduce the Union's dynamism and results. It is important that we have dissuasive and reactive mechanisms.\nInfringements have been dealt with principally by means of public actions of an administrative nature. The centralisation of the application of Article 81(3) - through a priori control by the Commission, toned down by means of the exemption regulations from the 1980s onwards - was a victim of its own success; the demand for more and better competition revealed its economic inefficiency and its legal shortcomings.\nThe role of private actions was stressed by the Court of Justice of the European Communities when the 2001 Courage v. Crehan judgment recognised that anybody could have recourse to national judicial bodies in order to claim damages resulting from the actions of the infringer.\nThe modernisation of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 of the Council put an end to the Commission's monopoly and recognised a more open system, applicable in a decentralised manner by the administrative authorities making up the network of Community competition authorities and also dire", "Loss at sea of migrants' boats off the Libyan coast (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the loss at sea of migrants' boats off the Libyan coast.\nJacques Barrot\nMadam President, the European Commission was dismayed to learn of the loss, on Sunday evening in the Mediterranean, off the coast of Libya, of a ship carrying migrants bound for Europe. According to some sources, this ship had 257 people on board, the vast majority of whom are missing.\nThe Commission wishes to express its compassion for the victims of this human disaster and its anger in the face of this tragedy. It was doubtless caused by many factors, but the primary responsibility must lie with those criminal organisations that are directing this deadly illegal traffic from the coasts of Libya and who are growing rich at the cost of human misery. The Commission finds it intolerable that this phenomenon, which seems to be intensifying over the course of the years, continues to grow. It invites all the parties concerned to mobilise their efforts to bring it to an end.\nLibya has an essential role to play here. It must make a more determined and effective commitment to the fight against the traffickers operating on its territory, to the prevention of illegal departures from its coasts, to the search and rescue of ships in distress in the waters under its control, and to the offer of international protection to those migrants who require it, in accordance with its obligations under the 1969 OAU convention on the protection of refugees, to which it is a signatory.\nOver the last few years, the European Commission has asked the Libyan authorities several times to assume their responsibilities and to introduce effective measures, in cooperation with the European Union and its Member States. I have to say that we have offered increased financial assistance to Libya, and it is evident that the Libyan authorities need to use this assistance to improve the fight against the trafficking of m", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Tuesday, 23 March 1999.\n\nStatement by the President\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, a terrible fire broke out in the Mont Blanc tunnel on 24 March killing at least 40 people, some of whom have yet to be identified. The scale of this tragedy caused great dismay not only in France and Italy, but throughout the European Union. Although it occurred some weeks ago, I am sure I am speaking for all of us in expressing our sorrow at these deaths and our sympathy for the victims' families. We hope that the investigations being carried out will prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future.\n\nAgenda\nPresident\nThe next item is the order of business.\nThe final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents pursuant to Rule 95 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed. The following amendments have been proposed.\nMonday and Tuesday: no changes\nWednesday:\n\nPresident\nAt the request of Mrs Bonino, who has to return to Brussels to prepare for humanitarian measures relating to Kosovo, I am proposing that we take the report by Mr B\u00f6ge and Mrs Roth-Behrendt on the BSE follow-up before the report by Mr Herman on the functioning of the institutions.\nIf this debate is not concluded before Question Time, it will be continued immediately afterwards, before the suspension of the sitting.\nIf there are no objections, we shall take that to be approved. Are there any comments?\nParliament approved the proposal\nThe Group of the Party of European Socialists is asking for the report by Mrs Myller, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, on accession strategies for environment, to be brought forward from Friday to Wednesday and included in the joint debate on the seven reports by the Foreign Affairs Committee on accession applications.\nMrs Green has the floor to present this request.\n\nGreen\nMr President, it seems entirely logical that this report, which i", "Statute of the European Private Company, Company Law (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the oral question by Giuseppe Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, to the Commission on the state of play in the legislative proceedings on the 'Statute of the European Private Company' and of the 'Fourteenth Company Law Directive' - B6-0137/0000).\nGiuseppe Gargani  \nauthor. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on this question is very important both institutionally and politically, bearing in mind that it is of considerable political and institutional significance.\nI should like to say very clearly, and I take responsibility for my words, that the European Commission has seriously failed the European Parliament since it has failed to follow up Parliament's formal requests and has failed to present proposals for legislation on European Private Companies and relocations of head offices of capital companies.\nA proposal for legislation on the statute of the company was formally requested in February 2007, on the basis of Article 192 of the Treaty and - as I would like to stress, and I would ask the Commissioner to listen because this is a very important oral question, Mr President, to which an answer must be given - after a thorough debate, together with a hearing with qualified and representative experts who showed us how necessary such an instrument was and how useful it would be in fostering small enterprises keen to operate effectively in the internal market.\nIt was the Commission's duty, Commissioner, immediately to launch the procedure for adopting the legislative proposal, starting with an impact assessment. The Commission already had, moreover, a feasibility study from December 2005, but did nothing and instead took its time until in July it launched a consultation on the need - here again no more than a hypothetical discussion - for a European Private Company, as though Parliament, as the elected representative of the Union ", "12. Exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the EU's Stabilisation and Association process (\nVital Moreira\nrapporteur. - Mr President, I have an oral amendment to my own written amendment. In Amendment 14, I propose to replace 'countries' by the expression 'countries and territories'.\nThe purpose of this amendment is quite straightforward. It is meant to align the wording of this paragraph with the title of the regulation itself. The title reads as follows: 'exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the European Union's Stabilisation and Association process'. Without this correction, there would be a discrepancy between the regulation itself and its title. That is why I ask for your support and the adoption of this amendment.\nVital Moreira\non behalf of the Committee on International Trade. - Mr President, I have a mandate to ask for the postponement of the vote on the legislative resolution.\nPresident\nDoes the Commission have something to say on this?\nM\u00e1ire Geoghegan-Quinn\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission welcomes the Member's proposal. It will leave time for more examination of the amendments that were adopted, and will allow Parliament and the Council time before the first-reading vote.\nPresident\nThe report is referred back to the Committee on International Trade.\n", "Question Time (Commission) \nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B6-0009/2009) which, exceptionally, will last until 8 p.m.\nI begin by informing you that Mr Kov\u00e1cs will not be present, so Questions Nos 1 and 3 from the first part of this period, addressed to the Commissioner, will be taken up by Mrs Reding.\nThe following questions have been submitted to the Commission.\nPart One\nPresident\n\nSubject: Measures for the promotion of products and services that help increase energy efficiency and promote renewable energies\nAt the Spring European Council in 2008, the Heads of State and Government agreed on a future review of the Energy Taxation Directive aimed at promoting an increase in the percentage of renewable energy as a proportion of the total energy used.\nIncreasing energy efficiency is one of the quickest, safest and cheapest ways of reducing EU dependence on third country energy resources, lowering energy consumption and cutting CO2 emissions and the European public's expenditure on energy bills.\nIn the light of the need to increase energy efficiency, could the Commission indicate what measures and financial and fiscal instruments it has in mind to promote products and services that help increase energy efficiency and promote renewable energies?\nViviane Reding\nMember of the Commission. - It is in its European Economic Recovery Plan - which has, by the way, been endorsed by Parliament and the Council - that the Commission supports the promotion of the rapid take-up of green products. It has, among other things, proposed reduced VAT rates for green products and services aimed at improving the energy efficiency of buildings in particular. Furthermore, the Commission encourages Member States to provide further incentives to consumers to stimulate demand for environmentally-friendly products.\nThe Commission is currently carrying out a review of the existing Community tax legislation. The objective is to eliminate as much as possible existing incentives that run cou", "13. Application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments in criminal matters (\n- Before the vote:\nArmando Fran\u00e7a\nrapporteur. - (PT) This report was a good example of understanding and cooperation in Parliament and of cooperation between Parliament and the Council. I therefore thank my fellow Members, the representatives of the Council, the technical staff and everyone involved in this complex and difficult report.\nThe framework decision will be very important for criminal justice in the EU. It promotes the principle of mutual recognition, ensures that the rights of the defence and guarantees of the accused are strengthened, makes the enforcement of decisions rendered in absentia quicker and more effective, and helps to combat crime in Europe. The future framework decision will also help to strengthen the primacy of the law and the rule of law, and promote European integration. The strong consensus obtained in the LIBE Committee was crucial and should be reiterated here and now. Thank you everyone.\n", "8. Economic Recovery Programme: energy projects (\nReimer B\u00f6ge\non behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, after consulting briefly with the rapporteur, we agreed that paragraphs 2, 3 and 5 of the legislative resolution should be adjusted. I would suggest the following English text for paragraph 2:\n'Considers that the reference amount indicated in the legislative proposal is compatible with the multiannual financial framework as the latter has been revised;'\nIn paragraph 3, the first sentence should be deleted, the rest remaining unchanged: 'Recalls that any redeployment that would lead...' and so on.\nParagraph 5: 'Recalls that the legislative process has been completed after the financing of the programme has been agreed;'.\n", "Revision of Council Directive 94/45/EC of 22 September 1994 on the establishment of a European Works Council (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission Statement on the revision of Council Directive 94/45/EC of 22 September 1994 on the establishment of a European Works Council.\nVladim\u00edr \u0160pidla\nMember of the Commission. - (CS) Thank you for the opportunity to discuss two closely connected issues, the European Works Council and responsible restructuring, which the Commission considers to be of paramount importance and on which we have made significant progress during the past year.\nAs far as the European Works Council is concerned, the Commission believes that in order to improve the legal framework of the European Works Council action at Community level is required. European Works Councils are not automatically consulted on instances of restructuring. In addition, there is legal uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the Directive, and it is necessary to ensure a better link between the information and consultation of workers at national and supranational levels and between the relevant Directives.\nAs you know, on 20 February the Commission launched a second consultation with the social partners regarding the revision of the Directive. In doing so, the Commission suggested several approaches the Directive could take with a view to solving the aforementioned issues. These relate primarily to changing the definitions, strengthening the rules to be applied where is no agreement, employee training, amendments to the agreements in the case of significant changes such as mergers, and implementation of an agreed system for mutual dialogue at national and supranational levels.\nThis consultation preceded the submission of the Commission's legislative proposal. It gave the social partners an opportunity to discuss the issue. The social partners are undoubtedly in the best position to ensure a positive impact of the revision of the Directive, which is fundamenta", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nRichard Corbett\nMadam President, I welcome the fact that this report looks at what can be done at European level to stimulate the economies, whilst I recognise that most of the instruments to do so remain at national level: 99% of public expenditure is national, not European; most regulation is national, not European. But if we look at what we can do at European level, the plan proposed by the Commission for a EUR 30 billion contribution, including advance payments from Structural Funds and new loans from the European Investment Bank, can and will make a real contribution to coming out of this crisis.\nWe must also make sure that we avoid protectionism in Europe. A beggar-your-neighbour approach by different countries would weaken our common market and seriously damage the prospects of job creation and economic growth in the long term. On the contrary, freedom of movement for workers and initiatives to help businesses' exports to the single market will help provide the stimulus needed for our economic recovery.\nCarlo Fatuzzo\n(IT) Madam President, I voted in favour of the joint text on improving safety for those who choose to travel by sea. I think it is very important to add that more should be spent on the professionalism of all seamen responsible for navigation - from the captain, to the chief engineer, to the boatswain, to the master-at-arms, to the helmsman and to all seamen - because the lives and safety of men at sea depends on them. I therefore call for more professionalism and better salaries for those who hold the lives of maritime passengers in their hands.\nSimon Busuttil  \n(MT) On this report I would like to say that despite its initiative in favour of the environment, there was still a lack of consideration regarding the negative and disproportionate effects that it would have on the regions and countries that are situated on the periphery of the European Union, as Malta is. This initiative could potentially ", "Formal sitting - Grand Mufti of Syria\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, it is a special honour and pleasure for me today, in this European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, to extend a warm welcome to the European Parliament to His Eminence Sheikh Ahmad Badr El Din El Hassoun, Grand Mufti of Syria.\n(Applause)\nAs I emphasised last week in Ljubljana at the opening ceremony for the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, the European Parliament attaches great importance to this year of dialogue between cultures.\nI am firmly convinced, as are many others, that it is both possible and essential for people from different cultures and religions to live together in peace, both within the European Union and in the world at large. Particular importance attaches in this context to our relations with the peoples on the opposite shores of the Mediterranean and in the Middle East. The fact is that the fruits of this dialogue will have a lasting effect on our common future. Together we must build an intellectual and cultural bridge across the Mediterranean, embedded in mutual enrichment and shared values.\nWe build this bridge when we engage in continuous, honest and open dialogue in which we listen to each other, exchange our opinions frankly and develop mutual understanding.\nTolerance is at the heart of intercultural dialogue. Tolerance does not mean indifference. Tolerance means putting forward our own points of view and hearing and respecting other people's convictions.\nWhere we find it impossible to accept another person's point of view, it is still necessary to treat such views with respect, to exchange ideas and opinions peacefully and, wherever possible, to pave the way for joint action and thereby defuse tension.\nWe must stress the things we have in common, including the substance of universal democratic values. Foremost among these are human dignity and the defence of inalienable human rights.\nIn the course of 2008 and thereafter, the European Parliament will take several op", "3. Kosovo (\nJelko Kacin\nMr President, on Monday morning there was an assassination attempt on our colleague Peter Miletic, a member of the Kosovo Assembly and a group leader of the Serb minority Liberal party Samostalna Liberalna Stranka. He was shot twice and wounded.\nHe is one of us, a parliamentarian. An attack on an MP anywhere amounts to an attack on democracy. This attack was aimed at the efforts to bring lasting stability to the region of the Western Balkans. He is in intensive care in hospital in Mitrovica. Let us wish him a quick and full recovery and express to him our full political and human support.\n(Applause)\nPresident\nWe all concur with what you have said.\nBefore the vote on Amendment 11:\nPier Antonio Panzeri\n(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I call for the words 'all the people' to be deleted when reference is essentially being made to the dialogue. Therefore, the final sentence should be: 'considers that both parties should take a pragmatic approach to the dialogue for the benefit of Kosovo and Serbia'.\nUlrike Lunacek\n(DE) I would just like the official title of the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice to be included.\nI will read it in English. The official wording is 'the Accordance with International Law of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence by the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government of Kosovo'.\nUlrike Lunacek\nMr President, this refers to the very recent violent events in Kosovo, one of which my colleague, Mr Kacin, has already mentioned where an ethnic Serb Member of the Kosovo Parliament, Petar Mileti\u0107, was shot last Monday. Together with this Parliament, I wish him a very speedy recovery.\nThere was another incident and it was not possible to make reference to it before the end of the amendments so I will read this oral amendment: 'Expresses its deep concern at the deadly blast that killed one person and injured 10 others that took place in Mitrovica North on 2 July during the demonstrations against the o", "Applicable law in matrimonial matters - Amendment of regulation as regards jurisdiction and introducing rules concerning applicable law in matrimonial matters (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on:\nthe report by Mrs Gebhardt, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 as regards jurisdiction and introducing rules concerning applicable law in matrimonial matters - C6-0305/2006 - and\nthe oral question by Mrs Gebhardt and Mr Deprez, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, to the Commission, on the Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 as regards jurisdiction and introducing rules concerning applicable law in matrimonial matters - B6-0477/2008).\nEvelyne Gebhardt\nMadam President, ladies and gentlemen, today, we are discussing an issue that is of the utmost importance to citizens. Our Europe is a pleasant place where people enjoy increasing mobility. It is a place where, increasingly, marriages are taking place between nationals of different countries or couples are moving to a different country, and of course this is a good thing and is one of the accomplishments of the European Union. Unfortunately, there is also a drawback to this accomplishment, however, which is that these marriages often end in separation, and then there is the issue of the necessary divorce.\nCurrent law is so unsatisfactory in some respects that a couple may be unable to find a competent judge or law for their divorce. Naturally, this is a very unpleasant situation for these citizens, and we must come up with a solution and an answer. This concerns people's lives, which are of the utmost importance.\nI am pleased that the European Commission has tackled the subject, therefore, and I should like to reiterate straight away that there is to be no harmonisation of the law in this matter - indeed this is not permitted, and it i", "Regulation applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Daniel Caspary, on behalf of the PPE Group, Kader Arif, on behalf of the S&D Group, Niccol\u00f2 Rinaldi, on behalf of the ALDE Group, Yannick Jadot, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, Joe Higgins, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, and Robert Sturdy, on behalf of the ECR Group, on the Regulation applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences - B7-0018/2010)\nDaniel Caspary\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), the European Union is currently granting market access by way of reduced import duties to 176 developing countries. These are benefits that we as the European Union offer without expecting anything in return from our partners. There is also GSP+ for certain countries facing particular challenges and for those that fulfil special conditions.\nWhat is our starting position? We will need a new regulation from 1 January 2012 onwards because the old one will have expired. We need time for a proper procedure that gives us the opportunity to have two readings. On behalf of my group, I therefore expect the Commission to submit a new proposal as quickly as possible. As I said, we need sufficient time for a procedure with two readings and it would be unacceptable if we, as the European Parliament, were to have to take dubious decisions under pressure. We also need an evaluation of the existing system. I hope that we will very soon receive facts, figures and data that reveal how successful the existing system has been in practice. Has the existing system really facilitated trade for the States that benefit from it? Have the export figures also risen? Are the right countries benefiting from this system? I will throw this question out to everyone here: is everything in order with the existing system? For example, if countries like Qatar, whose per capita income is hi", "Council Question Time\nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B6-0018/2007).\nThe following questions are addressed to the Council.\nSubject: Political crisis in Turkey and prospects of accession\nIn the last few days, in connection with the appointment of the President of the Republic, Turkey has fallen into a deep political crisis which gives rise to serious doubts about the functioning of its democratic institutions. The country's Constitutional Court has annulled the first round of the elections, a decision vigorously contested by the government. The Prime Minister has stated that the parliamentary system has been brought to a halt and he is calling for early elections, while the General Army Staff has issued a warning that it will intervene to prevent the election of the Islamist, Abdullah G\u00fcl, to the office of President.\nWhat are the Council's views on this situation in a candidate country for accession to the EU? Does it share the opinion of the Commissioner responsible for enlargement, Mr Olli Rehn, that the armed forces should respect the independent role of the democratic process, that the EU is based on the principles of freedom, democracy, the rule of law and the sovereignty of political forces vis-\u00e0-vis the military, and his insistence that any country seeking accession to the EU must respect those principles, which are the key elements of the Copenhagen criteria? What impact does it believe such interventions by the military could have on the country's accession procedure? Does the Council have direct contacts with leading political figures in Turkey and what is their reaction?\nG\u00fcnter Gloser\nMadam President, we are following developments in Turkey with close attention, and I would also like to remind the House of the Presidency's statement on 28 April of this year, in which we emphasised the need for the presidential elections to be conducted in line with the principles of democracy and the rule of law laid down in the constitution.\nGenerally speaking, ", "Energy statistics (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Turmes, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on energy statistics - C6-0035/2007 -.\nJoaqu\u00edn Almunia\nMember of the Commission. - (ES) Madam President, last year was a year of crucial decisions on climate change and energy policy. The European Union is determined, and committed to tackling climate change and taking up the challenge of guaranteeing secure, sustainable and competitive energy.\nThe European Council of March 2007, a year ago, established precise and binding objectives, with an ambitious plan to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and increase the use of renewable energy in our energy consumption.\nThe Commission, as you know, has put forward specific proposals in these areas. All of these aspirations require high-quality, constant and detailed monitoring of the progress of our energy situation, as energy consumption is responsible for more than 80% of our greenhouse gas emissions. Member States also need to monitor their energy dependency closely, in particular with regard to natural gas and oil. The proposal for a regulation on energy statistics is part of the energy package adopted by the Commission last year.\nTraditionally, gathering statistics on energy has been based on voluntary agreements with the Member States, and it has been done in this way for years. Nevertheless, both the Commission and Parliament agree that, now and in the future, this gathering of statistics is too important to depend solely on voluntary agreements. Moreover, the liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets has brought with it an increase in the number of interested parties, with the logical consequence that gathering data in this field is now much more complex, which means that a legal basis is needed for this very important work.\nThis proposal for a regulation is the result of a request from the ", "Multi-annual recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the proposal for a Council regulation concerning a multi-annual recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean - C6-0081/2009 -.\nPhilippe Morillon\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament's decision to accept the Council's request for application of the urgent procedure for this matter was a unanimous one, both in the Committee on Fisheries last week and here in plenary this morning.\nWe are, of course, all aware of the need for the European Union to honour the commitments made in Marrakesh last November by the competent international commission, the ICCAT. We need, specifically, to put into practice the recommendations that this organisation adopted in order to curb the persistent problem of overfishing of bluefin tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean and to confront the resultant serious risk to the future of the species and thus to the fishing industry itself.\nTwo of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries, Mrs Fraga Est\u00e9vez and Mr Romeva i Rueda, were in Marrakesh and will be talking about this during the debate. For my part, I would like to remind you that our committee attaches great importance to this matter, which brings into play the main aspects of the common fisheries policy: resource management, fleet management, respect for international, regional and bilateral agreements, technical measures and, above all, monitoring, to which I will return shortly. This defining issue is thus, in our view, a test of the credibility of the common fisheries policy.\nFor this reason, there was obviously no question of the new recovery plan being implemented without consulting the European Parliament.\nI am therefore delighted that the Commission ultimately chose the only legally and politically acceptable route for implementing the ICCAT's recommendations, namely, submitting a prop", "12.

If not, we will vote against it and I can then withdraw my amendment 23.\n- Before the vote on paragraph 34\nIeke van den Burg \nrapporteur. - I should simply like to add 'group' to paragraph 34, so that it is the 'European Investment Bank Group' instead of just the bank.\n(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)\n", "Green Paper on the European Workforce for Health (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Green Paper on the European Workforce for Health.\nAndroulla Vassiliou\nMember of the Commission. - Madam President, I am very pleased to have been invited to make a statement to Parliament on the Green Paper on the EU Workforce for Health, adopted by the Commission on 10 December 2008.\nThat invitation comes at an opportune moment, as we are now approaching the end of the consultation phase, which will be closed at the end of this month.\nIt is clear that there are growing pressures on all EU health systems arising from an ageing population, health threats, as well as the rising cost of new technologies and patients' increased expectations - and all this against the background of a difficult economic situation.\nWithout a well-trained and motivated health workforce throughout the EU, the financial sustainability of European health systems will be threatened and health inequalities will increase.\nAs the European population gets older, so does its health workforce, and there are insufficient new recruits coming through to replace those who leave. We need to reflect on the reasons why young people are not motivated to become health workers.\nThis, coupled with the mobility of health professionals within and between Member States is creating common health workforce problems for most European health systems.\nI expect a large number of responses to the Green Paper from the many stakeholder organisations in the field of health that have expressed concerns about this important issue.\nI also look forward to receiving contributions from the members of this Parliament.

Please listen carefully and free from any fear: 'whereas the' Russian 'public is not sufficiently informed about the extent of the crimes committed in the' Second World War, 'most notably in' Finland, the Baltic States, Katy\u0144 and the K\u00f6nigsberg region; Parliament 'believes that the citizens of' Russia 'are entitled to be told the truth about the ... policies of war and genocide committed in their name and to have knowledge of the perpetrators of war crimes'; Parliament 'believes that' Russia 'must honestly confront its' Soviet 'past in order to progress and that coming to terms with the past is an integral part of the road to reconciliation with' Russia's 'neighbours'.\nIt was, indeed, addressed by our Parliament - to Serbia, which appreciated our suggestions, but, as this House does not exercise double standards, the same forms of encouragement are to be used in our documents regarding Russia.\nL\u00edvia J\u00e1r\u00f3ka\n(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, I would like to say a few words about the situation of European Roma, in connection with our opinion, which was adopted at the last plenary session. I feel it is essential that the European Commission and the Parliament should work side by side and take responsibility for this minority, assuming a much more emphatic role than they have done up to now, and preparing, implementing and monitoring programmes aimed at the inclusion of social groups that have been excluded and marginalised. As part of this, it would be very important for the Members of the European Parliament work side by side with the Commissioners who are directly or indirectly responsible for minorities, ", "Equality between women and men in the European Union - 2009 (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Marc Tarabella, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on equality between women and men in the European Union - 2009 -.\nMarc Tarabella\nMadam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I wish to congratulate the European Commission on its excellent report. In fact, this report on equality between women and men, which we vote on each year, has special resonance for me. It is the first report that I have presented within the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, of which I am an active member. Moreover, it is a report that is absolutely essential this year given the economic, social and financial crisis that the European Union especially is going through.\nThis is why I have been keen to stress, in my report, the impact of the crisis on women. First of all by observing that men suffered more redundancies at the start of the crisis - that is to be expected given the impact on heavy industry, in particular - but recent months have seen unemployment of both women and men grow in the same way and at the same rate.\nMoreover, in a good dozen Member States, the unemployment rate remains higher for women, and women are over-represented in part-time employment. I therefore call on the Commission and the Member States to supply accurate statistics on the impact of the crisis on women and men, and on the Member States, before they implement any budget austerity policies, to carry out gender-based impact studies so as to prevent women from being disproportionately affected.\nThe fight to eliminate violence against women is also, in my opinion, an important point. Twenty to twenty-five per cent of European women suffer physical violence during their adult life, that is a fact, but 10% of them are also victims of sexual violence. I believe therefore that men must also make a commitment to combat violence against women.\nThe Spanish Pr", "i2010: Digital libraries (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Descamps, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on i2010: Digital libraries.\nOnce again, more than 50 per cent of the speakers in this debate are women, the first of which is Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Descamps, the rapporteur.\nMarie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Descamps\nrapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the idea of a European digital library originated from six EU Heads of State and Government who wanted to allow universal access to the European cultural heritage and to preserve it for future generations. This federal project for Europe will strengthen the expression of a true European identity and help spread our cultural and linguistic diversity across the world. The project, which is without precedent for Europe, combines the past with the present and links the cultural with the digital dimension. It is the perfect response to the various issues now affecting our fellow citizens in the form of new information and communication technologies. The Internet, which is the third favourite medium of Europe's young people, is in effect one of the main means of access to knowledge and learning.\nWhile some real progress has been made, the digitisation of our cultural resources and their bringing online nevertheless remains very fragmented and relies on the various mechanisms that have been put in place by the Member States. If they are to be effective and reach the greatest number of people the initiatives for promoting and disseminating our cultural heritage need to be well coordinated. This is the intended objective of the European digital library, which the Commission is supporting through its beacon initiative 'i2010 digital libraries'.\nThe first part of this initiative, namely the communication of 30 September 2005, was based on three main aspects: digitisation, online access and preservation of digital content. The Commission has set out to analyse the main technic", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of Tuesday, 10 March 1998 have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nCarnero Gonz\u00e1lez\nGood morning, Mr President. I am sure you will be kind enough to let me make a remark.\nAs I am sure we are all aware, today is a sad and ignominious day for all those people in the world who believe in democracy. General Augusto Pinochet, who was responsible for one of the most brutal dictatorships ever known, and for the death and disappearance of thousands of people, both from his own country and of European origin, is today attempting to become a life senator. The democrats in that country are protesting loudly at that regrettable state of affairs. I believe this Parliament should do so too, especially in view of the motion we adopted during topical and urgent debate during our last part-session, which says in paragraph 1: \"disapproves strongly of General Pinochet's intention to take office as life senator' .\nMr President, that would be a worthy gesture, and I request it of you before the House.\n\nPresident\nMr Carnero Gonz\u00e1lez, the very applause of this House amounts to a second ratification of that motion, which expresses a view shared by all honest men and women. So I do not think there is any need for rhetoric.\n\nGuti\u00e9rrez D\u00edaz\nMr President, on page 26 of the Minutes, where it refers to Question Time, it says, \"Parliament considered a number of questions to the Commission' . It fails to mention that, because Question Time started 35 minutes later than stated in the agenda, the Chair apologized to the Members and the Commission representatives.\nMr President, I should like the Minutes to record that the first words from the Chair were an apology for that delay.\n\nPresident\nThank you, Mr Guti\u00e9rrez D\u00edaz. The fact that you apologized will be added to the Minutes.\n\nSindal\nMr President, this is the first time I have taken this opportunity to raise a problem.

There are 31 Members on the list, although many or, at least, some of them are not present. This is not a catch-the-eye procedure, but instead we have a list of speakers who have asked to make one-minute speeches.\nDrago\u015f Florin David\n(RO) In November the European Commission presented its 2008 report on the Republic of Macedonia. This report emphasises the progress that has been made during the past year, but does not provide a specific date for initiating accession negotiations.\nI believe that the progress which has been made in the areas of the economy, administrative reform and judicial reform, along with the current situation in the Western Balkans, entitles the Republic of Macedonia to hope that a date will be set for initiating accession negotiations in 2009. This is subject to the parliament and government of the Republic of Macedonia undertaking more sustained and responsible efforts to create a climate of democracy in order to ensure transparent, democratic conditions for the local and presidential elections due to take place in March 2009.\nAt the same time, I would like to call on the European Commission to bear in mind the progress that has been made by the Republic of Macedonia over the last few years, as well as the responsibilities assumed by the parliament and government of the Republic of Macedonia. It should also draw up an action plan for lifting the visa requirements for citizens from the Republic of Macedonia ...\n(The President cut off the speaker)\nMarusya Ivanova Lyubcheva\n(BG) I would like to draw attention to the sanctioning of Bulgaria by the Directorate General for Enlargement on the withdrawal of accreditation for two agencies that have been entitled to resources from the pre-accession funds of the EU.

This was sent to me through AKI International specifically to coincide with the debate on the World day against the death penalty.\nHere is the extract: 'We would like to thank you for your efforts and the attention that you have given to the case of our mother Sakineh. We would first like to ask for your moral support. Our only hope remains the international community and, for this reason, we would like to ask the European Parliament to intervene in a decisive fashion with all the instruments that it has available to it, to help our mother. We beg you not to abandon us and to listen to our request for help. Lastly, in the hope that primitive punishments, such as stoning and hanging, will be eliminated for ever throughout the world, we send you our warmest greetings.'\nOlivier Chastel\nMadam President, ladies and gentlemen, as the President has just said, I speak before this House on the World Day and also the European Day against the Death Penalty on behalf of the high representative, Baroness Ashton.\nAs you know, the picture of the use of the death penalty in the world is still a mixed one. On the one hand, the vast majority of states today are in favour of its abolition, either in law or in practice, and it is encouraging to see that the number of such states continues to grow. Indeed, we are seeing a strong tendency towards abolition and the restriction of capital punishment in most countries.\nOn the other hand, the number of executions and the procedures in place for using the death penalty around the world are unfortunately alarming: the 5 679 executions reported in 2009 were 5 679 ex", "13. Transatlantic relations (vote) \n- Motion for a resolution\n- Before the vote on paragraph 13\nSophia in 't Veld\nMr President, I would like to propose the following changes to paragraph 13. Firstly, that the word 'welcomes' be replaced by the word 'notes'. Secondly, that we add at the end: 'regrets, however, the lack of democratic oversight due to the exclusion of the European Parliament and national parliaments from this dialogue'. Finally, we also propose deletion of the word 'political' before 'framework'.\nJos\u00e9 Ignacio Salafranca S\u00e1nchez-Neyra\n(ES) Mr President, I simply wish to say that my group would agree with two of the references: that of changing the word 'Welcomes' to 'Notes' and the removal of the word 'political'.\nIn order to be able to agree to this proposal, however, we would like to add a positive note and say: 'so as to give greater democratic legitimacy to this dialogue, calls for the European Parliament to be involved'.\nSophia in 't Veld\nMr President, I think that is acceptable.\n(The oral amendments were accepted)\n", "Progress made on resettling Guant\u00e1namo detainees and on closing Guant\u00e1namo (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on progress made on resettling Guant\u00e1namo detainees and on closing Guant\u00e1namo.\nDiego L\u00f3pez Garrido\nMadam President, as you know, the European Union welcomed the promise made by President Obama to close the Guant\u00e1namo detention centre. He made the promise in his inauguration speech, and this was later endorsed by a joint declaration of the European Union and its Member States with the United States on 15 June last year.\nWe are in favour of the law being applied and human rights being respected at all times, and in this declaration, the United States of course agreed. This therefore seemed to be incompatible with maintaining the Guant\u00e1namo detention centre, which had also become one of the pretexts for propaganda most frequently used by al-Qaeda.\nIt is true that the timescale that was planned for closing it - one year - has now passed. It is true, however, that there are difficulties, and we can give some examples, such as former prisoners in Yemen not being able to return there immediately. We are also finding that this issue is very controversial in the United States, although we welcome the fact that President Obama is persevering with his intention to close Guant\u00e1namo despite the strong opposition that he is facing in Congress, not only among the Republicans but also among the Democrats.\nHowever, in any case, some prisoners have now left Guant\u00e1namo and are going to be tried in ordinary US courts, such as, for example, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged brains behind the 11 September attacks, despite the concern that this generated in the United States.\nWe have therefore always been clear about our position in our contacts with the United States as well as recently, in the visit to Brussels by the United States' special envoy on this issue, Daniel Fried, who was formerly responsible for relations between the United S", "Situation in Ukraine (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission on the situation in Ukraine.\n\u0160tefan F\u00fcle\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission, Cathy Ashton, asked me to make the following remarks.\nAllow me to thank you for this very timely invitation to address you on Ukraine, which is a key partner for the European Union.\nAs you will be aware, a second round of presidential elections took place on Sunday in Ukraine. This was an important event, not just for the country itself, but for the wider region as a whole. It is important because a democratic Ukraine will serve as an important example to its neighbours.\nWe welcome the positive assessment made by the OSCE/ODIHR-led International Election Observation Mission that the elections were conducted in accordance with international standards and that there has been further progress in Ukraine's already good electoral track-record since 2004.\nThe statement issued by the High Representative on Monday expressed this sentiment. It also congratulated the people of Ukraine for their continued commitment to the democratic process. The high turnout on both election days was particularly encouraging.\nIt is clear that Ukraine's democracy is continuing its process of consolidation. The population of the country goes to the polls, makes its choice freely, and expects to be heard. This is a significant achievement. Most importantly, it demonstrates Ukraine's attachment to European values.\nElections have winners and losers. It is the electorate who decides. As we meet here today in Strasbourg, official election results have not yet been certified by the Central Election Commission.\nPreliminary election results show a very small gap between the two contestants. We have already heard about possible challenges to the results in the courts. Some lo", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nTunne Kelam\nMr President, I voted against the resolution concerning Lithuania because I found this resolution to be a premature and unbalanced reaction to a law that has not yet even entered into force, let alone in its original wording.\nIt is true that human rights fall within the competence of the Union. However, in this case the Union comes very close to infringing the principle of sovereignty of a Member State, and that is why I have opposed this resolution, also bearing in mind that it would have a negative result on the Irish referendum as a bad example of how the sovereignty of the Member States could be treated.\nBogus\u0142aw Sonik\n(PL) Mr President, I voted against this resolution because Lithuania will be able to deal with the problem on its own. The Lithuanian President has created a special group to review this legislation, which is only supposed to come into force in 2010. Moreover, I think that the resolution would constitute an excessive amount of interference in the affairs of a sovereign nation such as Lithuania. Furthermore, this resolution contains a statement to the effect that the legal opinion of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights should be requested. It does not fall within the remit of the Agency for Fundamental Rights to evaluate individual countries and draw up an opinion on such cases. It would set far too dangerous a precedent.\nBernd Posselt\n(DE) Mr President, I am an enthusiastic pro-European and advocate of a European constitution as well as the Treaty of Lisbon. I am also a fighter for human rights. However, this resolution inflicts a lot of damage on Europe, particularly in the run-up to the Irish referendum, and it misuses the issue of human rights for ideological purposes. The Lithuanian law has nothing to do with human rights, but if anything it actually protects the human rights of Lithuanian children rather than violating them. I therefore consider this resolution to be an i", "\n\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The next item is the oral question to the Commission (O-0036/2005 - B6-0168/2005) by Mr\u00a0Sifunakis, on combating doping in sport. \nSifunakis (PSE ),\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today's oral question and the related motion for a resolution by the Committee on Culture and Education on combating doping in sport follows on from extended efforts by the European Parliament.\nI would merely remind you that the first initiative by the European Parliament on doping was the resolution of 7\u00a0September 2000 on the Commission communication on a Community support plan to combat doping in sport and that the last major initiative was the public hearing organised by our committee just last November, entitled 'Drug-taking in sport: obstacle to the ideal of athleticism', at which a large number of invited experts gave their views.\nThis public hearing was held after the Olympic Games in Athens, which demonstrated once again that doping in sport continues, unfortunately, to be a real and worsening phenomenon. It is worth noting that we had 22 incidents of athletes who tested positive during doping controls at the Athens Olympics, which was twice the number at Sidney.\nToday's oral question relating to the motion for a resolution is the result of these previous initiatives and of the acute concern in our committee about the proportions which doping has taken on today in a bid to increase athletic performances.\nThe problem is two-fold.\nOn the one hand, doping is contrary to the ideals of athleticism, as put forward in the Olympic Charter on sport. The spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play \u2013 in other words all the values which make sport a social, cultural and educational activity \u2013 are obviously irreconcilable with doping, the aims of which are to cheat and to acquire riches and fifteen minutes of fame.\nOn the other hand, doping is dangerous to the health of the athletes who take recourse to banned substances, often in knowledge of the inherent dangers.", "European Microfinance Facility for Employment and Social Inclusion (Progress) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs G\u00f6ncz, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on establishing a European Microfinance Facility for Employment and Social Inclusion (Progress Microfinance Facility) - C7-0053/2009 -.\nPervenche Ber\u00e8s\n(FR) Madam President, I note that, throughout the previous debate, you referred to the debate that is now to take place as a debate on Progress.\nHowever, the decision of this Parliament, confirmed by the Conference of Presidents, is that we will only vote on the 'microfinance' facility. I therefore think that this clarification is an important one. This is a debate on microfinance and not on the Progress programme.\nKinga G\u00f6ncz\nThank you very much, Madam President, and I am also very grateful for this clarification, as it is vitally important that we are now going to talk about the microfinance facility. I would also like to welcome Commissioner \u0160pidla to the following debate. Let me begin by saying that when I became rapporteur for this programme, I thought that I would have a very easy job, given the wide-ranging consensus and support on this issue, something which was also in evidence during the debate. This support was wide-ranging in many respects. On the one hand, as a crisis management facility, it will also help precisely those who are in the most desperate situation, who have lost their job and who cannot access credit or assistance either due to the financial crisis.\nOn the other hand, this is typically a facility which does not provide people with fish, but teaches them how to fish. It triggers precisely the type of creativity which we need most from the point of view of ensuring a positive outcome to the crisis. The third aspect which received, and still receives, wide-ranging support is the fact that the European Union's resources a", "Preparation for the EU/Latin America Summit (Madrid, 17/18 May 2002)\nPresident.\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on the preparation for the EU/Latin America Summit, which is to be held in Madrid on 17 and 18 May 2002.\n\nde Miguel\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, in June 1999 the first Summit of Heads of State and Government between the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean took place in R\u00edo de Janeiro on the initiative of France and Spain. During this Summit, Spain offered to host a second one which was agreed at the time, and which furthermore would coincide with the Spanish Presidency of the European Union.\nTherefore, as planned, the Summit will take place in Madrid on the 17th and 18th of this month, that is, on Friday and Saturday of this week.\nThe profound changes which took place in European and in the Americas during the 90s and the mutual desire to establish a general framework for bi-regional relations were the prime motives for staging the R\u00edo Summit. At the end of that Summit, the Heads of State and Government adopted two important documents: the R\u00edo Declaration, which established the general principles to be applied to relations between Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean and a second document, designated as an Action Plan, which identified the 55 priority areas in the political, economic, cultural, educational and social fields, amongst others, which should form the basis for a strategic bi-regional partnership between the two sides of the Atlantic.\nThrough this Madrid Summit, the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean are committing themselves to deepening this partnership so that both regions can together confront the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities offered by the new 21st Century.\nIn Madrid, the Heads of State and Government propose to adopt three documents: an evaluation report recording what has been achieved since the Rio Summit, a document presenting the increasingly numerous commo", "Outcome of the Climate Change Conference in Canc\u00fan (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on the outcome of the Climate Change Conference in Canc\u00fan.\nJoke Schauvliege\nMr President, honourable members of Parliament, I am very pleased to be here today, in the European Parliament, once again, after the debate we had prior to Canc\u00fan and now that the climate conference has produced an outcome.\nI am also pleased to see a few familiar faces here again who were also present as a delegation in Canc\u00fan and who were given a mandate by the European Parliament to make a very useful and active contribution to the success of the conference. I think that this should definitely be highlighted and underlined.\nThe climate summit in Canc\u00fan has ultimately been a success. It was uncertain, right up to the very last day, whether we would reach an outcome, but, in the end, that outcome has been a positive one. This was necessary, both for our climate policy and for the continued existence of the multilateral process.\nAt the climate conference, we reached a decision which actually consisted of two parts: the first part could be considered to consist of a number of specific measures which could be applied quite rapidly, and the second part lays down a number of foundations intended to facilitate a global deal for the post-2012 period over the long term. Obviously, both of these elements were agreed in the framework of the 2 \u00b0C target, which was included as the starting point in the outcome of the climate conference.\nWhen I speak about immediate implementation or a number of actions which could be undertaken immediately, then I am talking about adaptation, technology, combating deforestation and financing. Perhaps I could briefly highlight a number of things?\nFirst and foremost, adaptation. We have adopted a framework and established a committee. In that way, we will be offering support for the most vulnerable areas.\nSecondly, technology.

The day is dedicated to more than 5 000 victims of terrorism in Europe. Terrorists declare war against civilians. They strike in places where ordinary people should feel safe in their countries. It is shameful, deceitful and cowardly. That is why terrorism can never be justified. We Europeans are strong and united.

It is a report in which our committee has dwelt not so much on the history of how we got here, but on the simple comparison of whether this new Treaty improves the European Union compared to the current Treaties, whether the Treaties as amended by the Treaty of Lisbon make the European Union more effective, more democratic and better for its citizens. That is what we have done, and our conclusion is clear.\nFirstly, on democratic accountability: this Union will have a system whereby any legislation in the future will be subject to the prior scrutiny of national parliaments and then the double approval of the Council of Ministers, composed of ministers accountable to those very same national parliaments, and the European Parliament, directly elected by citizens to represent them at European level. That is a level of scrutiny that exists in no other international structure. You can look at the WTO, the World Bank, the IMF, NATO - nothing above the level of the nation state has that in-built degree of parliamentary scrutiny that we will have with this new Treaty.\nThe new Treaty also improves the powers of the European Parliament in other respects. We will elect the President of the Commission and we will have full power over the whole of the European budget, together with the Council, no longer seeing agricultural expenditure ring-fenced from parliamentary scrutiny. Parliament will have the right to block Commission implementing measures where we disagree with them. Parliament will have the right to repeal the delegation of powers to the Commission if we feel that is necessary. I see the Commissioner is already looking w", "1. Adaption of Title IV of the EC Treaty - Court of Justice (vote) \n- Sz\u00e1jer report\n- Before the vote\nJ\u00f3zsef Sz\u00e1jer \nrapporteur. - (HU) The European Parliament is duty bound to provide for European citizens' legal protection. Here in the EP, there is widespread support for the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, which would be a great step forward from the point of view of the Court's jurisdiction. Nevertheless, we are in the fortunate position of not having to wait in this matter for the birth of the Constitutional Treaty, as the Treaty of Amsterdam provides for a transition, a 'passerelle'.\nThe report I have tabled clearly advocates implementing the transition, or 'passerelle', extending thereby the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice to matters concerning the European visa, as well as to refugee and immigration policies. This guarantees total legal protection for European citizens. My proposal would thus make it possible to strengthen European legal safeguards with regard to fundamental rights. In this way I wish to facilitate the uniform interpretation and application of Community rules and laws, and the creation of a unified system of legal safeguards. This is not the first time Parliament calls upon the Council to speed up the adoption of this transitional clause, the 'passerelle', in order to remove the limitations on the Court's competence with regard to Article 4 of the Treaty. I ask Parliament to support my proposal.\n", "2006 Annual report of the EIB (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Jean-Pierre Audy on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control on the European Investment Bank's annual report for 2006.\nJean-Pierre Audy\nrapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, President of the European Investment Bank, ladies and gentlemen, my first words will be to thank you, Mr Maystadt, for the excellent relationship you have built up with the MEPs on the Committee on Budgetary Control, which has made a significant contribution to enabling the report we are about to debate to be written. I would extend these thanks to your team of staff, and especially, Philippe de Fontaine Vive, Vice-President, with whom I was able to work in complete transparency at the Bank's headquarters in Luxembourg.\nYou carry out your role, Mr Maystadt, with a great deal of competence, warmth, determination and courage, but also with wisdom and, I would add, with elegance.\nThe EIB, which was set up by the Treaty of Rome, celebrates its fiftieth anniversary in 2008. Its members are the European Union Member States, and their finance ministers form its board of governors. Its mission is to contribute to the development of the common market, using the capital markets and its own funds. It is a Community instrument, but within it power is exercised intergovernmentally.\nIt is a good thing that citizens' representatives are talking about these issues at a time when citizens themselves are demanding results from the European Union; they often benefit from the EIB's services without realising it. First I would like to congratulate the Bank for its action, its ambitious plan of activities and projects; I particularly welcome the excellence of the new strategy for 2007-2009 including transparency, the reinforcement of added value and the gradual increase in risk-taking, activities for the benefit of SMEs and local government, the use of new financial instruments and the stepping-up of cooperation with the Eur", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe minutes of yesterday's meeting have been distributed.

I can say to you, Mr Janssen van Raay, that the Bureau has already looked at this question, and believes it was a very serious one. The President and the Bureau have decided that Ms McKenna would receive a letter from the President in which the President would express to Ms McKenna his surprise and consternation. If, as we have every reason to believe, she has accused officials of this parliament without proof, of course the necessary follow-up action to these serious accusations will take place.

(PT) Mr President, honourable Members, I welcome the opportunity to speak here about Pakistan, undoubtedly a very important country which, as it happens, does not always receive the attention it deserves. I know that some of the honourable Members consider relations with Pakistan to be of particular interest, so I am delighted to be able to set out the Council's position on the country and hear your opinions.\nThe situation in Pakistan is developing rapidly in the run up to the elections and we hope that cooperation with the European Parliament will remain good over the coming months. The EU a long history of relations with Pakistan, dating back to 1976 when our first cooperation agreement was set up.\nUnfortunately, for a number of reasons lasting recent years, relations have not been as close as either side would have liked. It was for this reason that in 2005 the EU embarked upon a review of its policy towards Pakistan, since the Council recognised that certain issues in the country were posing challenges. It was also firmly agreed that the only effective policy would be resolutely to maintain regular contact with the Pakistani government. From this decision came the joint EU-Pakistan declaration, adopted in Berlin on 8 February. Thus, our political dialogue was formalised and the way was open to implement the 2004 cooperation agreement, also known as a third generation agreement, in full.\nAs a result, relations between the EU and Pakistan have been operating on a new footing since the beginning of this year. It is our hope that this will contribute towards better understanding between the two sides. This is a step forward in a long-term process to establish cooperation that we hope will be fruitful. It is also an acknowledgment of the importance that the EU ascribes to Pakistan as a p", "Welcome\nPresident\nIt gives me great pleasure to welcome a delegation of Members of the Majlisi Oli, the Parliament of the Republic of Tajikistan, who have taken their seats in the official gallery.\n(Applause)\nThe members of the delegation have come to Strasbourg for talks with their European counterparts in the framework of the third interparliamentary meeting between the European Parliament and the Majlisi Oli. This is the first time that the interparliamentary meeting has taken place here in Strasbourg.\nMr Makhkamboy Azimovich Makhmudov, who is leading the delegation, is accompanied by Mr Nosir Yusupovich Salimov and Mr Gulkhoja Gangibekov.\nI hope that the delegation will continue to enjoy a pleasant and successful stay in the European Union.\n(Applause)\n", "Council's approach to revision of OLAF regulation (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council by Mrs Gr\u00e4\u00dfle, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the Council's approach to revision of the OLAF regulation - B6-0492/2008).\nIngeborg Gr\u00e4\u00dfle\nauthor. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur on OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, one makes interesting discoveries, for example, that everyone talks about combating fraud but no one does anything. Another discovery is that Member States work out all their payments to the European Union to the last cent, but when it comes to spending this money, they start feeling generous and even make it easier for fraudsters, for example, by still taking an average of 36 months to even report irregularities to the European Union. The European Parliament considers this unacceptable. We want to see an effective fight against fraud, one that includes prevention. We want Member States to put the fight against fraud on the agenda and we want to see a joint discussion about what we need and what the problems are.\nWe want to see the national judicial authorities taking a greater interest in following up the results of OLAF investigations. There must be an end to the legal loopholes that have existed up to now for fiddles. We need European funds to be treated in the same way as national funds. We want an independent office with the resources and legal bases necessary to perform its tasks. We want an office that can work together with Member States quietly and efficiently.\nOur opinion on the legal basis, Regulation 1073/99, covers all these points. Our plea is for this Regulation - which is at the heart of OLAF - to be further developed together with the Council. We call on the Council to incorporate our opinion and open talks on the further development of this Regulation. We want to provide a solution to OLAF's problems.\nI wish", "The mandate of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the report by Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the mandate of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.\nAnnemie Neyts-Uyttebroeck\nrapporteur. - (NL) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, since its inception in 1993, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has indicted 161 people. Proceedings have been fully concluded against 116 of them, while for a number of other defendants, the criminal procedure is still in progress.\nProceedings are yet to start in two cases only, while two main defendants, Messrs Mladi\u0107 and Had\u017ei\u0107, are still on the run. Although the UN Security Council has asked the Tribunal to wind up its activities by no later than the end of 2010, it has left some room for manoeuvre.\nAfter an understandably difficult start - after all, everything was new and had to be invented on the spot, as it were - the Tribunal has turned out to be a very sound, serious and capable legal body that does not limit its activities to administering justice, which, by the way, it does with the greatest care, something which has boosted its legitimacy. In addition, the Tribunal has set up proper outreach programmes to contribute to the assimilation and reconciliation process in the countries that came into being after the former Yugoslavia collapsed.\nThe Tribunal also helps train national legal bodies which, after all, have to handle the lion's share of the dossiers on war crimes and crimes against humanity. Indeed, it was never the intention for the Tribunal to step into the shoes of national courts across the former Yugoslavia on a permanent basis.\nQuite the reverse. It is the countries in question that have to ensure that the war crimes and crime", "Cross-border cooperation to combat terrorism and cross-border crime (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by B\u00e1rbara D\u00fchrkop D\u00fchrkop, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany with a view to the adoption of a Council Decision on the implementation of Decision 2007/.../JHA on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime (11563/2007 - C6-0409/2007 -.\nB\u00e1rbara D\u00fchrkop D\u00fchrkop\nrapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, the report which we have produced for debate and approval today embodies a 2005 initiative, in which the seven Member States decided to step up cross-border cooperation in all areas relating to terrorism, organised crime and illegal immigration.\nThe German Presidency proposed incorporating part of this agreement in the Community acquis by means of a framework decision, that is to say under the third pillar, on the lines of what was done with the Schengen Agreement, leaving aside, however, the matter of illegal immigration which, according to the Tampere mandate, should come under the third pillar.\nIt is therefore regrettable that clear Community powers were not included in the international treaty, since this not only creates judicial confusion, but leaves us with two legal frameworks of reference.\nThe first was negotiated in a less than transparent manner. National parliaments were not consulted, nor was the European Parliament. We were only consulted at the last minute, in haste and in a non-binding manner as the instrument was about to be incorporated into the Community acquis.\nThe report of our unfortunate fellow Member Fausto Correia sets out the position of the European Parliament on this matter.\nToday we are pleased to be able to say that the Council consultation is being presented on the basis of the codecision procedure. This is a consultation which does not confine itself to the agreement itself but includ", "G20 labour and employment ministers meeting (Washington, 20/21 April) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the G20 labour and employment ministers meeting (Washington, 20/21 April).\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Andor\nMember of the Commission. - Madam President, the latest projections from the ILO and the OECD show that unemployment rates in the industrialised countries are still rising and will not reach their climax before 2011.\nIn turn, more than 200 million workers in developing and emerging countries are at risk of being pushed into extreme poverty. This would result in nearly 1.5 billion working poor worldwide. These figures speak for themselves. Indeed, the current crisis highlighted the most painful weaknesses of our increasingly interconnected global economy. There is now a clear consensus on the need for global actions to solve global problems.\nLast year in Pittsburgh, leaders of the G20 pledged to ensure that when growth returns, jobs do too. Accordingly, the G20 leaders agreed to build an employment-oriented framework for future economic growth.\nThis is all very welcome. The Commission lends full support to any framework for actions that put quality jobs at the heart of recovery and help people back to work worldwide. This approach reflects the unmistakable reality that employment is the bottom line in the current global economic crisis, and that a jobless recovery is not an option.\nIn Pittsburgh, the leaders invited the US Labour Secretary to convene a meeting of G20 labour and employment ministers. Their mandate will be to assess the global employment situation and discuss the impact of policy responses to the crisis as well as the possible necessity of any further measures. Moreover, ministers are to consider medium-term employment and skills development policies, social protection programmes and best practices to ensure workers can benefit from advances in science and technology. This unprecedented meeting will take place in Washington DC on 20 ", "Conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of highly qualified employment - Single application procedure for residence and work\nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following reports:\nby Mrs E. Klamt, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of highly qualified employment - C6-0011/2008 -;\nby Mr P. Gaubert, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive on a single application procedure for a single permit for third-country nationals to reside and work in the territory of a Member State and on a common set of rights for third-country workers legally residing in a Member State - C6-0470/2007 -.\nThe House services tell me that Mrs Klamt's father has died and she is therefore not present. Naturally, we send our condolences to Mrs Klamt and thank Mr Weber for assuming the responsibility of acting as rapporteur in this debate.\nManfred Weber\nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President, the reason why I am speaking today has already been mentioned. This is because Mrs Klamt has had a close family bereavement. We would like to convey our condolences to her.\nI would like to start by expressing my gratitude on behalf of the rapporteur for the excellent cooperation in this area. As you know, the report has been produced in close cooperation between the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs of the European Parliament, as part of the process for increasing collaboration. For this reason, I would like to thank the fellow Members who were involved and also the shadow rapporteurs on the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. The rapporteur would also like to thank in particular the French Presidency, with which she has had c", "Violent video games (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on violent videogames.\nFranco Frattini\nVice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am particularly grateful to the few, perhaps less than ten, Members present in this Chamber to debate a subject that affects many tens of millions of young and very young people - our children - in the European Union.\nThe protection of the law and of the fundamental rights of young people and children must remain a major priority for the EU. It is a priority for the European Commission, and I have to say quite frankly that the acts of violence and sadism that appear in some particularly bloody videogames are a cause of great concern to us.\nNew technologies that have enabled young and very young people to use the Internet and technological games have changed the relationship between adults and children. Young people, our children, are often much more familiar with these technologies than adults are. What is essential, therefore, is primarily greater responsibility and consciousness on the part of adults and parents, as well as focus and education to make parents, above all, fully aware of the risks and able to make informed decisions.\nThere is a classification system with labelling for the content of films, and also for games and videogames, that may be of use. This must, of course, be combined with a mechanism providing for more effective education. These components are necessary if we want a solution that works.\nThe European Union already has instruments for fighting these worrying problems within the policy areas of justice and security, and also the information society and internal market rules.\nI must say quite sincerely, ladies and gentlemen, that I have also been highly impressed by certain child protection monitoring and enhancement initiatives that I was informed about by some Home Affairs Ministers before and after the Council of Ministers, and which have been ", "Announcements by the President\nPresident\nTo begin with, I would like to inform you briefly of four matters. It was with great satisfaction that I learned that Mr Liu Xiaobo had received the Nobel Peace Prize. This champion of human rights is still in jail as a result of his peaceful activity for freedom of speech in China. We appreciate the Chinese authorities' latest efforts on the path to attaining the political, economic and social standards of the free world. However, these are still not enough, and so we are redoubling our calls for the release of Liu Xiaobo, Hu Jia, winner of the Sakharov Prize, and other defenders of human rights from prison. The European Parliament will stand as a permanent guard upholding human rights.\nSecondly, this week, the European Parliament is organising a series of events linked with yesterday's International Day for the Eradication of Poverty Many of us are wearing badges relating to this. In addition to plenary debates devoted to this subject, I would like to invite you to take part in a ceremony at Bronis\u0142aw Geremek Agora tomorrow at 14:45, in which UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon will be taking part.\nThirdly, today, for the fourth time, we are observing the EU Day Against Human Trafficking. We treat this problem very seriously. We are currently negotiating a proposal for a directive on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings.\nFourthly, and finally, I would like to invite you, on Wednesday at 12:00, to hear a mid-term review of my Presidency of the Parliament. It will chiefly summarise the progress of the European Parliament and especially what you have achieved during this time, and also initiatives which I have personally undertaken, where we are, and where we find ourselves in a changed European Union, what the European Parliament looks like and cooperation with other institutions. I believe that you are entitled to this information halfway through my term of office.\n", "Cosmetic products (recast version) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is Mrs Roth-Behrendt's report, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on cosmetic products (recast) - C6-0053/2008 -.\nDagmar Roth-Behrendt\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will probably not need the four minutes that are allocated to me at the start of the debate, as it is really a very simple and very pleasant matter that we are discussing today. We are discussing a new version of the Cosmetics Directive, which is now a regulation. This Regulation will, in fact, be brought up to date, and we would very much like to update it, improve it and make it more coherent.\nWe have three minor improvements in mind. On the one hand, the Regulation ensures that the use of carcinogenic substances in cosmetics has indeed been banned, but we have to keep a sense of proportion, so that substances which are permitted for use in foodstuffs are not banned for use in cosmetics, such as vitamin A or alcohol. This is something that the Commission has correctly recognised and taken into account in its proposal.\nThe Commission also rightly recognised the fact that new technologies, such as nanotechnology, need special attention, in particular when we are dealing with microscopic particles which may be able to pass through layers of skin. We simply want to ensure that they present no danger. Here, too, I am satisfied that we have achieved a compromise which I can wholeheartedly support.\nFinally, Mr President, there is something else we have to address, namely the product claims. We also ought to examine them and bring them up to date. If we got here today, having rushed to get here, and if our deodorant promised us this morning that we would be sweat-free for 14 hours, but we are nevertheless totally covered in sweat this evening, then we are likely to be very surprised and say that there is no truth t", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, I wish you all a very happy New Year, and declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 19 December 1997.\n\nApproval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of 19 December 1997 have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n(The Minutes were approved)\n\nGaleote Quecedo\nMr President, at the start of our last Parliamentary part-session, various Members from various political groups condemned the murder of Jos\u00e9 Luis Caso, a local councillor in the Basque Country. Also during that week, this House received a visit from the family of another local councillor, Miguel \u00c1ngel Blanco, who was also murdered some months previously, 48 hours after having been kidnapped.\nOn Friday, Mr President, Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Iruretagoyena, a local councillor in Zarautz, was murdered. All of them were Basques, \"guilty' of having been democratically elected to represent their people - the Basque people.\nIn recent days there have also been acts of terrorism in other regions of the European Union. People are demanding that we, the representatives of the European peoples, should not just issue a condemnation, Mr President, but also commit ourselves to initiative and to boosting Community policies to combat terrorism. What is at stake is the most basic of all human rights, Mr President: the right to live.\n\nMedina Ortega\nMr President, I do not want to spend too much time on this, but obviously, the loss of a human life - the despicable murder of a representative of the Partido Popular , Mr Iruretagoyena, in Zarautz last week - means that we in the Group of the Party of European Socialists are forced to repeat our condemnation of this type of act. Europe needs to develop an awareness of pacifist issues, in order to avoid a repetition of such acts.\nThe Spanish people have repeatedly held demonstrations on this question. I believe that the rest of Europe supports us, as do the governments of the European countries, in our str", "Conclusions of the G20 Summit (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the conclusions of the G20 summit.\nPetr Ne\u010das\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 2 April 2009 the meeting of the G20 heads of state and government was held in London to discuss further steps towards the recovery of the global economy and the prevention of future crises on such a scale. At their meeting the heads of state and government promised to do everything necessary to restore confidence, economic growth and employment, to amend the financial system in order to renew credit flows, to strengthen financial regulation, to restore confidence to the market and to fund and reform our international financial institutions in order to enable them to provide effective help in tackling this crisis and to prevent future crises. At the same time the heads of state and government made a commitment that in the interests of boosting prosperity they would promote global trade and investment and reject protectionism and that they would prepare the economy for inclusive, environmentally-friendly and sustainable growth and recovery.\nThe EU played a very significant role through its proposals and attitudes. In many areas, if not in the most, the EU and the European members of the G20 were the prime movers, or among the prime movers, of the work in the preparatory groups and they significantly influenced the breadth of the agreed consensus and the final form of the agreed proposals. This applied to the areas of financial market regulation and supervision, complete transparency in the financial system, the rejection of protectionism, the pressure to complete the Doha Development Agenda and the approach to economic recovery including the emphasis on the need to clear out the financial sector by removing worthless assets and creating a basis for a sustainable global economy in the future. Last but not least was the commitm", "Explanations of vote (continuation) \nPresident\nWe still have three explanations of votes remaining.\nLaima Liucija Andrikien\n- Mr President, I welcome the fact that the total amount of irregularities in the way European funds are being used is declining. The fact that the amount of irregularities in the agricultural sector fell so dramatically by 34% is especially encouraging. A strong and competitive role for OLAF is among the factors that helped to improve the situation. I welcome the proposal enshrined in our resolution to increase cooperation among EU Member States in the area of taxation.\nHowever, I want to express my deep concern about the fact that fraudulent activities increased in the new Member States, especially Romania and Bulgaria. In EU-10 they grew by 8% while debt for the EU-2 increased by 152%. I want to express my strong support for the calls on Romania and Bulgaria to build up their administrative capacity to manage EU funding and improve the supervision and transparency of public procurement procedures at all levels.\nLaima Liucija Andrikien\n- Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Deutsch for his excellent report. Today's substantive discussion and our resolution, which I supported, is an excellent starting point for the future activities of the European Investment Bank, especially taking into account the EU 2020 Strategy.\nIn addition, I would like once again to urge the European governments to provide the EIB with a more significant lending capacity to our neighbours, especially those in the east, who are highly in need of loans and investments, and who are also suffering from the effects of the crisis. Compatibility between the policy goals of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the lending directions of the EIB should be ensured in the future even more than before.\nLaima Liucija Andrikien\nMr President, in January and March we witnessed mass atrocities in Nigeria which caused the deaths of several hundred people, including women a", "\nMaij-Weggen\nOn a point of order, Mr President. The television sets in our offices can, I believe, receive 36 channels. One of them was a Dutch channel carrying the Dutch morning, midday and evening news. Well, it is no secret that since the start of the week that channel has vanished from our screen. Can you please ask the authorities responsible to reinstate it so that we can once again receive the news from the Netherlands in the morning, at midday and in the evening?\n\nPresident\nCertainly, Mrs Maij-Weggen, we will see to that.\n\nApproval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nD\u00edez de Rivera Icaza\nMr President, I see that my name does not appear in yesterday's Minutes. I do not know whether this is due to an oversight on my part but I would be grateful if it could be rectified since I was present.\n\nPresident\nWe will try to do that, Mrs D\u00edez de Rivera Icaza.\n\nCoates\nMr President, I wanted to draw your attention to an article which has appeared in the European Parliament magazine. It is entitled: 'The EPLP's selection controversy'.\nMuch of this article is political commentary which is of no interest to Parliament as an institution. However, it contains some allegations which are worrying, including one to the effect that persons who wished to become Members of the panel for the forthcoming elections were compelled to sign a memorandum making over some of their staff allowances to the Labour Party. It is claimed - perhaps justly - that this may be a breach of European Parliament Rules.\nIs it possible for the presidency to examine this question and give us a ruling?\n\nPresident\nMr Coates, let me say for a start that the magazine you are referring to is not a European Parliament publication and Parliament is therefore not responsible for it. It is a magazine which receives support from the European Parliament so that it can give information about Parliament, but the Bureau and our services are not respo", "Approval of Minutes of previous sitting\nPresident\n(FR) The Minutes of the sitting of Monday 14 January 2008 have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\nCristiana Muscardini\n(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is very kind of you to give me the floor 20 minutes after I asked for it, even though I am right opposite the presidency. I want to speak for the record and for the sake of democracy in this Chamber.\nThe Presidency of Parliament and all the group chairmen must realise that two wrongs do not make a right. What is politically useful is not always politically correct and after listening today to the Grand Mufti we have to decide in a manner that is clear and unequivocal for all of us whether we in this Chamber follow the democratic provisions of the Rules of Procedure or follow the interest each individual may have according to circumstances.\nA mistake was made this morning with regard to Parliament's Rules of Procedure and we will not correct that error by voting today in an empty Chamber. We are making another mistake to the detriment of democracy here. I am not saying on behalf of the UEN Group whether it is important to discuss the waste in Italy at 9 p.m. this evening or at 5 p.m. tomorrow, or whether it is important for explanations of vote to follow the vote, as has always been the custom in this Parliament, when the vote is expressed as it should have been this morning. I do ask you, however, Mr President - and you may cut me off, that does not interest me at all - what this Parliament's Rules of Procedure say? Do you know? In regard to this question, you want to reply to this deserted Chamber that it should vote on the basis of those who were given the floor and not those who wanted to express an independent view! That is madness!\nPresident\n(FR) Madame President, I trust my tone will be as measured as your own was agitated. I gave you the floor because I wished to know whether you were for or against approval of the Minutes of Monday 14 January", "Presentation of the Court of Auditors' annual report - 2007\nPresident\nThe next item is the presentation of the Court of Auditors' Annual Report for 2007.\nV\u00edtor Manuel da Silva Caldeira\nPresident of the European Court of Auditors. - Mr President, it is an honour for me to be able to take part in your debate on the Court of Auditors' annual report on the 2007 financial year, which I have already presented to the Committee on Budgetary Control on 10 November.\nOverall, the Court's audit opinion on the accounts is now unqualified - positive, if you wish - but the opinion on underlying transactions is broadly similar to that of last year.\nOn the accounts, the Court concludes that they give a fair presentation, in all material respects, of the financial position of the European Communities and cash flows at the year end. Owing to the improvements that have taken place, the qualifications expressed last year are no longer necessary.\nAs regards the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions, the Court gives unqualified opinions for revenue, commitments and payments for 'economic and financial affairs' and 'administrative and other expenditure'.\nAs regards 'administrative and other expenditure', which accounts for EUR 8 billion in 2007, the Court acknowledges the decisions and actions taken by the institutions to further improve financial management based on the recommendations made by the Court, including those taken by the European Parliament. The Court will assess their impact in future years.\nHowever, for 'agriculture and natural resources', 'cohesion', 'research, energy and transport', 'external aid, development and enlargement', and 'education and citizenship' the Court concludes that payments are still materially affected by errors, although to different degrees. Supervisory and control systems covering these areas are judged to be at best only partially effective, although in 'research' and, at the level of the Commission, for 'external aid, development an", "2. Greenhouse gas emission allowance trading system (\n- Before the vote:\nMarkus Pieper\n(DE) Mr President, my justification is as follows. Unfortunately, no plenary debate, the result of which we could have taken to the trialogue, was held on ETS. Trialogue negotiations merely on the basis of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety are not representative of Parliament. Now, we are supposed to endorse the amendments to the Commission's proposal; but what we are supposed to be deciding on today matches the Council paper one-to-one. There is not a single alteration by Parliament, even so much as a comma. What is the reason for this time pressure? After all, we are talking about a period from 2013 onwards.\nWith the ETS proposal in its current form, inconsistencies and ballooning costs will catch up with us. The subject of emissions trading is the most important industrial policy decision for years, if not decades, to come. We are not prepared to hand in our democratic right of codecision at the Parliament cloakroom. After all, what is it that many Members have successfully fought for in this House for almost 30 years? Have they fought to see climate policy left almost entirely to the Council through a simplified procedure? As an elected parliament, we wish to engage in democratic debate and to do so specifically in view of the consequences of our actions. Thank you very much.\n", "Sustainable mobility (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Etelka Barsi-Pataky, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on Keep Europe moving - Sustainable mobility for our continent\nEtelka Barsi-Pataky \nrapporteur. - (HU) Parliament welcomes the mid-term review of the fundamental document of Europe's transport policy, the White Paper. We are pleased that the Commission has prepared its report on the subject after broad coordination, and that it has done a thorough job. We also welcome the fact that it has made suggestions in several areas with regard to modifying the existing transport policy.\nParliament recognises the achievements of the past five years, while at the same time we are critical on several matters. Parliament requests the Council and the Commission to consider our recommendations as the cornerstone of European transport policy.\nNow, what do these consist of? First of all, the experience of past years shows that the use of regulation is the weak point of transport policy. As for implementation, it has been the case more than once that this came only after considerable delay, while sometimes it has been done incompletely or not at all. The Commission's report does not face up with sufficient thoroughness or honesty to this problem, and therefore it does not suggest appropriate solutions. Parliament emphasises the importance of cooperation among the European, national and regional levels, of strengthening this cooperation and of working together.\nSecond, the majority in Parliament is of the opinion that we need to shape our transport policy more realistically than was done in the past. The review quite rightly observes that transport, as a service, plays a key role in the economy and in society, and that it is inseparable from the latter; our recommendation is therefore that we integrate it fully into the Lisbon Strategy.\nFor the most part, we agree that existing capacities must be utilised more efficiently on their own or in i", "5. Requesting an opinion from the Court of Justice on the compatibility with the Treaties of the Protocol on the EU-Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement (\nAndrew Duff\nauthor. - Mr President, the motion seeks to refer the protocol for an opinion to the Court. The purpose of this, the sole purpose of this, is to test the compatibility of the agreement with our Treaty obligation to respect the international law. The effect of the reference will not be to suspend the present agreement. The reference could set a precedent, but Parliament has a clear duty to establish the integrity of all the treaties.\n", "Energy security (Nabucco and Desertec) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on energy security in relation to the Nabucco and Desertec projects.\nAndris Piebalgs\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, energy will definitely continue to be the focus of this Parliament for the next five years. At the same time, we have made good progress over the last five years in establishing a robust European energy policy with three goals: security of supply, sustainability and competitiveness.\nIn achieving all these goals, the external dimension is extremely important for two reasons. Firstly, EU import dependency - currently, 50% of energy resources come from outside the European Union, and the trend is upwards.\nSecondly, issues related to sustainability. The climate change goals cannot be achieved anywhere in the world unless energy is produced more cleanly and used more efficiently. For this reason, dialogue with the producer, transit and consumer countries is crucial.\nThe two projects mentioned in today's plenary are, in a way, complementary and at the same time fit well into the overall strategy.\nFirst of all, Nabucco. I came from Baku yesterday, and we are definitely still on course to fulfil this project. We made a major breakthrough this July. An intergovernmental agreement was signed between four European countries and Turkey, which means that we could already take a final investment decision next year with a view to having gas supplies by 2014.\nWe have identified three sources that are ready to commit gas volumes. Firstly, there is Azerbaijan, where the final investment decision about Shah Deniz 2 should be made in the very near future, and then there are other fields, in Turkmenistan and Iraq, which at this stage are the biggest sources of supply.\nWhere are the difficulties? There are always difficulties related to the particular way we operate in the energy field and how a lot of producer countries are organised. In the European Union, proje", "Order of business\nPresident\nThe final draft of the agenda for this sitting, as agreed by the Conference of Presidents at their meeting on Thursday 8 January 2009, in accordance with Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been circulated. It has been requested that this draft be amended as follows.\nMonday:\nAs Mrs Andrikiencannot be present this evening to present her report on the development of the UN Human Rights Council and the role of the EU, there will be a vote on this report on Wednesday, as scheduled, without a general discussion.\nTuesday: No amendments.\nWednesday:\nThe Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has moved to conclude the general discussion on the situation in Gaza with the submission of motions for a resolution. Mr Cohn-Bendit will speak to justify the motion.\nDaniel Cohn-Bendit\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, everyone is aware of the situation in Gaza. That we should discuss it here in Parliament is perfectly natural. However, we are calling for the Security Council to take a stand, we are calling for the bodies to take a stand, and for the European Union to take a stand, but we, in Parliament, we debate matters but we do not want to take a stand. I do however believe that, faced with the urgency of the situation in Gaza, it is extremely important for this House to give its opinion and say exactly what it wants, in order to end the massacres currently taking place in the Middle East. I find it unacceptable that this House should not have the courage or the lucidity to vote in favour of a resolution after our debate. That is why our group is calling for the Conference of Presidents' decision to be reviewed and for the debate that we must hold on the Gaza situation to end in a resolution, one that demonstrates the clear and firm position of this House, of a majority, so that the massacres in Gaza stop. We want a resolution; we must be aware that we have a political responsibility faced with the current situation, and this politica", "Voting time\nPresident\nThe next item is voting time.\n(For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)\nColleagues, you always insist that we start the vote on time, but it is in your hands! Please settle down and take your seats.\n", "2007 discharge: EU general budget - Council (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the second report on discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2007, Section II - Council (C6-0417/2008 - - Committee on Budgetary Control. Rapporteur: S\u00f8ren Bo S\u00f8ndergaard\nS\u00f8ren Bo S\u00f8ndergaard\nThank you, Mr President. Seven months ago - on 23 April to be precise - a large majority in this House refused to grant discharge to the Council's budget for 2007. Why? It was because the Council's behaviour in respect of Parliament and the Committee on Budgetary Control was completely unacceptable. The Council refused to answer written questions that we put to it about its budget and refused to meet with the Committee on Budgetary Control and answer questions. The situation was so absurd that representatives of the Council immediately left any meeting at which questions concerning the Council's budget were asked.\nIn reality, this was nothing new. It had, in fact, been going on for many years. What was new was that in April, Parliament put a stop to it. I think that in April, most Members asked themselves a simple question: how can I, as a Member of the European Parliament, be responsible to my voters for the Council's budget if the Council will not even answer the questions put to it by Parliament? I believe that this was the question that resulted in a large majority of Members of this House refusing to grant discharge for the Council's budget. Perhaps some people thought that Parliament would become more amenable after the elections in June, or that Parliament's demands for openness and transparency smacked of election promises rather than a real change of attitude. If so, they will have been disappointed.\nEven after the election, we on the Committee on Budgetary Control have been united in our very simple stance: if the Council wishes us to grant discharge for its budget, then it must meet with us and answer our questions. At the en", "Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes\nZuzana Roithov\u00e1\n(CS) Mr Chairman, I would just like to ask whether today's special regime will be repeated or whether it was really only today's extravaganza. Can you give me an answer, please?\nPresident\nAs I understand it, this was an exceptional situation as regards the number of applications. I hope that this situation will not be repeated.\n", "2. Support for the Special Court for Sierra Leone\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions concerning support for the Special Court for Sierra Leone.\nCorina Cre\u0163u\nauthor. - (RO) One of the problems affecting justice systems in many countries around the world is not so much the absence of a well-structured legal framework, but more particularly the lack of enforcement of the judgments made by the justice system. In countries afflicted by the scourge of civil war, a permanent state of conflict or massacres, the consequences of this situation are catastrophic from a humanitarian and development perspective.\nIn the case of the Special Court for Sierra Leone, it is all the more important that legal judgments are enforced because this court is establishing a series of important precedents in international law. It is not only the first court of this kind set up in the same country as where the events being tried took place, but it is the first which has indicted and convicted, in the person of Charles Taylor, the former president of Liberia, an African head of state still in office at the time when the trial started.\nThese aspects, combined with the recent conviction of three former rebel leaders from the civil war period, are strong indications of the determination of the international community and Sierra Leone Government to fight hard against the feeling of impunity displayed by those who have committed atrocities for an entire decade.\nThe international community must fully complete the implementation of the project proposed for reinforcing the process of justice and law in Sierra Leone. The Court's mandate comes to an end soon, in 2010, and the Sierra Leone Government has been totally frank about not being able to ensure that the sentences passed will be enforced.\nIt is vital therefore for the European Union and its international partners involved in the peace process to uphold and support the enforcement of the sentences passed by the Speci", "4. Community action programme in the field of consumer policy (2007 - 2013) (vote) \n- Before the vote\nMarianne Thyssen \nrapporteur. - (NL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I simply want to note that we, since we have reached an agreement with the Council and Commission ahead of time, can finalise this report at second reading, which will make it possible for the action programme in question to enter into effect on time, that is to say on 1 January of next year.\nSecondly, I should like to point out that we have managed to secure a separate consumer programme after all, one with its own budget and that can develop its own momentum, and I think this is something the consumers will appreciate.\nFinally, we have pinpointed three important new areas for consideration:\nFirst of all, we have asked for more attention for new Member States that do not have as long a tradition in the area of consumer protection. Secondly, we have managed to turn the spotlight to the older consumer, for, after all, consumer law should give due consideration to demographic developments. Thirdly, in this action programme, we have managed - and this I consider to be of particular importance - to draw particular attention to the vulnerable consumer who in consumer law, where we need to work with the concept of the average consumer, cannot really be given a voice.\nI do think this is important. We may not have had a debate, but I thought it would be useful anyway to share this information and drive these important points home to you. I can only emphatically appeal to you to vote in favour of the common position, for it reproduces exactly our agreement in this House and among the institutions.\n", "Tribute\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, I have the sad duty of informing you of the death of the Greek Deputy Foreign Minister, Yannos Kranidiotis, in an accident, and also that of five other people who were accompanying him, including his 23-year-old son.\nThe Minister was on an official mission. He was travelling with 12 other people to Bucharest when his plane lost altitude and dropped from 25,000 feet to 3,000 feet without crashing, finally coming to land at the airport in Bucharest.\nSome of you will certainly recall that Yannos Kranidiotis was a Member of the European Parliament between January 1995 and February 1997, when he was appointed as a Minister in the Greek Government, and you will remember that he was, within our Parliament, a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Budgets, as well as being the Vice-President of the joint European Union/Cyprus delegation.\nMany of us have memories of our late colleague. I shall say that he was greatly appreciated for his qualities as a human being and for his competence in the field of European politics.\nI propose that we observe a minute' s silence in his memory.\n(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)\n\nApproval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nBar\u00f3n Crespo\nMadam President, first of all, I must express my appreciation, on behalf of my group, for the tribute which has been paid to the memory of Mr Kranidiotis. But I had requested the floor in accordance with Rule 122 of the Rules of Procedure to make an intervention for personal reasons, concerning the accusations made against me yesterday by Mr Galeote during the debate on the investiture of President Prodi. In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, this is the appropriate moment in the proceedings. As I cannot see Mr Galeote in the Chamber, I leave it to your discretion as to whether I speak now or when he is present.\n\nPresident\nI think, Mr Bar\u00f3n Crespo, tha", "25. Common rules for the internal market in electricity (\n- Before the vote:\nEluned Morgan\nrapporteur. - Mr President, Parliament has moved from its first-reading position on the Electricity and Gas Directive. I would just like briefly to explain why.\nThe report as it stands is far from perfect, but we believe that we have made substantial gains for energy consumers in the European Union. We have put the issue of energy poverty onto the European agenda for the very first time and we have ensured the independence of the national regulatory authorities and given them an increased role to police the new system.\nWe would like, however, to encourage the Commission and, in particular, the competition authorities to continue their work in ensuring that companies that own both generation and transmission systems play by the rules and do not abuse their positions.\nI would like to thank colleagues for all their help over the years.\n", "Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting\nMartin Schulz\n(DE) Mr President, I have no comments on the minutes of yesterday's session, but instead I would like to comment on an incident in this morning's session. My colleague, Kinga G\u00f6ncz, a Member of Parliament in my group and former Hungarian Foreign Minister, was insulted in the debate this morning by Krisztina Morvai from the fascist Jobbik party in a completely unacceptable way. As Foreign Minister for Hungary, Mrs G\u00f6ncz has worked harder than almost anyone else in the country to achieve international reconciliation between Hungary and its neighbouring countries. I would like to reject emphatically the outrageous insult made to Mrs G\u00f6ncz by Mrs Morvai, a member of a neo-fascist party.\n(Applause)\nKinga G\u00f6ncz\n(HU) Thank you for this opportunity to speak. I am very sorry that this discussion is being held here in the European Parliament. I would also like to respond briefly by saying that the party represented by Krisztina Morvai set up a paramilitary unit in 2006 and, since then, is using it to intimidate the peaceful public majority.\nThis includes, in particular, minorities, gays, Roma and Jews. This paramilitary unit was recently disbanded by the courts, but an MEP from this party wore the uniform of this organisation in this chamber during the July session. In Hungary, this party conducted a campaign full of anti-European, racist, homophobic, anti-Roma and xenophobic diatribes and regularly described Hungary as a colony of the European Union in its utterances. The event which Krisztina Morvai spoke about took place in 2006 when these extreme right-wing protesters set the Hungarian television broadcasting corporation's central building on fire and ran riot for days, resulting in 113 police officers being injured.\nThey ran riot again on 23 October. They tried, in fact, to disrupt a national ceremony using violence. This was the first time in the country's history, since the change of regime, that the police ", "Autonomous Community tariff quotas on imports of certain fishery products into the Canary Islands (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Galeote, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation opening and providing for the administration of autonomous Community tariff quotas on imports of certain fishery products into the Canary Islands, - C6-0153/2008 -.\nJoe Borg\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all allow me to thank the rapporteur, Mr Gerardo Galeote for this report, which I can fully support, and for his efforts in dealing with this file in the most diligent manner. I am also pleased to note the strong support of the Committee on Regional Development for this proposal.\nThe Canary Islands are one of the European Union's outermost regions and are characterised by their geographical and economic isolation. The European Union has long recognised the need to reduce, eliminate or temporarily suspend customs tariffs in order to encourage production in such regions by facilitating the supply of raw materials. Since 1991, the European Union has suspended, partially or in full, the common customs tariff duties on imports into the Canary Islands of a number of products. In the case of fisheries products, such measures applied only to raw materials to be used in products solely intended for consumption in the local market.\nThe import quotas at reduced tariff proposed now by the Commission follow on from similar measures laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 704/2002 of 25 March 2002, which covered the period from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2006. The tariff quotas are to be seen, in terms of support to the Canary Islands' economy, as complementing other measures taken on the basis of Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty, in particular the scheme to compensate for the additional costs incurred in the marketing of certain fishery products from the outermost regions - implemented by means of Council R", "Question Time (Council) \nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B6-0231/2009).\nThe following questions have been submitted to the Council.\nMr Kohout is here representing the Council. I should like to take this opportunity to welcome the decision made today by the Czech Senate, which gives us high hopes of the future ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon.\nSubject: Protection of European creative works\nGiven that European creative works are being undermined by the growing plethora of pirated copies, what measures does the Council propose in order to afford real protection?\nJan Kohout\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, thank you for your kind words addressed to the Czech Republic and to the Senate. We are also very pleased that the green light for the Lisbon Treaty is now much stronger than it was a few hours before.\nIn response to the first question, I would like to say that the Council shares the concerns expressed by the honourable Member relating to the need to comprehensively address the problem of piracy of protected works. This issue has been identified as a policy priority by both the European Parliament and the Council in the context of the overall effort to protect and foster innovation of European creators and consequently the competitiveness of the European economy.\nThe European Parliament and the Council have adopted Directive 2004/48/EC, which puts in place a Community framework for the enforcement of intellectual property rights and are currently working on a proposal for a directive on criminal measures, aimed at ensuring enforcement of such rights.\nThe legislative framework already in force provides for a solid base for the Member States to pursue effective protection of intellectual property rights, including by fighting piracy. Moreover, the European Community and the Member States are participating in ongoing negotiations, such as the draft anti-counterfeiting trade agreement, in order to render the protection of intellectual prop", "1. Election of the European Ombudsman (vote) \nMargot Wallstr\u00f6m\nVice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all, I want to congratulate Nikiforos Diamandouros on being elected European Ombudsman.\nAs was pointed out in his report from last year, the crucial work is about building citizens' trust in the EU, and we can all subscribe to that. We all have an important role to contribute to that important work, both as institutions and as individuals.\nRelations between the Commission and the Ombudsman have always been very good and very constructive. I think our cooperation has become even smoother and more productive.\nThrough his inquiries, the European Ombudsman and his team have done a lot to help develop and reinforce a culture of service within the Commission. Very important lessons have been drawn from critical remarks made, and we also see an increase in the willingness to achieve friendly solutions. This development should continue, and I know the Commission will continue to follow closely the Ombudsman's activities and welcome his proposals.\nThe years to come are going to be interesting and challenging for the Ombudsman. I am, of course, thinking about the new possibilities offered by the Treaty of Lisbon. As you all know, the right to good administration is enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.\nI am in no doubt that the Ombudsman will enhance his contribution to strengthening democracy in Europe. The tools are transparency and service-minded institutions. We all have a responsibility to support him in that work.\nSo, again, congratulations on your appointment, and I wish you all the best for the very important tasks that lie ahead of all of us.\n", "18. Prevention of the use of the financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing (implementing powers conferred on the Commission) (vote) \n- Report: Philip Bradbourn\n", "Crises in the car industry (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the crisis in the car industry.\nJean-Pierre Jouyet\nMadam President, Commissioner Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen, in the third quarter of this year, the European automotive industry has been hit by the deepening crisis in the global economy. This comes after the industry's good performance in the second quarter of the year. All the leading automotive markets in the world are being affected, but with differing levels of seriousness.\nSales in the United States have fallen by 32% in a year, reaching their lowest level in 25 years. The three big American car manufacturers - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler - have requested emergency aid from the Federal State. The emerging markets which, until this summer, offset the fall in sales for these countries, have also been hit by the crisis, but to a lesser degree.\nIn China, sales were down 1.4% in September. This is the second consecutive month of falling sales in China, following the 6.3% drop in August.\nIn Brazil, car sales were down 11% last month, for the first time since 1999.\nThe automotive market has not yet fallen in Russia, but there is a significant slowdown in this market and it could experience the first falls at the beginning of next year.\nWe can clearly see, then, that the situation is also worsening in the large emerging countries.\nIn Europe, vehicle registrations were down almost 4% over the period from the start of the year to last August. The end of the year may prove difficult and the decline in the automotive market could be around 5% for the whole of 2008, which, for this market, would be the worst result recorded since 1993.\nThroughout the world, however, the automotive industry is making considerable efforts to tackle the crisis and is trying to find the foundations for new growth. The measures to reduce production will have negative knock-on effects on jobs in all value chains as well as", "9. Active dialogue with citizens on Europe (\n- Before the vote\nGyula Hegyi\nrapporteur. - Mr President, I will be very brief. On my advice, the Socialist members of the Committee on Culture abstained during the final vote on this report.\nAs rapporteur, I was rather unsatisfied with the outcome of the votes on the amendments. Many of our fresh and pioneering ideas were voted out by other political groups. In my opinion, an own-initiative should be a brave - sometimes even provocative - document, free of the old dogmas. I planned to abstain, and to call on my comrades to abstain, in the plenary vote as well, but my wise and tolerant female colleagues convinced me that this would not be a good idea and that a watered-down report is better than nothing. So I would ask the House to support the report in its present form, in the hope there will be a chance to improve it in the future.\n", "3. North Caucasus, in particular the case of Oleg Orlov\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on North Caucasus, in particular the case of Oleg Orlov.\nHeidi Hautala\nauthor. - Mr President, I would like to say that this resolution on the situation in the North Caucasus, and in particular on the case of Oleg Orlov, is one of the most deserving resolutions this House has adopted for a long time.\nThe tragedy reigning in the North Caucasus has only deepened in recent years with pervasive human rights violations still affecting the daily lives of the communities in Chechnya, in Ossetia, Dagestan, North Ossetia and Kabardino-Balkaria.\nThe violence is far from over. Only last Tuesday, at least six people were killed in an attack on Chechnya's Parliament building in Grozny. At least 17 people were injured, most of them civilians. On 9 September, 17 people were killed and many others wounded in a bombing in Vladikavkaz, the capital of North Ossetia.\nThe tragedies of the past are not accounted for either. The families of victims in Beslan still do not know what exactly happened to their children and loved ones, how they died or where their bodies are.\nNot only has the vicious circle of violence and impunity left these communities distraught and paralysed, the failure to tackle the situation has led the violence to spread beyond the borders of the North Caucasian republics.\nWhile Muscovites have felt the trauma of terrorism, Chechen refugees in Europe fear persecution, even murder. People disappear even in the capital city, Moscow, or in St Petersburg, as has happened during the past year.\nSo there comes a point when this must stop. The winner of the 2009 Sakharov Prize, Mr Orlov, being placed under criminal charges could be the point at which Europe finally says enough is enough.\nThe EU should seek now to cooperate with the Council of Europe on the excellent report produced by Dick Marty on legal remedies for human rights violations in the North ", "8. Commission White Paper: \"Adapting to climate change: Towards a European framework for action\" (\nVittorio Prodi\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, climate change is a real threat that we must be ready to face despite the varying impact it will have on our countries. The degradation of ecosystems will cause a severe blow to the health of our economies and of European citizens. We have already in the past called for climate diplomacy and justice: now we have to build it, speaking with a single voice.\nI am convinced that the European Union must maintain the lead in the battle against climate change and that any delay in implementing that action will increase environmental, social and economic costs out of all proportion. We must first of all recognise the central role of local and regional authorities and the need to work with them to coordinate environmental and economic innovation facilitated by technological progress.\nBy adopting the White Paper, we call on the Commission and Member States to promote public-private partnerships to help finance all of the initiatives tied to the adaptation policies. Each square metre of our territory has to be cared for to preserve the soil and retain water so as to prevent erosion and to supply the aquifers, including through direct reinjection of surface waters. In order for adaptation to be possible, a systemic approach which includes renewable energies will be necessary.\nI would like to warmly thank all of my colleagues who contributed to the success of this report.\n(Applause)\n", "Implementation of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the oral question to the Commission by Sharon Bowles on the Single European Payment Area (SEPA).\nSharon Bowles\nauthor. - Mr President, my predecessor as Chair of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee brought a resolution on SEPA to this Chamber on 12 March 2009. Not much has changed and now I bring mine here in March 2010. Can I say that we really do expect progress before the Ides of March 2011.\nThe Commission has made an effort in its SEPA roadmap of September 2009. We agree with the actions in the six priority areas, but a large majority of the respondents of the Commission's own consultation said that it was necessary to fix an end date in order to incentivise the reluctant. Those are the Commission's own words. Now, you cannot put it any straighter than that, and we suggest that the binding end date be fixed for no later than 31 December 2012.\nWe live in times when there are increasing numbers of cross-border purchases and contracts. Having common standards for these cross-border payments, credit transfers and direct debits is an important part of the health and growth of the single market. It is much better for consumers when they do not have to check whether there are different arrangements from country to country or get caught out because there are.\nSo consumers are not unfavourable to this project, but they do have to have security, and it is a worry if there are not sufficient safeguards for the management and checking of the mandate of direct debits. Payment systems take up one third of the operating costs of banks so there is a lot in it for banks to get SEPA right, but they cannot have it all their own way. The European Payments Council must recognise that consumers are worried about frauds and confidence tricks, and who is looking out for them. Some busy people may not notice a new transaction, especially if the amount is a common one. Therefore, there mus", "1. Remuneration of directors of listed companies and remuneration policies in the financial services sector (\nBefore the vote:\nSa\u00efd El Khadraoui\nMadam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to ask you to support my request that the vote on my report be taken by roll call. I have informed the shadow rapporteurs of this and my understanding is that they support this. I believe that that will more clearly highlight the broad support which the report has received in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Thank you for your understanding.\n", "Situation in Burma (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Burma.\nManuel Lobo Antunes\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate and our discussions are highly topical and, of course, the Council and the Portuguese Presidency are monitoring events in Burma (Myanmar) with extreme concern.\nIt has been almost 20 years, in fact since the events of 1988, since Burma has witnessed the kind of demonstrations that are occurring at the moment. There is no doubt that what many commentators are saying about these latest events is true: namely that the country is at a crossroads which we regard as critical.\nFrom the start the situation has proved to be highly volatile and, although we have made every effort to prevent the Burmese authorities from resorting to violence, today's events demonstrate that, very unfortunately, the military junta in Rangoon is still deaf to the appeals of the international community, as it has been for many years to the constant and repeated international appeals.\nIf well managed, the situation in recent days could have presented an unprecedented opportunity for the first steps to be taken along the road to urgent political reform and national re-evaluation of the country. We hoped that the junta would listen to the unequivocal message being sent by the demonstrators that its policies have failed.\nWhat was in the beginning an ad hoc protest against the disproportionate rise in the price of fuel has become a vast public protest movement against the general policies of a highly dictatorial government.\nAware of the growing tension in the country, the European Union has not just stood back and watched the situation. Immediately in August it vehemently condemned the detention of various opposition leaders, in particular the so-called '88 Generation' group, which was protesting against the almost 500% rise in fuel prices. It cal", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nFord\nMr President, on a point of order under Rule 9 - Code of conduct. Last month Parliament rightly demanded openness and transparency with respect to the Commission, yet Parliament at the moment is being hypocritical in respect of its own openness and transparency. What is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander. Rule 9(2) and Annex I (Article 3) indicate that declarations of Members' interests should be available to the public. At the moment the register is only available in the three working places - Luxembourg, Brussels and Strasbourg. It is very difficult for me to defend that when I receive questions in my constituency. If someone wants to look at the register, they have to travel abroad.\nMr President, I should like to ask you whether you will give an interpretation of the Rules to say that 'available to the public' means that it should be available in Parliament's information offices. If you are not prepared to do that, will you refer the matter to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities because, as a member of that committee, you are very well aware that it was the clear intention of the committee that 'available to the public' should mean in each Member State?\n\nPresident\nMr Ford, I will check the matter you have raised. In fact there was an amendment asking for the register to be made available in every Member State but Parliament rejected it. I cannot give an interpretation against what was clearly the will of the House at that moment. I will refer the matter to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, as you request, so that it can submit the appropriate proposal, if necessary. In which case it would be necessary to translate the declarations from Members which, at present, are only available in their original languages.\n\nGreen\nMr Pre", "Order of business\nPresident\nThe final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 14 January 2010 pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed. The following amendments have been proposed:\nTuesday:\nI have received a request from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament on winding up the debate on Haiti with the tabling of motions for resolution, to be put to the vote during the first session in February.\nHannes Swoboda\nMr President, naturally, we also wish you all the best for the New Year.\nI would like to know whether you will be coming back to the resolution on Haiti. We should like to move a resolution on Haiti, which must, at all costs, be decided in February.\nWednesday:\nI have received a request from the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group to place on the agenda for voting time the motions for a resolution on defence of the principle of solidarity, to wind up the debate held on 15 December 2009.\nFrancesco Enrico Speroni\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are two reasons in favour: firstly, the importance of the subject - I find it a little strange for Parliament to refuse to vote. Everyone has their own opinions, everyone can think as they see fit, but as a Parliament, I think that we have a duty to give an opinion on this subject as each of us feels is appropriate.\nSecondly, this House has already requested and voted on the inclusion of this item as a voting item, moving it from December to January. Now I believe that the Bureau, or, rather, the Conference of Presidents, should not have gone against a precise and timely decision by the House, and I therefore think that the House should express its views on this point shortly.\nHannes Swoboda\nMr President, we have had some very heated debates. We have seen that there are actually very differing opinions on these findings of a court of justice that is not an EU court. We shou", "Getting a grip on energy prices (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on:\nthe oral question to the Council on Getting a grip on energy prices, by Hannes Swoboda, on behalf of the PSE Group - B6-0460/2008)\nthe oral question to the Commission on Getting a grip on energy prices, by Hannes Swoboda, on behalf of the PSE Group - B6-0461/2008)\nthe oral question to the Council on Getting a grip on energy prices, by Giles Chichester, Anne Laperrouze, Sophia in 't Veld and Eugenijus Maldeikis, on behalf of the PPE-DE, ALDE and UEN Groups - B6-0463/2008)\nthe oral question to the Commission on Getting a grip on energy prices, by Giles Chichester, Anne Laperrouze, Sophia in 't Veld and Eugenijus Maldeikis, on behalf of the PPE-DE, ALDE and UEN Groups - B6-0465/2008)\nthe oral question to the Commission on Getting a grip on energy prices, by Rebecca Harms and Claude Turmes, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group - B6-0466/2008),\nthe oral question to the Council on Getting a grip on energy prices, by Esko Sepp\u00e4nen and Ilda Figueiredo, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group - B6-0468/2008),\nthe oral question to the Commission on Getting a grip on energy prices, by Esko Sepp\u00e4nen and Ilda Figueiredo, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group - B6-0469/2008).\nHannes Swoboda\nauthor. - (DE) Mr President, I would like to welcome the Commissioner and Minister Borloo very warmly. We have a number of questions because we feel, quite honestly, that the European Union - and this applies to the Commission and perhaps also to the Council - has devoted too little attention to oil price trends. Although I have the greatest respect for the Commissioner, I believe that we should be doing more here.\nLet me turn, firstly, to rising oil prices. I have always pointed out, Commissioner, that substantial profits are being made. What is happening to them? In reality, they are not being invested in alternative energies, for example, or in other important investment projects; instead, they are being used to buy up shares a", "Cross-border collective copyright management (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the follow-up of the EP resolution on cross-border collective copyright management (L\u00e9vai report, by Giuseppe Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs - B6-0381/2007).\nCristian Dumitrescu  \nauthor. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 13 March 2007, in plenary session, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the Commission's Recommendation of 18 October 2005 on collective cross-border management of copyright and related rights for legitimate online music services.\nIn that resolution, Parliament invited the Commission to make it clear that the 2005 Recommendation applied exclusively to online sales of music recordings, and to present as soon as possible - after consulting closely with interested parties - a proposal for a flexible framework directive to be adopted by Parliament and the Council in codecision, with a view to regulating the collective management of copyright and related rights as regards cross-border online music services, while taking account of the specificity of the digital era and safeguarding European cultural diversity.\nParliament also stressed that the proposed directive should not in any way undermine the competitiveness of creative businesses, the effectiveness of the services provided by collective rights managers (CRMs) or the competitiveness of user businesses - in particular small right-holders and users - and that it should, on the other hand, guarantee right-holders a high degree of protection and equal treatment; ensure that the relevant legal provisions had a real, significant and adequate impact; emphasise the use of alternative dispute resolution; provide for democratic, transparent and accountable governance in CRMs; promote creativity and cultural diversity; allow only fair and controlled competition without territorial restrictions, but with the necessary and suitable qu", "Financial and economic situation in Moldova (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the economic and financial situation in Moldova.\nLeonard Orban\nMember of the Commission. - (RO) The elections that were re-run on 29 July in the Republic of Moldova were a crucial test of the country's ability to consolidate its democratic development and continue to progress towards rapprochement with the European Union. We are pleased that the elections were held in a calm, orderly atmosphere and that the new government has not only expressed its firm intention to favour a pro-European course, but has also adopted a number of measures pointing in this direction.\nOn the other hand, the new authorities in the Republic of Moldova are facing enormous difficulties. One of the most serious crises and biggest difficulties is the need to tackle the consequences of the economic and financial crisis. Among the European Union's neighbours to the east, the Republic of Moldova is probably in the most precarious economic situation. Trade and industrial production have collapsed not only as a result of the crisis, but also due to the political unrest triggered by the parliamentary elections in April.\nThe amounts of money transferred from abroad by Moldovan citizens, which accounted, up until last year, for over a third of the country's GDP, have dropped far below the usual level. Exports and imports have fallen dramatically. The same applies to domestic demand and industrial production. A sharp drop is forecast for 2009, by even more than 10% of GDP.\nGiven that the Republic of Moldova is already the poorest country in Europe, this decline will hit particularly hard and will exacerbate even further the difficulties the population is struggling with, especially the most vulnerable people in society. In order to provide aid to the Republic of Moldova and its population, the European Union is prepared to support this country by offering it macrofinancial assistance, on top of", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 19 November 1999.\n\nTribute\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, many of you are new to this House but I am sure that all the re-elected Members will have a very clear memory of Carmen D\u00edez de Rivera Icaza. You will remember that she had to resign due to illness. She fought against this illness with great courage but I have to tell you that she died yesterday. She was a wonderful colleague who opposed conformism and fought for all noble causes, bringing passion to her work and a radiant smile which you all knew. I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to think about Carmen now and to observe a minute' s silence in her memory.\n(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)\n\nSalafranca S\u00e1nchez-Neyra\nMadam President, at the beginning of the last parliamentary term, and as the result of a misunderstanding, there was a public incident between myself and Mrs D\u00edez de Rivera. I am not going to comment on her political career for you have just done that admirably, but I must highlight, in public before this House, her human qualities, her personal values, her dignity and the fortitude and courage with which she faced her illness right to the very end. I must also emphasise what she did to overcome a difficult situation between us which ended in a warm and loyal friendship which allowed us to sign initiatives together before this House. I now feel proud to have been able to put my signature next to hers on those initiatives adopted by this House.\n\nBar\u00f3n Crespo\nMadam President, I must firstly thank you for your tribute to Carmen. If the cancer had not beaten her, I can assure you that she would have been here today, in her seat among our Group, in this House. As I have already told the President, I had the opportunity to visit Carmen in hospital two weeks ago and she asked me to say goodbye to all her colleagues. In particular, I want to thank two Members, her nephew \u00cd\u00f1", "Community Tobacco Fund (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Berlato, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 as regards the transfer of tobacco aid to the Community Tobacco Fund for the years 2008 and 2009 and Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 with regard to financing of the Community Tobacco Fund - C6-0062/2008 -.\nSergio Berlato\nrapporteur. - (IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the Commission proposal is basically to continue deducting 5% of the tobacco aid granted for the calendar years 2008 and 2009 and to use those funds to continue financing the Community Tobacco Fund, whose sole purpose is to finance information initiatives for improving European citizens' awareness of the harmful effects of tobacco consumption.\nFirst of all, I think it would be appropriate to highlight a few objective terms of reference. The transfer of CAP aid to the Fund is a rare and positive example of integration and cooperation between the agriculture and health policies of the European Union. Since the activities of the Fund are important for the citizens of the Union, and will continue to be important in the future, as the Commission has underlined, we consider that its continued financial support is necessary for 2007 and for 2009.\nThe deduction from coupled aid granted to farmers has always been the sole source of financing of the Community Tobacco Fund. The financial basis of this deduction was substantially reduced with the reform of the tobacco CMO and by the decision of some Member States to opt for complete decoupling, thereby completely depriving the Fund of the income from those deductions. It is necessary, by further extending the period of application of the deduction and by increasing its percentage rate, to make sufficient resources available from the Fund to finance programmes without impacting further on the EU budget, at l", "Question Time (Commission) \nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B7-0303/2011). Colleagues, please note that we are starting 40 minutes late.\nThe following questions are addressed to the Commission.\nGay Mitchell\nMr President, I know I am pushing an open door with you in raising this, but would say again that it really is not acceptable that Question Time be conducted in this way.\nThere is no Parliament in the world in which Question Time is not sacrosanct. I would ask you again to raise this matter with the Bureau.\nPresident\nMr Mitchell, it is not the Bureau, it is a matter for the Conference of Presidents, but no doubt the Swoboda reforms will make proposals on how to deal with this. I agree with you. It is totally unsatisfactory, but I took the chair at just 19.40 so I am not really responsible for the delay.\n\nSubject: Provision in the new draft budget for combating youth unemployment\nThe flagship initiative 'An agenda for new skills and jobs' underlines the fact that because of the crisis employment has fallen below 69%, while the figure for unemployment has risen to 10%; assuming that the job market will stabilise in 2010-2011, attainment of an employment rate of 75% by 2020 will require an average increase in employment of slightly more than 1% per year. At the same time, unemployment of young people under 25 is approaching 20%, while the persisting financial crisis is leading to a reduction in the employment rate, rather than the target of an annual 1% rise.\nHow, and with what provision in the draft budget will the Commission attempt to achieve by next year the objective of an average 1% increase in employment in the EU?\nDoes the Commission think that the proposed cuts in next year's budget will have a negative impact on the amounts allocated to education, training and boosting employment in the EU in general?\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Andor\nMember of the Commission. - As you all know, the EU headline targets under Europe 2020 include increasing the employment rate to 75%, ", "Rights of passengers in bus and coach transport - Rights of passengers when travelling by sea and inland waterway (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following:\nthe recommendation for second reading on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the common position adopted by the Council at first reading with a view to the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport and amending Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 (05218/3/2010 - C7-0077/2010 - (rapporteur: Antonio Cancian) and\nthe draft recommendation for second reading on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the common position adopted by the Council at first reading with a view to the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the rights of passengers when travelling by sea and inland waterway and amending Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 (14849/3/2009 - C7-0076/2010 - (rapporteur: In\u00e9s Ayala Sender).\nAntonio Cancian\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of the rights of passengers is highly topical, as shown by the fact that in recent days, the European Commission has launched a campaign to better inform citizens of the rights they enjoy when travelling by different modes of transport. I believe that this is an important initiative and also that it is Parliament's duty to make its contribution by adopting texts which shall have a beneficial effect on the travelling conditions of passengers.\nComing to the regulation that is being discussed today, I make no attempt to hide the feeling that I have taken from this negotiation, which is that the Member States do not want this regulation. The dossier for which I have had the honour of serving as rapporteur is very delicate, since it requires a balanced solution which, while providing rights for passengers, avoids penalising businesses involved in the public road transport sector. Indeed, almost al", "Question Hour with the President of the Commission\nPresident\nThe next item is the Question Hour with the President of the Commission.\nQuestions on any subject on behalf of political groups.\nThen the second part of the sitting - questions on the employment situation in the European Union.\nOthmar Karas\nMr President, Mr Barroso, the Centre for European Studies, the problems suffered by Greece, the Europe 2020 strategy and the search for answers to the financial and economic crisis all clearly indicate to us that in taking the necessary measures, we will soon reach the limits of what is possible under the existing treaties. On the other hand, many Member States are taking refuge in a new form of intergovernmentalism, nationalism and protectionism, instead of looking towards Europe.\nWhat do you plan to do to overcome these problems, to establish the necessary common objectives and to create credible European instruments, so that we are able to act effectively and provide the right answers?\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso\nPresident of the Commission. - It is true that, quite surprisingly, some national politicians are making an intergovernmental reading of the Lisbon Treaty. The Lisbon Treaty was agreed precisely to increase the European dimension; to reinforce the powers of the European Parliament; to make it easier to take decisions by qualified majority voting; and to reinforce the role of the Commission in economic surveillance and external affairs. This reading is therefore quite surprising, but it is indeed happening.\nThe role of the Commission is, of course, to be the guardian of the treaties, in accordance with Article 117 of the Lisbon Treaty, to protect European law and to be firm about the respect of European law, because the day the European Union is no longer a Community of law, it will no longer be a real Union.\nSecondly, its role is to promote initiatives and to take the lead in initiatives. To that end, it will do its job in trying to come forward with proposals which", "Explanations of vote\nPresident\nLet us now proceed to the explanations of votes.\n\nBogus\u0142aw Rogalski\n(PL) Madam President, I would like today to comment on the serious accusation which was made in this Chamber against Members of the European Parliament, and on the slander of the European Parliament uttered by Mr Martin when he said that some MEPs do not vote themselves, but send proxies, who vote using the MEPs' voting cards. This is unacceptable behaviour, because the proceedings of the European Parliament are transmitted live. The citizens of Europe are sitting in the balcony and they heard today, in an election year, something extraordinary. It is slanderous, and I would ask that at its next meeting the Bureau instruct Mr Martin to withdraw his words and to apologise to all the MEPs who sit in this Chamber.\nPresident\nMr Rogalski, you saw that I asked for it to be checked immediately whether it was true or false.\nIt is therefore on the record. It was false. It is therefore recorded in the Official Journal. I now ask for the President of Parliament to take the necessary action, and we will discuss it in the Bureau.\nGay Mitchell\nMadam President, you did indeed deal with it very speedily, but I do think that it is not acceptable that a Member should rise in his place and make such a serious allegation against other Members of the House. I hold no support for the gentlemen of the extreme right, but the President of Parliament must uphold and protect the rights of Members. We are being accused of all sorts of outrageous things, and we are entitled to proper conduct and ethical behaviour by our colleagues here in this House, and indeed outside the House.\nPresident\nIf you please, I have recorded everything that you have said. You have seen that we have tried to deal with these matters quickly, because they are important. I am entirely in agreement with you, and we will see what action is to be taken.\nChristopher Beazley\nMadam President, following that exchange and your ver", "3. The death penalty, particularly the case of Troy Davis\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the death penalty, particularly the case of Troy Davis.\nMarios Matsakis\nauthor. - Mr President, this House has taken a clear and strong stance as far as the death penalty is concerned. It supports its abolition and the need for an immediate moratorium on executions where the death penalty still applies.\nThe latter is the case in many states in the USA such as Georgia, where Troy Davis is awaiting his lawful killing to be carried out at the end of July. Apart from ideological and humanistic considerations against executing human beings, in the case of Troy Davis there appear to be additional reasons in the form of serious doubts as to the robustness and validity of the evidence which led to his conviction in the first place.\nSuch doubts, we believe, justify the reasoning of any individual using common sense that retrial should be granted in this case. Consequently we call on the relevant authorities in the USA to order that Troy Davis be retried and, if found guilty again, that his death sentence be commuted to life imprisonment.\nFurthermore, we call once again on the US Government, and all governments in the world that still have capital punishment, to abolish the death penalty in the interests of humanity. In particular we call on the governments of those countries such as China, Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia where executions are still carried out regularly, and where in many instances this is done in a most appallingly barbaric way, to stop executions.\nRyszard Czarnecki\nauthor. - (PL) Mr President, I would not want this to be a debate on the subject of the death penalty as such. Since we cannot conceal the fact that opinions differ on this matter, it seems to me that we should be talking about the very specific case of an individual who was given the death penalty, subsequent to which seven out of nine witnesses to the charge against ", "Statement by the President (Zimbabwe) \nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, I make this statement on Zimbabwe at the unanimous request of the chairmen of the groups. This is a very serious matter. Over recent weeks, there has been a further escalation in the political situation in that country, with violent acts committed by the forces under government control. On 11 March, a meeting in a suburb of the capital, Harare, was broken up by armed police and, in the course of this, Gift Tandare, a member of the opposition, was shot dead, while numerous demonstrators were injured. Forty leading opposition politicians, among them Morgan Tsvangirai and Arthur Mutambara - the leaders of the principal opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) - were arrested and mistreated while in police custody. On 18 March, an opposition member of the country's parliament, Nelson Chamisa, was beaten up, and ended up in hospital with serious injuries. He had been on his way to meetings of the committees of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly. This assault earned condemnation from the Bureau of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, and in this they were supported by the Assembly's African members. The Bureau called on the Zimbabwean Government to put a stop to the violence in the country and to respect human rights and the rule of law.\nLadies and gentlemen, we firmly condemn each and every act of violence and oppression committed by President Mugabe's Government. The Council and the Commission should work together with all the international, regional and national forces concerned to put in place a solution, in the shape of a transition from the present regime to a real democracy.\n(Applause)\nGlenys Kinnock\nMr President, I wanted to tell the House that one hour ago Morgan Tsvangirai was again arrested by the police and security forces in Harare. He and his staff were about to have a news conference to discuss the events which you described in your speech.\nI would therefore like this", "An international treaty prohibiting cluster bombs (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on:\nthe oral question to the Council on an international treaty to ban cluster munitions; follow-up to the Oslo Declaration, by Josep Borrell Fontelles, on behalf of the Committee on Development - B6-0319/2007);\nthe oral question to the Commission on an international treaty to ban cluster munitions - follow-up to the Oslo Declaration, by Josep Borrell Fontelles, on behalf of the Committee on Development - B6-0320/2007).\nJosep Borrell Fontelles\nauthor. - (ES) Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, the calls for a ban on cluster bombs are getting louder and louder. Use of these bombs in summer 2006 in the Lebanon war showed the extent to which they can cause a human disaster.\nThey are weapons that are a danger to both civilians and military personnel, but in practice 90% of their victims are civilians. In addition, 10% of these deadly bombs do not explode: they remain in the ground and have the same effect as landmines.\nTherefore, clearing the land contaminated with these munitions is dangerous, both for the populations and for the international peacekeeping forces. These bombs are not only used for war; they act as a long-term obstacle to transport and agriculture, and they create trade barriers and obstacles to humanitarian aid.\nThey are thus one of the main problems affecting the development of poor countries: it is the poorest countries that are most affected by them, and in those countries the main victims are the poorest and least-educated sections of the population.\nWe can no longer say that bombing one's opponents from a height of 10 000 metres and showering them with bombs that remain in the ground is an efficient way of maintaining peace or taking military action.\nThe deployment of peacekeeping forces and humanitarian aid are today essential to stabilise and rebuild the areas affected by conflict and these bombs now lack any justification, including from a mil", "5. Liability of carriers of passengers by boat in the event of accidents (vote) \n- Costa report\n- Before the vote\nPaolo Costa \nrapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am just taking the floor to say, for the sake of clarity, that as rapporteur I call on everyone, in all roll-call votes, to vote against anything not tabled by the committee.\nI do so to prevent the European Union from having to intervene the next time there is an accident on any major European river, because that might happen if we do not extend consumer protection to this sector as well.\nGeorg Jarzembowski\n(DE) Mr President, that was a very brief description of the problem. Both my own group and the other take the view that specific rules would offer better protection for passengers on inland vessels, since the present regulations, on which we are to vote, apply to sea-going traffic, and so I would just like to point out that we are doing no less for the passengers' safety if we table our amendments, and then - it is to be hoped - get a majority to vote for them.\n", "\n\n Please note that yesterday evening the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs unanimously adopted the report by Mr\u00a0Bourlanges. \nBourlanges (ALDE ),\n\u00a0\u00a0 .  Mr President, please excuse me, but the time it took to find the rapporteur, to get him seated, and to find him a microphone that works, means that his speaking time is pretty well used up.\nI simply wanted to say that we are in fact requesting urgent procedure for the measures relating to the freezing of the assets of war criminals in the former Yugoslavia. Our committee had already debated this before being asked to do so, which we were in fact doing only yesterday.\nThe Council has asked us for urgent procedure, and we regard that request as justified for the very simple reason that, as my grandmother used to say fifty years ago, you do not want to wait until the cows have gone before shutting the gate to the enclosure. What that means is that, if we want to act effectively in freezing the assets of war criminals, the procedure for doing so must be adopted as soon as possible. I therefore endorse the Council\u2019s request for urgent procedure, as does the committee of which I am chairman. \n\nBrok (PPE-DE ),\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my Committee, I ask that the request for urgent procedure be refused. The funding to be allocated to the new financial instrument for the Turkish Cypriot community \u2013 amounting to EUR\u00a0259 million \u2013 relates to the period from 2004 to 2006. Only EUR\u00a06 million was provided this year for feasibility studies, so this should not be a problem.\nI would add that the legal basis \u2013 Article 308, in consequence of which Parliament is still consulted \u2013 is not uncontentious, and I am being cautious in my use of language when I say that. I can also tell you, however, that, although we have no difficulties of any substance as regards the content of the Commission proposal, the political significance of this issue means that we do need more time to examine it mor", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 9 May 1996.\n\nMarset Campos\nMr President, this morning a terrorist attack was carried out in Cordoba. It was the work of the ETA terrorist group and resulted in the death of an army sergeant, Miguel Ayll\u00f3n. Our group wishes to express its revulsion and condemn this terrorist attack, requesting that condolences be sent to the victim's family while emphasising the importance of unity among democrats against terrorism in order to bring about a closer relationship among Europeans.\n\nPresident\nMr Marset Campos, the House has condemned this kind of terrorist attack on several occasions. We do so again in this case and I will express condolences and sympathy to the families on behalf of us all.\n\nOrder of business\nPresident\nThe next item is the order of business.\nThe final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 15 May 1996 pursuant to Rule 95 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.\nSitting of 20-24 May in Strasbourg\nPlease note that the deadline for tabling motions for resolutions on Cuba is set at 12 noon on Tuesday; the deadline for tabling amendments is 12 noon on Wednesday.\nRegarding speaking time: with a view to a more flexible allocation of speaking time on Wednesday afternoon and Wednesday evening, the Union for Europe Group has proposed setting an overall amount of speaking time for the periods 3 p.m. to 5.30 p.m. and 9 p.m. to 12 midnight, instead of allocating a separate speaking time for the agricultural debate as is presently the case. Pursuant to the Rules of Procedure, one speaker may now speak in favour and one against. Mr Pasty has asked for the floor.

Impact of extensive urbanisation in Spain on individual rights of European citizens, on the environment and on the application of EU law (\n- Before the vote\nMichael Cashman\nMr President, I wish to inform the House that, on a matter of principle, I wish to withdraw my name from the Socialist Group's alternative motion for a resolution on the Auken report. Furthermore, after five years of working on this issue, I wish to inform Members that I will be voting against both alternative motions for resolution and voting in favour of the Auken report.\n(Applause)\nMargrete Auken\nrapporteur. - (DA) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, citizens of the EU, this report is the result of extensive work in the Committee on Petitions, involving Members from all political groups. I would like to thank both the Chairman and the shadow rapporteurs for their sterling work. As draftsman of the committee's opinion, I have personally been wholeheartedly committed to this matter. It has, of course, had a huge effect on the lives of tens of thousands of EU citizens living in Spain and has affected both the Spanish countryside and the Spanish economy. The report has now been approved by the committee after being adopted by a two-thirds majority. It is a comprehensive text, which differentiates between the many different aspects of Spanish urbanisation.\nThere is the problem of the fundamental rights of European citizens, which include the right to lawfully acquired property. The European Parliament has already committed itself to respecting these rights, and all Member States are bound by them. There is the problem of the disastrous impact of the extensive urbanisation on the environment, particularly in coastal areas and on the Spanish islands, but also in other areas such as around Madrid. There is the problem of the resurrection of the Spanish 1988 Coastal Law, which is now suddenly able to deny many people the right to live in their own homes - and in certain cases has even resulted in th", "Order of business\nPresident\nThe final draft agenda for this part-session, as laid down by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting on Thursday 3 April 2008 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed. The following amendments have been requested to this draft.\nThursday:\nThe Socialist Group in the European Parliament has requested that the report by Mrs J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki on the Statute of the European Ombudsman be postponed until the next part-session in Strasbourg and that voting time be brought forward to 11 a.m.\nHannes Swoboda\non behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, that is indeed our wish. This is not because the report is a bad one - I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on behalf of my group, too, on a very good report - but there are still one or two critical issues unresolved. We should like to be able to discuss these in peace, which is the reason for our motion; and, as the President has just said, if the House were to agree to it, we could then vote at 11 a.m. - but this is not the reason.\nMr President, for form's sake, I should like to notify my fellow Members on this occasion that I shall also be putting forward a motion - not now, but tomorrow - that the vote on the report on FYROM, or Macedonia, likewise be postponed until the Strasbourg sitting. I shall state the reasons for this tomorrow; I just wanted to let my fellow Members know now. Here, too, there is just one small unresolved issue. This is our group's wish.\nPresident\nWould anyone like to speak in favour of the motion?\nIngo Friedrich\non behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I believe Mr Swoboda's argument was admittedly brief, but it was concise. There are indeed one or two aspects, and therefore I, too, am in favour of postponement.\nPresident\nWho speaks against the motion?\nAndrew Duff\non behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the committee agreed the J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki report to strengthen the powers of the Ombudsman by 19 votes in favour", "Opening of the sitting\nPaul van Buitenen\non behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Mr President, on a point of order, I should like to make a request on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance with regard to tomorrow's debate and vote on Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), or the Gr\u00e4\u00dfle report, in other words. It appears that the Commission is considering ending the present process of reviewing the regulation further to recent revelations about irregularities within OLAF, and would consequently like to withdraw the present proposals in the course of the codecision procedure with Parliament.\nOn behalf of the Group of the Greens, I should like to ask you to check with the Commission to see whether this is the case, and if it would issue a statement before tomorrow's debate, so that the European Parliament knows whether the debate and the vote still have any value.\nPresident\nThe question was addressed to the Commission. Mrs Ferrero-Waldner will have the opportunity to answer it. I welcome Mr Jouyet. We are all here and can start on the next item of business.\n", "13. National restructuring programmes for the cotton sector (\n- Before the vote:\nCharlie McCreevy\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, since the adoption of the new cotton reform by Council in June 2008, much work has been invested in setting up restructuring programmes in the main cotton-producing Member States.\nThis proposal is the Commission's response to the Council's invitation to propose adjustments to the framework for these restructuring programmes. The main modification concerns the possibility of introducing an eight-year, instead of a four-year, programme, which would allow for more substantial restructuring operations.\nThe Commission thanks the rapporteur for the support given to the Commission proposal.\nPresident\nWe are pleased when the Commission praises our work; this should always be the case.\n", "Explanations of vote\nZuzana Roithov\u00e1\n(CS) Mr President, I only want it to be recorded that I voted for Mr Foglietta's report but my voting equipment failed.\nOral explanations of vote\nSimon Busuttil\n(MT) Naturally, it is difficult to be understood in this chaotic situation. I wanted to stand to explain my vote in favour of the resolution we have just passed, that we have just approved, on the annual debate on the progress made in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. Today, the Council of Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs is meeting to discuss and approve the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum. This is a very important subject and it is a very important proposal that is being discussed in the Council, and I hope that, in the discussion being held in the Council today, a declaration on the need to share the burden of immigration more fairly and equally is inserted in the Pact. I hope that the Ministers adopt this Pact today and that it contains reference to this common responsibility.\nFrank Vanhecke\n(NL) Mr President, for many reasons the resolution we have just voted on was unacceptable to me and certainly to my group too. The main reason of course is that I believe Europe absolutely does not need a new, 'illegal' wave of immigration. Absolutely not.\nIt is all too easy for private-sector employers and governments to keep importing more and more foreign nationals from non-EU countries. That causes a brain drain from the developing world to Europe, and ultimately does not benefit either the developing countries or Europe, quite the contrary. We should at long last make a start - and I am looking primarily here to governments and to business and industry - on assimilating, re-educating and integrating into the regular labour market the huge, truly huge numbers of foreign nationals who are already here and who are not and never have been properly absorbed into our society.\nNeena Gill\nMr President, I voted in favour of the Mikko report because I believe the ", "Soil protection (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council by Miroslav Ouzk\u00fd, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on progress in Council on the Framework Directive on Soil Protection - B6-0455/2008).\nMiroslav Ouzk\u00fd\nauthor. - Mr President, let me just stress that in September 2006 the Commission adopted a proposal for a framework directive on soil protection with the aim of protecting soil across the European Union. This proposal resulted in a very lively and interesting discussion in my committee - the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. The rapporteur, Mrs Christina Guti\u00e9rrez-Cortines, worked hard to find a compromise.\nA first-reading position was adopted by the European Parliament on 14 November 2007. Since then it has been unclear when the Council will be able to adopt a common position and when this will be communicated to the European Parliament.\nAt the beginning of June my committee, therefore, put an oral question to the Council to learn more about the progress achieved in the Council since the adoption of Parliament's position. On behalf of my committee, I would like to ask the Council to elaborate on the progress achieved. Furthermore, my committee would like to know when the Council, according to current planning, will be able to communicate its common position on the framework directive on soil protection to the European Parliament.\nNathalie Kosciusko-Morizet\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Ouzk\u00fd, the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community recognises that soil is a limited resource and is a medium that is subjected to environmental constraints. The Programme seeks to define in absolute and unambiguous terms a specific strategy for soil protection that takes into account the principles of subsidiarity and regional diversity, which everyone understands very well.\nIn ", "EU relations with the Gulf Cooperation Council (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Baudis, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on European Union relations with the Gulf Cooperation Council.\nDominique Baudis\nrapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, first of all I should like to stress that this report is the outcome of very constructive work with the political groups and I wish personally to thank Mr Howitt, Mrs Brepoels and Mrs Brantner, as well as Mrs J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki, for their collaboration.\nAs you know, this report relates to the overall strategy in relations between the European Union and the Gulf Cooperation Council.\nOur work started several months ago, so before the events that are now taking place in the Arab world. Since then, we have observed everywhere - including in the Gulf - powerful demonstrations, which are taking place to ask for greater respect of human rights, fundamental freedoms and democracy.\nHowever, right at the beginning of our work, even before the events began, the report - and the amendments adopted in committee - raised all the issues that are behind the uprising. We condemn all forms of discrimination - including those founded on gender or religion - we highlight the issues relating to labour law, social and trade union rights, freedom of conscience, freedom of expression and of opinion, women's rights, the need to reform the justice system, the abolition of the death penalty and of mutilating sentences, and political rights.\nAs the events in Bahrain have unfolded, and faced with the repression of demonstrations, as well as the military intervention of neighbouring countries, members of the GCC, we have prepared, with the shadow rapporteurs, a series of oral amendments that offer support to the demonstrators fighting for freedom. We have highlighted the legitimacy of their demands and condemned the violent reaction by the Bahraini authorities as well as the military intervention of GCC countries that came to", "1. Gender mainstreaming in EU external relations (\n- Before the vote\nLibor Rou\u010dek\nrapporteur. - Mr President, the EU and its Member States have committed themselves to pursuing gender equality and women's empowerment as one of the key priorities of the international agenda.\nYet, closer inspection reveals that the practical implementation of gender mainstreaming in the EU's external policies is still weak. For instance, only eight of the 27 Member States have adopted national action plans on the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325.\nFurthermore, women are still seriously underrepresented in high-level posts in the Commission and the Council. In fact, there is not a single female EU special representative at the moment. For this reason, the report stresses that the EU needs to fully implement its commitments in this field. For instance, the Commission should speed up its work on an EU action plan on gender equality. I am convinced that this is key to strengthening the gender dimension in EU foreign policy.\nLet me conclude by saying that women's rights are part of the broader concept of human and civic rights. Without addressing gender equality and promoting women's rights in the EU's foreign policy, that policy cannot be effective.\n(Applause)\n", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nBalfe\nMr President, my attendance is not recorded even though, as you know, I was here because I sat in the Bureau with you for two hours.\n\nPresident\nThat will be corrected, Mr Balfe.\nThe Minutes were approved\n\nHardstaff\nMr President, I want to draw to your attention the fact that the agriculture debates will be starting in a few minutes. The amendments to two of the reports are still not available in English. I asked for the amendments yesterday evening. One set had appeared by this morning - to the Fantuzzi report - but there are still no copies in English of the amendments to the Jov\u00e9 Peres and Happart reports. It really is not good enough to expect us to debate when we do not have the amendments in our own language.\n\nPresident\nMrs Hardstaff, I have been informed by my services that there was a technical problem. The translations will be circulated as soon as possible.\n\nValdivielso de Cu\u00e9\nMr President, I merely wish to refer to the problems concerning the accessibility of the airports around Strasbourg. Along with many other Members, I am often unable to arrive on time at the start of a sitting. This is because although the city of Strasbourg provides us with a free transfer service, the operators try to make up large groups of passengers, and at times we have had to wait one and a half or two hours for a sufficient number of travellers to arrive. I am grateful to the city of Strasbourg for the service it provides for us free of charge but I do feel, however, that the previous arrangements should be reinstated to ensure a more flexible service. We have been informed of budget cuts, and I appreciate that cost is an important consideration. Nevertheless, if we are truly serious about saving money, we should only come to Strasbourg once or twice a year and meet in Brussels the rest of the time as it is much cheaper. We all enjoy coming to Strasbourg, ", "Need for the Convention on Cluster Munitions to come into effect before the end of 2008 (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council (B6-0481/2008) on the need for the Convention on Cluster Munitions to enter into force before the end of 2008, by Mrs Beer, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Mrs Gomes, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck and Mrs Lynne, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Mr Kristovskis, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, Mr Pfl\u00fcger and Mrs Zimmer, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, and Mr Zappal\u00e0 on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats (O-0110/2008/rev. 1).\nAngelika Beer\nauthor. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 3 December 2008 in Oslo, we will at last reach the point of being able to sign the convention banning cluster munitions. In Dublin, 107 states adopted the convention and promised to sign it. Two weeks before the conference, we would like to call on countries throughout the world to keep their promises, to sign the convention and, above all, to ratify it quickly.\nThe war in the Caucasus and the use of cluster munitions both by Georgia and by Russia, represent a challenge to us. We must not waste any more time. We have high expectations of the European Commission and the Council. We expect all the Member States of the European Union to sign the convention on 3 December, in particular those European states which are still in doubt, that is Greece, Latvia, Poland, Romania and the Republic of Cyprus.\nWe expect that the European Union will continue to campaign for a legally binding ban on cluster munitions as part of the UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW). We unanimously condemn the unbelievable attempt by the USA, Russia and China at the last Ge", "2. EU-Russia Summit (\n- During the vote:\nWerner Langen\n(DE) Mr President, I would like to ask why the Member who is sitting in seat number 56 has voted simultaneously for 56 and 57. Mr B\u00fctikofer has voted on behalf of Mr Turmes. Please reprimand the Member for this behaviour.\n(Uproar)\nIn a previous parliamentary term, when Mr B\u00fctikofer was not yet a Member of Parliament, a penalty was imposed on the chair of a group because he voted on behalf of his neighbour. Mr Cohn-Bendit may find this ridiculous and he may be able to do it within the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance but, however, the rules in Parliament are clear. No Member can vote on behalf of another Member from the other Member's seat. That also applies to the Greens.\n(Loud applause)\nPresident\nLet us move on. It seems to me quite right that you cannot vote on behalf of another person.\n", "Statement by the President-designate of the Commission (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by the President-designate of the Commission.\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are living in unprecedented times. I personally am convinced that the history books of the future will refer to the pre-financial crisis era and the post-financial crisis era. Yet this crisis is not just a financial, economic and social one. It is also a crisis of values. That is why I believe that we must put our European social model, our social market economy, at the heart of our response to this crisis.\nAt the same time, the crisis has shown just how interdependent we have become in this globalised era. There is the financial crisis, but also the energy crisis. There are the food security problems and climate change, an area in which Europe is now the leader. That is why I feel we can say that this is the moment of truth for Europe. Do we want to shape globalisation with our values, by defending our interests, or do we want to suffer globalisation, by following the lead of others?\nFor me, the choice is clear. We must rise to this challenge together because, if we do not do so together, Europe is in danger of being marginalised. We have experience. I do not believe that any another region in the world has the same experience as we have of establishing an internal market, common rules, common institutions, and indeed a single currency and solidarity and cohesion policies. We have this unique experience. I therefore believe that, instead of suffering globalisation, we can shape it, because we are, by nature, a globalisation laboratory; we are the champions of global governance.\nNow is not the time for the status quo, or routine. We must have an agenda for change. Now more than ever we need a strong Europe. With the Treaty of Lisbon, we will be stronger in the future and we will be better able to act.\nWhen I say a stronger Europe, let us be clear what that me", "\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 2\u00a0December 2004. \n\nWith regard to Wednesday\u2019s agenda, in relation to the report by Mr Moscovici on Romania\u2019s progress towards accession (A6-0061/2004), the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has presented a request that we postpone this report until a future sitting. \nFrassoni (Verts/ALE ),\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013 Mr President, on behalf of my group, I should like to point out that we are strongly in favour of Romania\u2019s accession to the European Union. We are, however, opposed to its accession being rushed through without it fully meeting the set criteria. That would be bad both for the credibility of the European Union \u2013 particularly because other enlargements are also being prepared, as we all know \u2013 and for all those people in Romania who are fighting for the rule of law and against corruption, and it would work against the resolution of other serious problems, which have also recently been highlighted by the Commission. That, Mr President, is why we have asked for this vote to be postponed and for a dialogue to be set up with the recently elected members of the Romanian Parliament, so that we can give credibility to a process that would have none if it were automatic and thus utterly pointless. \nSwoboda (PSE ),\n\u00a0\u00a0 .  If I might put it quite briefly, Mrs Frassoni, we are not, this week, voting on Romania\u2019s accession, but on the report, which has a number of favourable things to say, and a number of negative ones too. We believe that we have to show Romania \u2013 right now, at a time when things are at a critical point \u2013 the way it has to go in the coming weeks, months, and perhaps years if it is to be able to accede. That is why we are in favour of the debate and, ultimately, the vote on Romania happening this week. So, speaking on behalf of my group, I want to express opposition to this contribution being deferred. \n\nAlso in relation to the Wednesday sitting, there is a proposed chang", "Fundamental rights in the European Union (2009) - Effective implementation after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs G\u00e1l, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union (2009) - effective implementation after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.\nKinga G\u00e1l\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon brought with it the vision and idea of a strong Europe in respect of Community powers. To the citizens, it offers the promise of the fulfilment of this vision. This also applies to the protection of fundamental rights, and therefore, in contrast to previous years, this year's report deals with these new legal bases and with the strengthened and newly established powers and institutions, and provides a close examination of the situation thus created. The aim of the report is to offer a new and comprehensive approach in the protection of fundamental rights.\nSince December 2009, the protection of fundamental human rights has rested on multiple pillars within the European Union. On one hand, it is based on the Treaty of Lisbon, and on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which has now become legally binding. The Charter has become a standard for the creation and application of EU laws by both the EU institutions and by the Member States. A similar pillar of the Community legal system will be our accession to the European Convention on Human Rights, a process that is currently under way, but the system of human rights guarantees enshrined in the Member States' own legal systems will remain a similar pillar. These legal bases will also be reinforced by the established Community institutions, both at Community and Member State level. At Community level, I would like to mention the Commission, the portfolio of the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights, the Council working group, Parliament, and of ", "3. Financing of the Special Court for Sierra Leone\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution on the financing of the Special Court for Sierra Leone.\nI should point out that some of our colleagues are currently in Sierra Leone to monitor the elections there.\nJ\u00f3zef Pinior  \nauthor. - (PL) Mr President, the development of international humanitarian law, together with the establishment of courts to try perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity represented a mayor achievement by the international community after the Second World War. The role of the aforementioned institutions has developed further in the era of globalisation, especially in areas where national leaders are unable to establish a central authority around governments based on the rule of law and ensure the fundamental security of the inhabitants concerned.\nThe Special Court for Sierra Leone is making a significant contribution to the cause of peace and justice in the Mano River region of West Africa. I should like to highlight the programme undertaken by the Court involving the archiving and translation of documents relating to its work. I should also like to mention the victim protection programmes it has set up. Activities of this nature are crucial to the establishment of governments based on the rule of law in West Africa in the longer term.\nIn today's resolution on the financing of the Special Court for Sierra Leone the European Parliament is calling on the Commission and on all European and Member State institutions to guarantee the financial basis to enable the Court to complete its work in a measured and responsible manner.\nRyszard Czarnecki  \nauthor. - (PL) Mr President, it so happens that the next round of parliamentary elections is due to take place in Sierra Leone this coming weekend. I cannot but express my regret that the European Parliament delegation previously planned will not be present there.\nWe might well ask ourselves why the Special Court for Si", "Broad economic policy guidelines (2003-2005)\nPresident.\nThe next item is the debate on the report (A5-0142/2003) by Mr Garc\u00eda-Margallo y Marfil, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission Recommendation on the Broad Guidelines of the Economic Policies of the Member States and the Community for 2003-2005(COM(2003) 170 - C5-0189/2003 - 2003/2074(INI)).\nGarc\u00eda-Margallo y Marfil (PPE-DE)\nMr President, I would like to start by explaining exactly what we are discussing. We are dealing with the economic guidelines, and in my view, there are three novel aspects to them. Firstly, they are economic guidelines for three years, not just for one year. Secondly, they will be discussed alongside the employment guidelines. Thirdly, we are holding these discussions at a time of recession. We have learnt this morning that the most powerful economy in the European Union has entered into recession. These are therefore no ordinary economic guidelines.\nGiven these circumstances the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and myself in particular, were requested to draft a report promptly to allow the Commission and the Council to study it. We were asked to try and arrive at the broadest possible consensus. We have achieved this. All the groups had to make compromises but we did manage to reach an agreement. I should like to take this opportunity of highlighting the splendid work of the spokespersons for the various groups. Othmar Karas spoke on behalf of my group, Robert Goebbels spoke on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists and Carles-Alfred Gas\u00f2liba i B\u00f6hm spoke on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.\nI would also like to say to the Commission that whenever Parliament has been invited to respond, the response has invariably been helpful. As suggested in the Poem of the Cid, a servant will always respond well to a good master. I urge you to bear this in mind and to involve Parliament in the disc", "\nWuermeling\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning I take great pleasure in conveying a message of thanks to you this morning. Last week in Prague I had the opportunity of meeting Mr Ivan Pilip, a Member of the Czech Parliament. Mr Pilip was detained for 26 days in a Cuban jail for having established links with dissidents. He is now back in the Czech Republic, is in good spirits and thanks the President and also the Members of the European Parliament for their efforts towards his release. Mr Pilip remarked that the Czech public also felt great satisfaction in the friendship forged for his benefit between the European Parliament and the Czech state and Czech members of parliament. He is convinced that our intervention in particular played a significant role in securing his release. I would like to make it clear that I personally played very little part in this process so I am all the more delighted to be able to pass on his thanks.\n\nPresident\n Thank you, Mr Wuermeling.\n\nAir strikes in Iraq\nPresident\nThe next item is the statements by the Council and Commission on air strikes in Iraq.\n\nDanielsson\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome this opportunity to comment on a topical and important issue. On Friday 16 February, as we all know, American and British warplanes attacked military targets outside Baghdad. As we also know, the background to these attacks was said to be an increase in Iraqi anti-aircraft fire aimed at the British and American war planes patrolling what are known as the no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq. The Americans and the British have made statements emphasising that the actions were taken in self-defence, as well as the fact that they were routine and must not be seen as an escalation of, or change to, the policy. We also know that several countries have been critical of the actions.\nThe UN Security Council briefly discussed this issue in informal consultations on 20 February when statements were also made reflecting expec", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 14 June 2001.\n\nMembership of political groups\nPresident\nI would like to inform you that, with effect from today, 2 July 2001, Mr Holmes will no longer be a member of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities. He will now sit with the Non-attached Members.\nI would also like to announce that, pursuant to Rule 7(2) of the Rules of Procedure, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has carried out a verification of credentials regarding Mrs Olga Zrihen Zaari and Mr Miguel Mayol i Raynal. I therefore propose to confirm these mandates.\n\nMcMillan-Scott\nI note that Mr Holmes is leader of the UK Independence Party. I wonder whether that means that the UK Independence Party is now transferring in its entirety, or at least the two Members who are present here, to the other group.\n\nPresident\nI only have information about Mr Holmes.\n\nAgenda\nPresident\nThe next item is the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 28 June 2001.\nRelating to Wednesday:\n\nPosselt\nMadam President, I am sorry that I keep on having to repeat myself on the subject of Wednesdays, but the same deplorable state of affairs still exists. As I see it, question time has again been deferred and shortened. Every time I protest, I am told that this is exceptional. The exception is now slowly becoming the norm because, by foolishly abolishing the Friday sittings, we have overloaded the Wednesday ones. I would therefore ask you to ensure that, independently of the Friday issue - which we cannot now resolve -Wednesdays come fully into their own again. In other words, a full one and a half hours should be set aside for question time, for the right to ask questions is a fundamental right of every parliamentarian.\n\nPresident\nMr Posselt, I promise you that this will be the last time.\n\nUnless the chairs of the groups dec", "Patients' rights in cross-border healthcare (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by John Bowis, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the application of patients' rights in cross-border health care - C6-0257/2008 -.\nAs many of you know, John Bowis was taken ill recently in Brussels and was hospitalised. He had an operation, which I am pleased to say was a success, and he is now recovering, so he is an example of cross-border health care. His place is taken today by my friend and colleague, Philip Bushill-Matthews.\nPhilip Bushill-Matthews\nrapporteur. - Mr President, I have a very difficult task and a very easy task. It is very difficult because this dossier is very complicated and very sensitive, and it is a dossier on which, personally, I have done very little work. It is very easy because it is a report by my distinguished colleague, John Bowis, who, as you say, is currently recovering from major heart surgery, undertaken a couple of weeks ago in Brussels.\nHe has done an amazing job in bringing this dossier to such a successful conclusion today and, indeed, in laying the foundations for this success in his original report on patient mobility way back in June 2005. I am sure he would also wish me to thank the Commissioner personally for her support, to thank the shadow rapporteurs and to thank our group secretariat, and indeed his own research assistant, for the huge efforts they have all made to secure broad agreement on so many of the controversial issues. With their help, John has sought to shed light on what has been a very murky area, and to bring clarity where uncertainty prevailed before, based consistently on the twin principles that the patient must always come first and that patient choice should be determined by needs and not by means.\nFor the last 10 years, European citizens have been going to the courts to fight for their r", "\nBuitenweg\nMadam President, the Austrian political scientist and professor, Anton Pelinka, has been prosecuted following a comment he made about Mr Haider. Mr Pelinka was member of the committee of the European Observatory for Racism and Xenophobia in Vienna. According to treaty obligations, he should be receiving support from the Austrian Government, but despite repeated requests, he has received inadequate support in terms of infrastructure. In a press release, Mr Sch\u00fcssel stated that, in the light of these experiences, the treaty stipulations are pitched far too high. Mr Pelinka resigned because he felt unsupported by the government and was replaced by a member of one of the parties in government.\nI know that the President has always been very committed to the issue of combating racism and xenophobia. I was there when she gave her speech in Vienna to mark the opening of the Observatory. We are also responsible for the functioning of the European institutions. I would like to ask you whether you are prepared to write a letter or contact the Austrian Government to express your concern about the restriction of the freedom of expression and to point out the obligations which the government has in this respect and which it cannot escape unilaterally.\n\nPresident\nThank you, Mrs Buitenweg. We are investigating the matter you have just told us about very carefully.\n\nVan der Laan\nMadam President, yesterday, the European Parliament decided by democratic majority no longer to convene in Strasbourg on Fridays. You subsequently issued a press release in which you expressed your regret about this. You have, of course, every right to do so. Everyone has their own personal and political responsibility. It is, however, somewhat confusing if the President of the European Parliament expresses regret regarding one of Parliament' s democratic decisions and if she does so on Parliament' s official letter-headed paper, with a reference to the services of Parliament. I would ask you not ", "16. EU-United States Summit (vote) \n- Before the vote on Amendment 5:\nJan Marinus Wiersma\nMr President, we would like to make the amendment somewhat more balanced by adding at the end of this amendment: 'stresses at the same time the necessity to improve the procedures relating to the EU's black list'.\n(The oral amendment was accepted)\n", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nIvo Strej\u010dek\n(CS) I would like to explain my vote concerning Mr Karas's report on the quality of statistical data. The report has a whole range of very good points, of course, but I abstained from voting because I do not share the rapporteur's view that Eurostat should have a dominant right to interfere, without any form of advance notice, in the exercising of the rights of national statistical authorities.\nDaniel Hannan\nMr President, it has become a journalistic clich\u00e9 to talk about the events in Greece as a tragedy, but I think we can fairly define them as a tragedy in the classic Sophoclean sense. We had the hubris of the boom years when we pretended that Greek and German debt were interchangeable. Now we have the nemesis of the overdue market correction.\nBut the catharsis has been artificially stayed. Rather than allowing a natural market correction, which is to say, Greece minting its own currency and pricing itself back into the European markets, we are instead pursuing this policy of pretending that better statistics or more regional aid or more shifting around of money through sales taxes or European debt agencies will somehow postpone the inevitable.\nIn fact, what we are doing is condemning the people of Greece and - I hope I am wrong - possibly the people of the other Mediterranean countries to years of recession, stagnation and unemployment - but we are at least generating employment for ourselves because we are justifying our own existence. Thus we see the true purpose of the European Union, namely, the employment of its own employees.\nSyed Kamall\nMr President, when one looks back at the quality of statistical data for some Member States - when it was quite clear that they were cooking the books and did not provide an accurate reflection of the state of the national economy - I can understand the call for better statistical data. I think we can all understand that there should be better data collection as re", "Development impact of Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) (short presentation) \nPresident\n- The next item is a short presentation of the report by Mr Schr\u00f6der, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the development impact of Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs).\nJ\u00fcrgen Schr\u00f6der\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about the impact of economic partnership agreements on development. 'Economic partnership agreements' really is quite a mouthful, particularly in German. It is a horrible phrase, and no doubt very few people in Germany will concern themselves with this topic, despite the fact that it will be one of the most important topics in coming years. What is it all about?\nThe Cotonou Agreement states that economic partnership agreements should be concluded between the European Union and the ACP (African, Caribbean Pacific) States by the end of 2007. The background to this was that developing countries that were not, and are not, in the ACP Group of States complained to the World Trade Organization (WTO) that the European Union was according the ACP States special privileges.\nWe have now managed to set up, at least in part of the Caribbean, an economic partnership agreement of this type, which we hope will be a success. My report states that this agreement will form a new basis for development cooperation: we are helping them to help themselves. We are trying to link together trade and development, by which I mean trade policy and development policy. There has, of course, been a certain amount of friction, in particular here in Parliament between our committee, the Committee on Regional Development, and the Committee on International Trade, relating primarily to the compatibility of this agreement with the rules of the WTO and especially the issue of parliamentary scrutiny.\nMy report originally included two paragraphs - numbers 5 and 17 - relating to parliamentary scrutiny. At the request and on the advice of the chairman of th", "11. Preparation of 2012 budget (\nJ\u00fcrgen Klute\n(DE) Mr President, I just wanted to provide a brief explanation.

In paragraph 248, the words 'Kozloduy blocks 1 to 4' should be added after 'at the Kozloduy nuclear power station'.\nPresident\nAll these comments will be checked for accuracy.\nBogus\u0142aw Liberadzki\nrapporteur. - Mr President, I was unable to reach Strasbourg and so I thank you very much on behalf of my colleagues who contributed to the debate. I was pleased that the Council was represented, as the discharge process is one which concerns not only the EU institutions, but also the Member States, which the Council represents.\nThe real meat of my report is the number of proposals that aim to reduce error rates, to pinpoint problems and to improve the matching of information from the Commission and from the Court of Auditors, allowing us all in future to identify and tackle the real problem areas in our expenditure. With the Lisbon Treaty in place, it is time for a review of the discharge process itself.\nMy report calls for a higher-level debate involving the EU institutions and, of course, the Member States, which are responsible for managing around 80% of expenditure. Although my report is about the 2008 discharge, it contains many issues that are highly topical today. We all want to make sure that Greece can overcome the problems from the past. The section on Turkey has attracted attention and, whilst we must ensure pre-accession funds are used more effectively, let me stress that we are not about to change the nature of the EU's relationship with that country.\nAll the improvements I have highlighted are essential. The current financial difficulties mean that every euro must be used wisely and bring benefits to the people across our various countries - including the euros in the Structural and Cohesion Funds.\nI look forward to working with the Commission and the Court of Auditors over the coming weeks to bring the", "36. Biomass and Biofuels (vote) \n- Before the vote on paragraph 76:\nMechtild Rothe\n(DE) Mr President, we would like to propose a brief amendment at this point, namely in the middle of the paragraph, 'as part of the energy package for 2007'.\n(The oral amendment was accepted)\nPresident\nThat concludes the vote.\n", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nSturdy\nMr President, I would like to draw your attention to the Agenda. Yesterday the Agenda stated quite clearly that after Urgencies, voting starts at 5.30 p.m. As Members are now going to be electronically tagged as from February, I would very much suggest that this House tries to bring some discipline into voting time. A lot of Members had to leave yesterday at 6 p.m. when voting should have finished. Therefore I would ask that in future we start to try to keep some discipline about time.\n\nPresident\nThank you very much, Mr Sturdy, but your comments do not refer to the Minutes.\nHowever, we will take note of the comments and forward them to the Committee.\n\nHardstaff\nMr President, my name does not appear on the list of Members present yesterday, although I do appear on every list of recorded votes. I would be grateful if that could be put right.\n\nPresident\nThank you, Mrs Hardstaff. You are right. The corresponding Minutes will be put right.\n\nPasty\nMr President, that also applies to me. My name is not shown, although I took part in every vote and attended the Conference of Presidents.\n\nPresident\nThank you very much, Mr Pasty. I repeat what I have already said to Mrs Hardstaff.

Control of the acquisition and possession of weapons (vote) \n- Report: Gisela Kallenbach\n- Before the vote\nGisela Kallenbach\n(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regard it as a remarkable success that this compromise between the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the Council and the Commission has enabled us to achieve a result at first reading on the sensitive issue of the acquisition and possession of firearms. I would like to express my sincere thanks to everyone involved.\n- After the vote\nArlene McCarthy\nMr President, Mr R\u00fcbig has accused me twice now of bringing a firearm into the Chamber. I want to clarify that this was agreed to by the security services, and the presidency was aware of it.\nUp until this vote it was not a firearm. Now that the House has voted that it is a firearm, I am prepared to hand it over to the authorities!\nPresident\nI think the only weapon we have here is the strength of our convictions.\n", "The placing on the market and use of feed for animals (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the placing on the market and use of animal feed - C6-0128/2008 -.\nFriedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf\nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, today we are discussing what is known as the 'open declaration'. This is about transparency with regard to feed as the basis for healthy food for consumers, and it is about giving purchasers of compound feed an overview of what is supplied to them.\nIt has been a long road but, if we adopt this Regulation today, I hope this brings matters to a successful conclusion, and I should like to thank the Commission, which has helped us a great deal with its constructive work on the issues. The Commission encountered absolute political will on the part of Parliament to push through this open declaration, and also experienced a stubborn but fair debate with the Council. We can be proud of the results.\nLet us take a brief look at the history. We had the BSE crisis and, in 1997, the Temporary Committee of Inquiry issued its final report in which Parliament called for this open declaration. The Commission presented a proposal, which subsequently became Directive 2002/2/EC. In a compromise with the Council - this went through all the bodies - the Directive pushed through the open declaration, which meant that labels had to state the ingredients with a \u00b1 15% tolerance, and the exact composition had to be provided on request.\nThat was a directive rather than a regulation, and Member States implemented it only very hesitantly or not at all. The feed industry brought an action to the European Court of Justice, and the Court gave the following first-class confirmation: apart from the exact information, the legality of this Directive was not in dispute. We then too", "Statute for a European private company - Cross-borders transfers of companies' registered offices - Small Business Act - Workers' participation in companies with a European Statute (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on:\nthe report by Mr Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the Statute for a European private company - C6-0283/2008 -.\nthe report by Mr Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, with recommendations to the Commission on the cross-border transfer of the registered office of a company.\nthe report by Mrs Herczog, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the Small Business Act.\nthe Commission statement on workers' participation in companies with a European Statute.\nKlaus-Heiner Lehne\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have two reports to advocate here, both of which originate from Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs.\nI should like to start with the one that is more important at this time, as it concerns a specific legislative procedure initiated by the Commission: the European private company (EPC). Indeed, this is the legislative core element, if one may describe it thus, of the Small Business Act.\nI wish to say a few words about the background. The idea for the European private company was already contained in Commissioner Bolkestein's Action Plan on Company Law. For reasons that never made sense to me, the idea of the European private company was then erased, so to speak, from the action plan over the years, in the course of this Commission's term of office, and was not pursued further by the Commission at that time.\nThe European Parliament disagreed, however, and this was the background to its legislative own-initiative report under Rule 39 of the Rules of Procedure and Article 192 of the Treaty, which this House adopted by an overwhelming majority some time ago. Under these circumstances, the Commission felt compelled to reconsider the i", "Emission performance standards for new passenger cars (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Sacconi, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council setting emission performance standards for new passenger cars as part of the Community's integrated approach to reduce CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles - C6-0022/2008 -.\nGuido Sacconi\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have 'saved the best for last', as they say. This report was the first to be finished, exactly two weeks ago, and strangely enough it is the last to be debated.\nFirst of all and quite sincerely I must thank everyone who has worked on this report, particularly the delegation, among many, from the French Presidency. I too would like to mention Mr L\u00e9glise-Costa, who led this initiative with great professionalism. Together we have found an intelligent solution to the issue, at perhaps the most difficult time imaginable, that is to say when the motor industry is in the throes of an appalling crisis.\nOn close examination, this result was by no means a foregone conclusion, not least considering how this report's journey began, with all the controversy when the Commission adopted the corresponding proposal last December. Yet we have succeeded not only in seeing it through, but also in achieving three things at once: we have stepped up our efforts, enhanced our strategy and introduced greater flexibility.\nI say we have stepped up our efforts because, as you know, the priority proposed by Parliament has been agreed; that is to say, a long-term reduction target has been included, of 95 grams of CO2 per kilometre by 2020. This is obviously important because it brings this sector into line with others covered by other legislative instruments such as the emissions trading scheme, but also, and above all, because it allows companies to plan their investment, innovation and research accor", "Toy Safety (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on toy safety.\nMeglena Kuneva\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament for its continued interest in product safety issues, and for this opportunity to give you a short presentation on the first results of the product safety stocktaking, released on 22 November 2007. I attended the IMCO Committee meeting on 26 November and I am now pleased to address the European Parliament meeting in plenary.\nMy three starting points and principles are still valid and can be confirmed: there can be no compromise on consumer safety; we believe in open markets and fair competition; and we want to work in international partnership with the Chinese and the Americans.\nThese stocktaking results indicate that the regulatory framework is fit for the purpose, if and when it is properly applied. In particular, the rapid alert system RAPEX is working efficiently and ensuring that dangerous products are recalled from the market throughout the European Union.\nThe stocktaking report nonetheless identifies certain scope for improvements, in preventive actions and international cooperation as well as in enhanced enforcement.\nSome envisaged improvements are already at an advanced stage towards becoming concrete actions, as is notably the case of the revision of the Toy Safety Directive.\nI intend to propose to my colleagues in the Commission that we adopt a temporary measure to require that warnings be given on magnetic toys, pending revision of the standard, to address the risks that these toys could pose. We have this right under Article 13 of the General Product Safety Directive. I hope that this measure will become effective soon, but I am also aware that it is just a partial stop-gap solution until the relevant standard addresses the risk associated with magnets comprehensively.\nThe Commission is assisting the Member States' market surveillance authorities to identify and share best practi", "Voting time (continued) \nPresident\nBefore the vote, we will hear speeches from the chairs of the political groups on the election of the new Commission.\nJoseph Daul\nMr President, Mr L\u00f3pez Garrido, President of the Commission, thank you for giving me the opportunity to say why I firmly believe, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), that Mr Barroso and his College of Commissioners, assisted by members of staff from the Commission, will be equal to the challenges that they face.\nEurope was born of an international crisis and, for the first time in 60 years, it is facing a new international crisis that is of a different type but that is undoubtedly serious and dangerous. It is overcoming it, although we are not yet out of the woods. The euro has done its job as a monetary shield; there will never be enough words to say how much we owe it: the automatic stabilisers, those famous solidarity mechanisms, which are too ... You have benefited a great deal from them, my friends!\n(Applause)\nWhere would you be now without the solidarity stabilisers? Too often they have been regarded as a burden weighing down our economies, but they have done a great deal to keep the European model afloat. An attractive, much-copied model to which our fellow citizens are rightly attached, but which is being called into question by new challenges.\nThe world has become multipolar, but not in the way we dreamed; we dreamed that it would be idealistic, peaceful and multilateral. No, the world has become one of competition, of a struggle - a peaceful one, certainly, but a fierce one - to impose one's model on the others.\nIn the face of this challenge, the Union, which has so many tools at its disposal, must not waste them. It must remain true to itself, by embracing ideas and people, and by pioneering the fight against global warming, but it must also arm itself with the resources to compete.\nThat is, I know, what the new Commission is going to strive to achieve ", "Iceland's application for membership of the European Union (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on Iceland's application for membership of the EU.\nSteven Vanackere\nMadam President, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to have the opportunity today to address a few words to the plenary sitting of the European Parliament on behalf of the Presidency of the European Union and to present to you our plans for the accession negotiations with Iceland, a country with which we have all become more familiar in recent months because of the volcano Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull. My apologies to the interpreters for forcing them to pronounce this tongue twister.\nFirst of all, I should like to emphasise, as you have also pointed out in your most recent resolution on the enlargement strategy, that enlargement has been a success story for the EU and for Europe as a whole and that it has brought benefits to both long-standing and new Member States. The enlargement process will continue to contribute to peace, democracy and stability on the European continent. It gives the EU greater weight in the world and also yields concrete benefits for our citizens, amongst other things, in the form of greater prosperity, better prospects for economic growth and new opportunities for cooperation, for instance, as regards transport, energy and many other areas.\nBuilding on the progress made by previous Presidencies and in line with the renewed consensus on enlargement, which is contained in the conclusions of the European Council of December 2006, and with the programme of the Council Presidency trio, the Belgian Presidency will continue with these activities. Perhaps I should point out that steering enlargement in the right direction is one of the five priority axes of the Belgian Presidency.\nThe European Council of 17 June welcomed the Commission Opinion on Iceland's application for membership of the European Union and the recommendation that acces", "Order of business\nPresident\nThe final version of the draft agenda for this part-session, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 17 January 2008, pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed. The following amendments have been proposed:\nBrussels part-session:\nAt the request of the GUE/NGL Group and with the consent of all groups, I propose that statements on the situation in Gaza by Mr Javier Solana, High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, who is already with us and to whom I bid a very warm welcome, and by the Commission be added to today's agenda as item 2, following the statements on the situation in Iran.\n(Parliament approved the request.)\nThere is also a request that we conclude the debate with the tabling of motions for resolutions and vote on these during the February part-session.\nFrancis Wurtz\non behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, my group has proposed a debate on this for the same reasons as we have proposed that there should be a resolution in February. It is in order to have an opportunity to listen to Mr Solana and for Parliament then to explain its own position, for three reasons.\nThe first is, of course, the issue of the Gaza blockade, which seems to us a collective punishment that is totally unacceptable from the humanitarian point of view, counter-productive politically and ineffective as far as the security of Israel is concerned. The second reason is the new situation since the people of Gaza have opened up the border. Thirdly, and above all, the European response to the question of what we can do to ensure that this opening up continues in a controlled and stable way and to make this step forward part of the peace process as a whole.\nI think it would be useful now to hear what Mr Solana has to say and to debate the issue and wind up the debate with a resolution in February.\n(Parliament adopted the motion.)\n(The amended order of business was ado", "Announcement by the President\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, the Conference of Presidents has asked me to issue a statement in this connection and I can say, quite categorically, that there will be no debate or discussions on this matter. No speeches will be accepted.\nThe Conference of Presidents has instructed me to provide you with the wording of a press release issued yesterday by the President of Parliament and to make an additional comment in relation to this statement.\nBy a very large majority, the Conference of Presidents adopted the content of a press release which the President of the European Parliament issued yesterday on the issue of Mr Bronis\u0142aw Geremek's mandate. Yesterday's press release reads as follows:\n'The European Parliament has not, as yet, received any communication from the Polish authorities concerning Mr Geremek's mandate: Bronis\u0142aw Geremek is a politician of high standing who has always supported democracy in his own country and European integration. We will examine all legal avenues to ensure that Mr Bronis\u0142aw Geremek may continue his work.'\n(Loud applause)\nMy statement from yesterday continues as follows: 'According to our information, the Constitutional Court in Poland is currently also investigating the questionable law on which the withdrawal of Mr Geremek's mandate is based. A decision by the court is expected over the next week. I have commissioned the European Parliament's legal service to check the exact legal position. This topic will also be discussed tomorrow by the Conference of Presidents.'\nLadies and gentlemen, this has just happened and the Conference of Presidents conveys its sympathy and solidarity to our fellow Member, Mr Bronis\u0142aw Geremek.\n(Loud applause)\n", "Preparation for the European Council meeting (4 February 2011) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on preparation for the European Council meeting of 4 February 2011. The first to speak will be Mrs Gy\u0151ri, President-in-Office of the Council, on behalf of the Council. Please take the floor.\nEnik\u0151 Gy\u0151ri\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I am very happy to be able to speak to you before the next meeting of the European Council, even though the role of the presidency-in-office is defined by the Treaty of Lisbon in such a way that the preparation of meetings of the European Council is primarily the responsibility of the permanent President. However, the presidency-in-office has cooperated very closely with the permanent President in preparing the meeting of the European Commission, for example in the case of the General Affairs Council held on Monday during the Hungarian Presidency. Furthermore, we are naturally monitoring the implementation of the European Council's conclusions, both in the General Affairs Council and in other Council configurations.\nAllow me to first give an outline of the major issues on the agenda of the February meeting, which primarily focus on energy and innovation. While determining the Europe 2020 strategy, the European Council decided in March 2010 to hold a thematic debate on the issue of energy and innovation. I believe I do not need to point out how extremely important these two sectors are for European economic growth and employment. That is because the task of the European Council is not only to respond to direct crisis situations, but also to formulate strategic guidelines for the future.\nLet us begin with the matter of energy. Energy security is a priority for all of us. This requires a greater degree of integration and interconnection of the energy market. We must increase research and development expenditure, make the economy mor", "\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 4 December 2003.(1) \n\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The final draft agenda as drawn up pursuant to Rules 110 and 110a of the Rules of Procedure by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 11 December 2003 has been distributed.\nI have received no requests for changes. \nPapayannakis (GUE/NGL ).\n\u00a0\u00a0  Mr President, I am not exactly sure if I am on the order of business. However, I should like to ask, if possible, for the vote on the directive on environmental liability which we are debating tonight not to be held at noon tomorrow but for it to be held at noon on Wednesday. I know very well, both from my group and from other political groups, that they are still discussing various issues relating to the vote, how it is organised, and so on.\nThe deadlines were abysmal. So, if there is no major problem, I would be most grateful if the vote could be held at noon on Wednesday. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The problem is, Mr Papayannakis, that under the Rules of Procedure, the services must receive requests for changes to the order of business at least one hour before the opening of the sitting. No such request has been received, and so, if I follow the Rules, I should dismiss your request. Are there any other comments on this matter? \nSwoboda (PSE ).\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013 Mr President, although this may have been formally incorrect, I have to assume that an agreement has been reached that the vote will indeed be deferred. The groups thought that we could attempt to resolve the problem \u2013 or problems \u2013 in good time, so that we could keep to the original timetable, but it has turned out in the meantime that these attempts have \u2013 so far at least \u2013 proved fruitless. In that case, we too on our side of the House could support this if you regard it as feasible. \nHarbour (PPE-DE ).\n\u00a0\u00a0  Mr President, I must draw the attention of this House to the fact that this is a major codecision text in second reading, for which we re", "Regulation of trading in financial instruments - 'dark pools', etc. (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Swinburne, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on regulation of trading in financial instruments - dark pools, etc. (2010/2075 (INI)).\nKay Swinburne\nrapporteur. - Mr President, I have difficulty explaining to those uninitiated in financial jargon precisely what my report on 'dark pools' refers to. The report formally refers to the trading of financial instruments, including dark pools, which are financial transactions and shares conducted without pre-trade transparency, otherwise referred to as non-displayed trades. The report, more broadly, is an assessment of the implementation of the Markets in the Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) of 2007 with respect to equities and seeks to address structural issues currently apparent in the equities markets.\nDespite this being a highly technical report, I am encouraged by the high level of debate that has occurred in the committee. I am glad that the hard work of my colleagues has managed to establish a broad base of support across political groups, turning 194 amendments into 26 compromises, which most groups were able to sign up to.\nGiven the timing of this own-initiative report and its culmination in a plenary vote this week, I also believe that the European Parliament has added significantly to the Commission's recently released consultation on the MiFID II review (MiFID II), which takes into account many of the issues raised in deliberations in the committee. The European Parliament, through this report, has asked for a number of investigations into the different trading venues that are currently regulated under MiFID and seeks a closer analysis to ensure that venues providing equivalent services are regulated to an equivalent level.\nI believe that the Commission, in their consultation document, may have gone a step further in widening its definition of orga", "Recovery of Community funds (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Paulo Casaca, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the recovery of Community funds.\nPaulo Casaca \nrapporteur. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, if we are to recover the amounts missing from the Community budget, what is needed is suitable determination, paperwork, transparency, stringency, proportionality and harmonisation of the rules and procedures. Sadly, we are a long way off achieving that.\nThe European institutions must not shut themselves away in a world of rules and regulations, far removed from reality. For this reason, this report on the recovery of Community funds takes as its starting point a specific example: never before have we had a bigger sum to recover - it is put at almost EUR 100 million - and the circumstances surrounding the missing money are worse still.\nThis concerns a crime perpetrated by a criminal organisation that has enjoyed the collusion of any number of European companies, and, following the investigation and cooperation on the part of the Italian authorities, the European bodies were notified of the details of the case. The Guardia de finanzia held an investigation into the illegal import of butter by firms controlled by the Naples Camorra, the adulteration of that butter with unrendered beef fat, vegetable oils and a chemical known as lipostrol, the sale of tens of thousands of tonnes of the finished product to various European companies and lastly the use of this product for the fraudulent use of export refunds and disposal subsidies for pastry goods. The findings of this investigation were then passed on to the relevant Community and national authorities.\nSeven years after the Italian investigation, and what has happened? In one of the Member States concerned, the authorities only decided to launch an inquiry four years after the original Italian report came out, and none of the estimated missing EUR 40 million has been recovered. In anot", "Third country nationals subject to or exempt from a visa requirement when crossing external borders (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Tanja Fajon, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement - C7-0112/2009 -.\nTanja Fajon\nMadam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Barrot, and all of you attending here today, the European Parliament firmly supports the abolition of the visa regime for all the countries of the Western Balkans. That is also the core idea that has guided us throughout the preparation of the report. I would like to express my compliments, in particular, to the shadow rapporteurs and members of Parliament, as without their support I would not have been able to achieve this result. Likewise, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission for their collaborative efforts which will form the firm bedrock of future cooperation in this area, especially once the Treaty of Lisbon has been ratified, as that will enable Parliament to adopt any necessary measures through the codecision procedure.\nThe citizens of the Western Balkans have been isolated by the visa regime for far too long. They have fewer rights today, as regards free travel, than they did in the days of the former Yugoslavia. What young people from the countries of the Western Balkans know about Europe, or America for that matter, today is what they learn from the internet and television. As I come from Slovenia, I can recall that it was actually the Slovene Presidency which initiated the process of visa regime liberalisation in early 2008, five years after the signing of the Thessaloniki Agenda, which guarantees an unambiguous European perspective for the population of the Western Balkans.\nI am please", "Question Time (Council) \nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B6-0227/09).\nThe following questions are addressed to the Council.\nSubject: Anti-Lisbon rhetoric\nThe global financial crisis has shown us just how imperative it is to have a strong European Union. We have learnt quickly in Ireland that myths and disinformation about the Lisbon Treaty will be small comfort in a shrinking economy and with rising unemployment. With the EU Presidency held by the Czech Republic, and the country's own President espousing anti-Lisbon rhetoric, how does the Council intend to reconcile these messages with the patent need for greater, rather than less, EU cooperation?\nPetr Ne\u010das\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has always made plain its determination to strengthen cooperation within the EU, particularly in times of crisis. The Czech Presidency, following on from the activities of its predecessor, is working hard to resolve the problems caused by the current financial and economic crisis and in this context has adopted measures at various levels. It has established a joint framework for Member States, as can be seen for example from the bank rescue plan, the European economic recovery plan, the regulation and supervision of financial markets. The European Parliament has also contributed to these measures by supporting investment in infrastructure, and not least through its efforts on the international scene. The Council at its meeting of 19 and 20 March focused on overcoming the financial crisis and the problems of the real economy and made it very clear that Europe can confront these problems and stop the current crisis only through unified and coordinated action within the framework of the single market and economic and monetary union. The Council decided at its meeting on 19 March that a closely coordinated EU response within the framework of the European economic recovery plan should mobilise all available instrum", "Statements by the President\nPresident\nOne week ago today, on 26 November, a dramatic series of coordinated terrorist attacks took place in Mumbai in India. According to the Indian Interior Ministry, almost 190 people lost their lives, 22 of them foreigners, as a result of these terrible attacks. 200 people were injured in these attacks and it is still uncertain whether many of them will live.\nOn behalf of the European Parliament, I should like to voice my outrage at this monstrous attack on innocent people and to express our deepest sympathy with the families of all those who have died.\nI should also like to assure those injured in the attacks and their families of our support and our heartfelt sympathy.\nThe European Parliament utterly condemns these terrorist acts and would like to manifest its solidarity with India, its people and its authorities in this time of mourning. Today we are all Indians at heart.\nTerrorism is a direct attack on freedom, human rights and democracy. Terrorism is the attempt to destroy our values by means of indiscriminate violence - values which unite us in the European Union and in our Member States.\nLadies and gentlemen, you know that a delegation of the Committee on International Trade from the European Parliament was in Mumbai at precisely the time of the attacks.\nIn the midst of all the mourning over the tragic attacks, we would nevertheless like to express our joy and relief that all the participants of this parliamentary delegation trip are with us again safe and sound because some of the members of the delegation of the European Parliament were in the hotels affected at the time of the attacks and were in immediate mortal danger.\nWelcome back to Brussels all of you.\nLadies and gentlemen, in particular I should like to greet the following in our midst: Ignasi Guardans, who led the delegation, Daniel Caspary, B\u00e9la Glattfelder, Syed Kamall, Sajjad Karim, Erika Mann, Jan Tadeusz Masiel and Mia De Vits. It is wonderful that you are all ", "Inland transport of dangerous goods (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Bogus\u0142aw Liberadzki, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the inland transport of dangerous goods - C6-0012/2007 -.\nJacques Barrot\nVice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to submit to you today the proposal for amendment of the directive on the inland transport of dangerous goods.\nThe transport of dangerous goods accounts for about 8% of all goods transport, nearly a million operations every day. We have to guarantee freedom of movement for dangerous goods and intermodality in national and international services, whilst at the same time keeping an eye on the safety aspect in order to protect our environment, our citizens and workers in the sector.\nThis proposal is designed to update four directives and four Commission decisions on the transport of dangerous goods by merging them in a single legislative act. This is an important simplification of Community law on the subject.\nIn addition, the scope of the Community rules needs to be extended to include inland waterways transport, a sector that is not covered by any rules of Community law at present. Admittedly it is a less significant mode of inland transport, but an accident on an inland waterway can have serious consequences. A single set of rules for all transport of dangerous goods in internal waterways will make it possible to minimise those risks. Finally, the proposal relates to both international and national transport.\nThose are the aims of the proposal for which Mr Liberadzki is rapporteur. Before the debate begins, may I thank your rapporteur and TRAN for their support for the Commission proposal.\nBogus\u0142aw Liberadzki  \nrapporteur. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, it is my pleasure, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, to submit a report in which, first of all", "8.

Marketing standards for poultrymeat (\n- Before the vote:\nIlda Figueiredo\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, I just want to briefly explain that this report includes the amendments unanimously adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, further to the resolution adopted in this plenary on 19 June 2008, which rejected the Commission proposal aimed at authorising the marketing of poultrymeat for human consumption, even after being subject to anti-microbial treatment.\nI therefore want to thank all those who worked with me on this report, including the members and the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.\nWe hope that the European Commission and the Council will take account of this report and the opinion of the European Parliament in defence of public health, food safety and producers of poultrymeat in the European Union.\n", "Formal sitting - 20th anniversary of German reunification\nPresident\nDear colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, let me, on your behalf, welcome to the European Parliament all our honoured guests. Thank you for coming. Many of us remember - some of us who are very young will know it from history - the reunification of Germany 20 years ago.\nFour great world leaders were there: the President of the United States, George Bush senior, the leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher and the President of France, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, and, of course, the foreign ministers of the four countries, negotiating the reunification treaty.\nOne of the foreign ministers is today with us. I am very glad to welcome to the European Parliament Mr Roland Dumas. We are very glad to see you.\nWe also greet both German leaders at that time: the Chancellor of West Germany, Helmut Kohl and the Prime Minister of East Germany, Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re. Welcome to the European Parliament, 20 years later.\nThe European institutions played a very important role in German reunification. I should also like to say on behalf of all of us: welcome home, Enrique Bar\u00f3n Crespo, former President of the European Parliament. Enrique, it is your home! Thank you for coming.\nAnd last, but certainly not least, the President of the European Commission in those times, President Jacques Delors. We are very glad to see you. We are very grateful and we remember very well your speeches from those times. You were a great supporter of German unity and it was very important for all of us. There would be no reunification of Europe without the reunification of Germany. Those days were momentous for our continent and we can be proud of it and we will forever remember those days.\n(The House accorded the speaker a standing ovation)\nLothar de Maizi\u00e8re\nMr President, Mr Delors, ladies and gentlemen, as I look around, I can spot many well-known and familiar faces here and I am very ", "New developments in public procurement (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the short presentation of the report by Heide R\u00fchle, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on new developments in public procurement [2009/2175 (INI)] -.\nHeide R\u00fchle\nMr President, I would like to include in my thanks all the shadow rapporteurs for their constructive cooperation and for the good results achieved in committee so far. Allow me to reiterate and highlight the main points of my report.\nFirstly, we need greater legal certainty for all those involved - contracting authorities and contractors - with a view to better regulation. My report stresses the particularly great significance that public procurement has in times of crisis. However, my report also criticises the fact that the complex interaction of European legislation and national transposition has not resulted in a simplification and debureaucratisation of public procurement, as was, in fact, the aim of the 2004 revision, but rather in more work, high external costs for legal advice and protracted procedures. Unfortunately, this is at the expense of innovation and quality. Numerous studies show this to be the case. Far too often, the lack of legal clarity results in the cheapest offer being selected, rather than the best tender.\nWhilst the Commission now provides assistance in the area of green procurement, there is no such assistance in the areas of socially responsible procurement, fair trade or the promotion of innovation through procurement. The Commission has some urgent reworking to do here.\nBetter coordination within the Commission is also urgently needed. The European Court of Justice has removed a number of legal uncertainties in recent judgments and strengthened the role of public procurers, for example, by indicating that the scope of the directives should not be extended into areas such as urban planning. These judgments do not give contracting authorities a blank ch", "3. Nigeria\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on five motions for resolutions on Nigeria.\nMichael Gahler \nauthor. - (DE) Mr President, quite honestly I think a debate about the developing situation in Zimbabwe would be more urgent than all three topics we are debating this week. The detailed reports I am receiving are deeply distressing. That is not possible today, however, because we have limited ourselves to three topics in the urgent debate. I hope that we in the Working Group on Parliamentary Reform will abolish this self-imposed restriction for the urgent debate.\nSo far as the situation in Nigeria is concerned, we believe it is reasonable to look at the human rights deficits as a whole, especially in the light of the forthcoming elections, and not to confine ourselves to one topic. We also believe, and have said as much, that the present Bill in Nigeria contains violations of fundamental human rights. We are against any form of discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, and we also believe that a person's private life is an exclusively private matter, which must not be criminalised by the state.\nWe consider it a violation of the freedom of opinion if a person is sent to prison for advocating more liberal legislation. We believe, however, that a resolution on Nigeria must also take a stance on the other problems affecting people there as a whole, namely the widespread violence, the corruption, the immunity of those who violate human rights, the political intimidation in the run-up to the elections, possibly involving the security forces, the threat to the independence of the national electoral commission, the fact that the death penalty is still in force there, that there are still - especially in the parts of the country where sharia is practised - degrading physical punishments, and also that the problem of child labour is very much alive. Because we want to consider these points as a whole, we prefer to vote for our own resolution and not for the joi", "The charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures - Greening of transport and internalisation of external costs (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following reports:\nby Mr El Khadraoui, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 1999/62/EC on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures - C6-0276/2008 -, and\nby Mr Jarzembowski, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the greening of transport and the internalisation of external costs.\nSa\u00efd El Khadraoui\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to come straight to the point and clear up a few misunderstandings. I have read from various sources that, by bringing in this Eurovignette Directive, we are trying to give the road transport sector the kiss of death in these economically difficult times. I have also read that we mean to make road pricing compulsory for all passenger cars in Europe.\nThe truth is, of course, that we do not mean to impose anything at all; on the contrary, we wish to offer a wide range of possibilities to help Member States who so desire to introduce, in their own time, the 'polluter pays' principle into the road transport sector. That is, we want to establish a framework, to lay down ground rules that Member States must observe if they wish to internalise external costs.\nThis should bring us one step closer to a more sustainable transport system. I wish to add straight away that this is no miracle cure. Very many more measures will have to be taken if we are to work wonders. If we do nothing, however - as the Commission is well aware - road transport will increase by 55% by 2020. We therefore have to do something.\nWhat we are proposing here is a minor revolution in itself, if I may say so, but it is just a start, and will require an ambitious follow-up within a few years. With t", "Parliament's priorities for the UN Human Rights Council (Geneva, 1-26 March 2010) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on Parliament's priorities for the UN Human Rights Council (Geneva, 1-26 March 2010).\nDiego L\u00f3pez Garrido\nMr President, the European Union is preparing, in Geneva, in Brussels and in the capitals of third countries, for the first session of this year of the Human Rights Council.\nThe Human Rights Council is a forum for debating the human rights situation in all the regions of the world, and the efforts of the international community to improve the human rights situation, which is one of the principles, one of the elements, one of the essential characteristics of the spirit of the European Union, the thing that gives it its true identity in the world.\nThe Presidency of the Council has taken the role that it has to play at this time very seriously. It has taken the challenges that the European Union has to tackle during these sessions of the Human Rights Council very seriously. Proof of this is that the First Deputy Prime Minster of the Spanish Government, Mar\u00eda Teresa Fern\u00e1ndez de la Vega - in this case acting as the representative of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union - will be attending the 'High-level segment', which is going to begin the Council's 13th session.\nThe Presidency is therefore going to have an active presence in the work of the Council.\nWe will defend the European Union's positions on matters with special implications for numerous Member States and, in addition to the national initiatives, the European Union is going to table country resolutions.\nWe continue to believe that the Council needs to have instruments in order to defend human rights, in order to respond to situations of serious human rights violations, either through a specific country mandate - which is the case of Burma or the Democratic People's Republic of Korea - or through mandates on specific subjects within a coun", "Role of the European Union in the Middle East (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statements from the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and from the Commission on the role of the European Union in the Middle East. It is my pleasure to welcome into our midst the High Representative, Mr Solana, and to ask him to address us.\nJavier Solana\nHigh Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. - Mr President, this is the first time that I have appeared before you this year, 2009. It is a great pleasure to be here and I hope that the good cooperation we have had in the past will continue this year.\nThe war in Gaza ended a month ago, on 18 January, and I think you would agree with me that it feels like yesterday. The scale of the suffering and destruction was immense and it has left us all with a bitter taste in our mouths. The humanitarian situation today remains heart-breaking. We need to find urgent solutions to get aid in and to reduce the level of suffering of the people.\nAt the same time, we need to do all we can to end the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians and between Israel and the Arab world. In fact, the parameters of the solution are well known, and have been known for some time. What matters now is the political will to implement it among Israelis and Palestinians, among Arabs and the wider international community.\nThe European vocation for peace in the Middle East remains as strong as ever. Our commitment to the creation of a viable and independent Palestinian state, living side by side with Israel, is total. It is at the heart of our Middle East policy. All our actions have this strategic objective in mind. We will give our firm backing to all who want a peaceful solution to the many challenges across the Middle East region.\nThis House - Parliament - knows just how difficult and how intractable the situation may seem. Too often, the region has been plagued by cycles of violence, rising extremism and economi", "\nAlavanos\nMr President, I would like to make what I consider to be a very important point. Yesterday, I came to Strasbourg on Olympic Airways flight 165 from Athens to Frankfurt. When the plane arrived at Frankfurt airport, it was immediately surrounded by German police. Nobody spoke anything but German, and we were not allowed to leave the plane without showing our passports to the German police. I remind you that Greece, as well as Germany and France, are countries that belong to the Schengen area.\nThe worst thing is that this was not an exception; this, I was told, is something that happens systematically at Frankfurt airport when planes arrive from Greece. As a Member of the European Parliament, where we have so often voted on Schengen, I believe that, although there is legislation for the free movement of people, the fact that, in reality, this legislation is being systematically violated by the German authorities is an insult to, and undermines, our work. As this concerns the free movement of Members of the European Union, I would like the President of the European Parliament to take the appropriate measures to ensure that we come to Strasbourg in a way that befits people who belong to the European Union and to Schengen.\n\nPresident\nMr Alavanos, I consider that our President shall forward the text of your speech to the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Frankfurt airport authorities so that - and I do not know what the grounds might be for the current practice - we receive at least some sort of explanation or, alternatively, this procedure, which, I agree with you, has very little to do with the Schengen provisions, ceases to be used.\n\nHannan\nMr President, on Monday, in my absence and without any prior notification, Mr Murphy, the leader of the British Socialist Group, raised a question about my involvement in supporting the Danish anti-euro campaign. He was very careful not to accuse me of anything but has none the less contrived to give th", "Welcome\nPresident\nColleagues, I welcome the delegation from the EEA-EFTA Parliaments, that is our colleagues from Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, as well as the observers from the Swiss Federal Assembly, who are in the official gallery.\nIt is a pleasure for me to welcome this delegation to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, where they will participate in the 35th EEA JPC meeting today and tomorrow. I hope that the well-established work of the EEA JPC this week will be productive and will contribute to enhanced parliamentary cooperation, as well as to ensuring democratic parliamentary supervision within the EEA. Welcome, colleagues.\n", "Implementation of the Services Directive (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Gebhardt, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on implementation of the Services Directive [(2006/123/EC).\nEvelyne Gebhardt\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, here in the European Parliament, we have been debating the Services Directive for a long time, and we have expressed many concerns in our debates about how it should be implemented and how we can ensure that service providers have free movement within the European Union. This was an important piece of policy. That is why we, as Parliament, decided that we not only wanted to make the legislation, but that we also wanted to monitor how the Services Directive is actually transposed in the Member States. It is in our interest that the directive be transposed properly, correctly and well. The European Commission also agreed to help us in this regard. I would therefore like to thank Commissioner Barnier, who has provided us with valuable information in this connection.\nWe have particular concerns about four specific areas, namely, the evaluation procedure, the points of single contact, administrative cooperation and the scope of the directive.\nOn the first point, I have the following to say. Mutual evaluation is one of the core items where we, as Parliament, and I, as the then rapporteur, said actually, we are opposed to this, as this means an awful lot of bureaucracy in the Member States. I am also hearing from the Member States today that there are indeed complaints about the bureaucracy. In that regard, however, I would quite simply like to make it very clear to the Member States once again that they were the ones that wanted this, not Parliament! They inserted it into the legislation and, as such, they should take the responsibility for it themselves even if, for example, local communities are beginning to discuss what Europe has done to them again.\nOn the question of the second ", "7. Kosovo (vote) \nBefore the vote on Amendment 2:\nJohannes Lebech\nMr President, we found that it would not be fair to mention just one of the parties, so we would like to take out the reference to the Kosovo authorities. The amendment would then read: 'Underlines the importance of full regional economic cooperation and the obligation to comply with and fully implement the provisions of the CEFTA Agreement'.\n", "Resumption of the session\nPresident.\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 4 December 2002.\n\nPresident.\nThe final draft agenda as drawn up pursuant to Rules 110 and 110a of the Rules of Procedure by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 12 December has been distributed.\n\nMacCormick (Verts/ALE).\nMr President, I understand it is not possible to request a change, but may one protest against a change made by the Conference of Presidents? Today we should have been debating the Napolitano report on the role of regional and local authorities in European integration. It is a vitally important issue, and Parliament should have been ready to give its opinion on this to the Convention before the end of this year. For example, this week the Fisheries Council is debating cod stocks and the common fisheries policy. Scotland, which is hugely interested in that, at the moment has a walk-on role. The role of the regions in Europe matters deeply to people all over Europe and this Parliament has, by a stitch-up between the big parties, declined to debate it, although we have had it before us since July. It is outrageous that this has been taken off the agenda.\n\nPresident.\nThe proposal from the Conference of Presidents is that it will be discussed in Parliament in January.\nTuesday\nAs regards the Commission communication at 5 p.m. which will be made by Mrs Diamantopoulou on the future of pension systems, the Commission wishes to make a second communication by Mrs Schreyer on the modernisation of accounting.\nIt seems to me that since both of these issues are of some interest and substance we run the possibility of running over on the time originally allocated. Perhaps whoever is in the Chair should have the discretion to add some extra time to allow colleagues to ask questions on these two important communications.\n\nMacCormick (Verts/ALE).\nMr President, this is a very acceptable suggestion, but there is a risk that, yet again, t", "Estimates of revenue and expenditure for 2012 - Section I - Parliament (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Jos\u00e9 Manuel Fernandes, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the estimates of revenue and expenditure of Parliament for the financial year 2012 - Section I - Parliament.\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Fernandes\nMadam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to express my thanks to everyone who took part in drawing up this report, with particular thanks to the shadow rapporteurs from all political groups.\nThis is a report that will enable Parliament's 2012 budget to be an austerity budget, a containment budget, and a rigorous budget. In truth, we have effectively cut around EUR 49 million from the initial proposal. Regarding the position we have taken, which was voted on and supported by a broad majority here in the Chamber, we have gone further than we had committed ourselves to do. We had said that the update would be around the rate of inflation. We are a long way from the rate of inflation, which means that the 2012 budget will represent a reduction in real terms: a budget that will be below 20% under heading 5, which is where funds for the European institutions are posted. We have not achieved this objective and passed the 20% point for several years.\nI also recall that the Conference of Presidents has set the objective for Parliament's budget at 20-22%, with this year below that figure. However, as part of the implementation of the 2012 budget too, we will want savings using the principles of good management, economy, efficiency and effectiveness. We want all expenditure to be supported by documentary evidence, and we want all variable costs to be the subject of a cost-benefit analysis. In this way, we will also make additional savings during implementation.\nThe effort with regard to savings needs to be made by all institutions and provision made for the margin of heading 5, which includes the administrative costs of all institutions, ", "Agenda\nHowitt\nMr President, on a point of order under Rule 41 and Annex II of the Rules of Procedure. I received a letter yesterday saying that my Question No 41, concerning the plight of a Kosovan refugee, would not be taken at Question Time to the Council tonight as it is dealt with under Item 144 on the agenda. I think this is a genuine error. The question concerns the specific immigration status of a specific Kosovan refugee and the failure to provide visas for him from embassies in other EU states. Clearly this will not be dealt with in a general discussion about Kosovo. I would ask your services to look at this and ensure that this question at least receives a written answer so that this man does not have his job threatened and is not forced to go back to Kosovo where he would be in danger of losing his life.\n\nPresident\nMr Howitt, you know that paragraph 2 of Annex II (A) - Guidelines - says 'A question shall be inadmissible if the agenda already provides for the subject to be discussed with the participation of the institution concerned'. It is precisely not to have a general discussion disturbed by particular points by another channel. In any case, you can put that question next time or in any other form. I can admit it today when we have a general debate on Kosovo where any of the groups can take up your question. It is cannot be treated separately in Question Time. I am sorry, I cannot offer any other solution.\n\nOutcome of extraordinary European Council in Berlin of 24/25 March 1999\nPresident\nThe next item is the report of the European Council and the statement by the Commission on the results of the extraordinary European Council meeting of 24 and 25 March 1999 in Berlin.\nI should like to welcome Chancellor Schr\u00f6der, on what is his first visit to the House.\nI have received seven motions for resolutions to wind up this debate, tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2).\nApplause\n\nSchr\u00f6der\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, three weeks ago today, at about this time, th", "6.

The fact is, however, that at this point in the debate in Iraq, there is a proposal on the table to concentrate all the Christians into a single province. That is clearly unacceptable, because we would be forcing Christians from Kirkuk, Mosul and Baghdad to become ghettoised. In this respect, we hope to obtain a commitment from the European institutions, and subsequently we will transfer this clarification to the report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs on Iraq.\n", "Topical and urgent debate (objections)\nPresident\nThe next item is the vote on objections to the list of subjects for the next debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance (Rule 47 of the Rules of Procedure).\nItem I - Situation in Cyprus:\n\nCox\nMadam President, as we will have a statement on Bosnia tomorrow, we wish to withdraw the objection.\n\nPresident\nThere are therefore no further objections to Items I and II.\n\nPasty\nMadam President, we had tabled two resolutions. The first, about the matter of Bosnia, is withdrawn because it is dealt with elsewhere. But we are of course maintaining the second. Therefore we need only vote on the second resolution.\n\nPresident\nThe Union for Europe Group has requested the deletion of the item 'Expulsion of illegal immigrants' .\nJustification: all the Member States are facing serious human and economic problems because of the massive immigration from developing countries. We are not unmoved by the scale of this phenomenon. Yet we have to seek a solution together and in a considered manner. It seems totally inappropriate to us to discuss this in the framework of a topical and urgent debate.\n(Parliament rejected the request)\n\nPresident\nI have received two motions, from the Group of the Party of European Socialists and from the Union for Europe Group, seeking to insert a new item 'Support and conservation of the pilgrim route to Santiago de Compostela' .\n\nVarela Suanzes-Carpegna\nMadam President, a point of order to clarify a misunderstanding. I heard the destruction of pilgrim route to Santiago de Compostela mentioned. I come from that constituency - we have no Socialist Members in that constituency - and I must make it clear that the works do not affect the route to Santiago. The works are on a road which is not part of the route to Santiago. So Parliament does not need to take action on this issue.\n(Parliament approved the request)\n\nWelcome\nPresident\nBefore we begin the debate on the state of the Union with speeches from th", "\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 24 February 2005. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin this sitting by making a statement on certain issues which are topical and which have been raised by some Members of this Parliament.\nLadies and gentlemen, last Thursday, the Conference of Presidents of the Political Groups unanimously adopted a statement on the situation of journalists in Iraq for me to read to you today. This statement was the result of meetings I held with heads of the French and Italian media organisations of the European journalists held hostage in Iraq and representatives of the \u2018Reporters Without Borders\u2019 organisation.\nThe Conference of Presidents issued this statement, which was very widely reported in the European media.\nA little later, on Friday afternoon, we were overjoyed to hear of the release of Giuliana Sgrena. That joy was soon overshadowed by the death of Nicola Calipari, who died tragically while using his own body to protect Giuliana. Let us acknowledge today the courage and sense of duty that lost Nicola Calipari his life in carrying out that duty.\nIn tribute to him, I would like today to join with the Italian authorities, in particular Presidents Ciampi and Berlusconi, who have called on the United States authorities to clarify fully the dramatic circumstances in which Nicola Calipari died. As in other similar circumstances, we must know how and why these tragic events have taken place.\nThis morning the whole of Italy paid a posthumous tribute. I would like our Parliament to join the Italian people in their acknowledgement and, on behalf of all of you, to communicate our solidarity and friendship to his family at this painful time.\nToday, Giuliana is back amongst us and enjoying freedom, but we must continue our efforts to achieve the release of Florence Aubenas and her interpreter and guide, Hussein Hanun Al-Saadi. They are still being held captive, held by people who ", "3. Chad\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution on Chad.\nErik Meijer\nauthor. - (NL) Mr President, colonial rule in the former territories of French West Africa and French Central Africa came to an end between 1958 and 1960. This was not the outcome of a protracted conflict and the resulting emergence of a collective national consciousness, but rather a way of preventing the development of liberation movements. It was a top-down rather than a bottom-up process. From French overseas departments they first became autonomous territories and then independent states.\nWith the exception of Guinea (Conakry), French influence has nevertheless always remained greater in these states than in other former colonies. The big desert state of Chad still has a French military presence and that has certainly influenced who was allowed to rule the country and who was not. This powerful European influence has not led to the development of European standards of democracy and human rights in these countries. The states and their national borders derive not from domestic movements which shaped an independent state, but simply from the colonial past.\nThis means that ethnic differences can lead to ethnic confrontations. In countries like these that means a continuing struggle for power, over who are the first-class citizens and who the second-class citizens. Ethnic and geographical diversity is often not reflected, or only poorly reflected, in the composition of the government. The problems this causes cannot, in my Group's view, simply be resolved by stationing a new body of European troops there. There has always been a military presence there, and it has made the present situation worse rather than better. The answer lies not in stabilising the current situation, which only benefits the current rulers, but in making space for change from the bottom up.\nFilip Kaczmarek\nauthor. - (PL) Mr President, in the draft resolution we refer to the Cotonou Agreement and,", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nEisma\nMr President, I have nothing to say about the Minutes, I am perfectly happy with them. Yesterday, however, an amendment by the Liberals on the Viola report was rejected for some incomprehensible reason. It was all about making the institutions more environmentally friendly. I would therefore like to put the following request to you. If you wish to promote the use of bicycles here in Strasbourg, you need to ensure that there are adequate covered bicycle racks, but if you look in the garage, the racks are by no means sufficient for the Members and their assistants. Could I ask you to increase the number of bicycle racks in the garage at the expense of perhaps two car-parking spaces?\n\nPresident\nThank you, Mr Eisma. I have taken note of your request and I will pass it on to the Bureau and, in particular, to the College of Quaestors so that they may examine this matter in the most positive light possible.\n\nKerr\nMr President, regarding the Minutes on my speech yesterday, I want to raise a point. I mentioned at the end of my speech on Pinochet that I feared that the British Government was about to do a deal to let him go. In this morning's Guardian it is reported that precisely that is going to happen. I just want to confirm that my prediction was correct.\n\nPresident\nMr Kerr, you are aware of the leniency of this Chair, particularly on Friday mornings, which are peaceful days. But this has nothing to do with the Minutes.\nI see that there are no comments on the Minutes.\n(The Minutes were approved)\n\nHallam\nMr President, on a point of order. I have, on a number of occasions on a Friday, raised the fact that this sitting, which is often a very good sitting, is not televised. It is not available for television companies to use and it is not available for archives. I should again like to press the point and ask when this sitting is going to be properly telev", "Approval of Minutes of previous sitting: see Minutes\n\nPhilip Claeys\n(NL) Mr President, just a marginal note to this week's part-session. As you know, the first round of voting for the 2007 Sakharov Prize will be taking place shortly. There were five nominees. The ITS Group had nominated a candidate too, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. We now find that the Patriarch has been put under pressure not to stand. To my knowledge nothing like this has ever happened in the whole of the time that European Parliament has awarded the Sakharov Prize. He was happy for his name to be put forward by our Group - Mr Binev asked him and he was perfectly agreeable. This is something quite intolerable. As far as I know it has never happened before that someone has been pressured to withdraw his candidacy purely and simply because he was nominated by a group that rows against the mainstream. Well, in protest at this kind of outrage, this kind of underhand political machination, I can tell you now that the ITS Group will not be voting in the upcoming election.\nPresident\nMr Claeys, I have heard of the events you are talking about, but cannot give a view on the substance of what you say has occurred. This is not really the right moment to inform Parliament; it should be done in a different form so that we can discuss this question.\n", "\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, please take your seats for what is practically a historic sitting, the last Friday sitting in Strasbourg.\nIndeed, it is my very great pleasure to chair this, the last sitting in the millennium, as the next time we meet within these walls it will be both a new century and a new millennium.\n\nPosselt\nMr President, I should just like to make a slight correction to what you said: this is not our last Friday sitting in Strasbourg but our last Friday sitting in Strasbourg for the time being. We decide our calendar of sittings each year, and I hope that this costly and erroneous decision will be reversed and that we will once again use the full five days in Strasbourg and do away with the expensive mini-sessions instead.\n\nPresident\nI sense that we are going to have a whole new debate on the issue.\n\nBerthu\nMr President, I can confirm what Mr Posselt has just said. This is not the last Friday sitting in Strasbourg. I deeply regret that the French Government has not appealed to the Court of Justice against the European Parliament decision, but I have no doubt that this decision will be overturned sooner or later. I imagine it refrained from taking action purely because such action was not timely under the French Presidency.\nThe 1997 ruling, which re-established the annual timetable after an attempt by the European Parliament to withdraw one of the monthly sittings, was perfectly clear. The European Parliament has no sovereign right to determine its timetable. It must respect the Treaty, and the Protocol appended to the Treaty states quite clearly that the twelve monthly part-sessions are to be held in Strasbourg. The Advocate-General at the time clearly stipulated \"the 12 periods of monthly plenary sessions\". This phrase means that we must adhere to existing practice, which must not be changed.\n\nPresident\nTo put it in terms that we can all agree on, let us say that this is the last Strasbourg part-session of the second millennium, and we shall ", "9. Amendment of the Rules of Procedure in light of the Statute for Members (vote) \n- Report: Friedrich\n- Before the vote:\nIngo Friedrich  \nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, very briefly, this concerns the amendment of the Rules of Procedure in light of the new Statute from 2009. It strengthens the individual Member's right of initiative, creates more transparency, provides a clear definition of which files can be inspected, and offers what I believe to be an intelligent solution to the question of languages, so that the smaller languages will not be discriminated against. As we have not debated this issue, I think it is important that you should be informed about it. Thank you for your attention.\n", "2. The escalation of violence in Mexico\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on seven motions for resolutions on the escalation of violence in Mexico.\nRam\u00f3n J\u00e1uregui Atondo\nauthor. - (ES) Mr President, I would like to begin by saying that Mexico is a great democracy that has progressed steadily over the last 20 years. It is a friend of the European Union and we share a Strategic Partnership Agreement. I would also like to say that Mexico is currently waging a very difficult war against organised drug trafficking.\nToday in the European Parliament, however, we are talking about Mexico in the context of human rights, because there has been and continues to be a marked increase in violence, which affects Mexican people in particular, and because there have been repeated, serious complaints about human rights violations.\nThe resolution that the major political groups are going to adopt here today is based on respect and consensus; of course, it recognises the situation I have just described and urges Mexico to continue on the path towards rule of law and full democracy.\nHowever, it also makes four important requests: it urges Mexico to ensure the right to a free press, because there have been attacks on journalists; to guarantee protection for the organisations that defend human rights, because those groups have been attacked and threatened; to guarantee protection for women who suffer violence, because many women have been murdered; and to avoid impunity and abuses of power by their police forces. This is what Parliament has asked of Mexico, in the spirit of friendship based on a favourable relationship with Mexico.\nRenate Weber\nauthor. - (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this week we are celebrating International Women's Day. In this Parliament, we have seen a great many posters in all the languages of the European Union, saying that we can put a stop to violence against women. Today we are talking about violence in Mexico, and I think it is right that we shoul", "Voting time\nPresident\nWe shall now proceed to the vote.\n(For the outcome and other details of the vote: see Minutes)\nStruan Stevenson\nMr President, before we take the vote on the calendar, could I raise the point about tomorrow's intended strike. I understand that Air France will be on strike, the trains will be on strike and the airport workers will be on strike. This makes our life as parliamentarians impossible. I have spent the morning trying to reschedule flights in order that I can return to my constituency. It means that I will miss the voting session tomorrow. It is interfering with our work as parliamentarians. We are about to vote on the calendar, which requires us to come here twelve times a year, and yet France does nothing to make our life easy in coming here. It is almost impossible. If we are going to continue to come to Strasbourg, perhaps we could make some changes to the transport systems to enable us to come here?\n(Applause)\nPresident\nMr Stevenson, we note what you have said but we should not start a debate at this juncture before we adopt the calendar of part-sessions on this general basis.\nDaniel Cohn-Bendit\n(FR) Mr President, I simply wish to tell the Member that the right to strike exists in the European Union, the right to strike is the right to strike, and I also find it incredible for a country to be asked to provide a strike calendar. This is ridiculous, completely ridiculous. I also wish to tell our colleague that Belgian workers have been on strike on many occasions, and so where would this Parliament go if the Belgians went on strike? It is a ridiculous discussion. If he wishes to go back, he can go back; if he wishes to stay, all he has to do is stay another day and have some asparagus.\n(Applause from the left)\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, these two contributions have made it clear how pluralistic the European Union is in nature, and I think that in principle we should be grateful for that. However, I would like to add - and I say t", "Evaluation of the Dublin system (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Lambert, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the evaluation of the Dublin system.\nJean Lambert\nrapporteur. - Mr President, I should also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their serious interest and commitment, and all those who have contributed to this report.\nThe Dublin II Regulation, as you will know, is part of the European common asylum system and it determines which Member State is responsible for the examination and determination of an asylum claim. Its effect is also linked very much to the sound implementation of other directives, such as the Reception and the Procedures Directives.\nOur committee report makes clear that the Dublin Regulation, and indeed the system as a whole, is a system based on mutual trust and reliability, so that all Member States have to fulfil their responsibilities.\nWe have a number of concerns which we address in this report - although I obviously will not address them all here - about the quality of delivery in terms of the asylum system, the impact on the individuals concerned and whether Dublin II is effective overall. What problems does it create for some Member States? Are we almost looking at something and making it too simple for the complexity of the issue?\nOn the quality of delivery, we know that there are enormous variations between Member States in delivering a fair and thorough examination of claims for protection. This is unjust for the individual and unfair to other Member States. In fact, looking at one or two Member States within the European Union, if you were an asylum-seeker really fearing for your life you would have to be almost suicidal to claim asylum in one or two of them, because your chances of having your claim recognised would be so low and, therefore, your risk of return would be very high.\nSo we agree as a committee that we wish to see systematic measures taken against tho", "3. Burma\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on seven motions for resolutions on Burma.\nAnneli J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki\nauthor. - Madam President, with this resolution, the European Parliament calls on the Burmese Government to put an end to human rights violations and to start genuine dialogue with the opposition and ethnic representatives of Burma, as well as with the international community, and to take concrete steps towards a peaceful transition to a democratic system of government.\nBurma is going to hold an election this year for the first time in 30 years. Unfortunately, the election laws published do not provide for fair and free elections. The opposition is not involved in the process and many of the opposition leaders are still under house arrest. Many political activists are in prison, and the opposition party has decided to boycott the elections completely.\nThe last thing I want to say is that the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Burma has condemned the gross and systematic human rights abuses. I hope Parliament will do the same.\nFilip Kaczmarek\nThe situation in Burma forces us to turn our attention to this country repeatedly.\nToday, we condemn the intention to conduct elections under completely undemocratic conditions and on principles which have excluded the main opposition party and deprived hundreds of thousands of Burmese of the right to vote and to be candidates. This is an obvious attempt to keep the opposition out of the elections. In such conditions, even the very expression 'elections' does not correspond to reality.\nWe also condemn the fact that under the new constitution, the army will be guaranteed at least 25% of the seats in parliament and will have the authority to suspend civil liberties and the legislature at any time it deems this necessary in the interests of national security.\nWe condemn the continued and systematic violation of human rights, fundamental freedoms and democratic rights of the people of Burma, but we also appeal to the gover", "Transportation of horses for slaughter in the European Union (written declaration) \nPresident\nI would like to inform you that Written Declaration 0054/2009 by Mrs Lynne, Mrs J\u0119drzejewska and Mr Schlyter on the transportation of horses for slaughter in the European Union was signed today, 24 February 2010, by a majority of Parliament's component Members. Therefore, in accordance with Rule 124(4) of the Rules of Procedure, it will be forwarded to its addressees and published with the names of its signatories in the Texts Adopted of the sitting of 25 February 2010.\nWe would like to thank the authors for submitting this declaration.\nElizabeth Lynne\nauthor. - Mr President, it is great news that we have achieved the right number of signatures. Thank you everyone for signing this written declaration.\nPresident\nI would like to inform you that I did not have the possibility of signing this declaration, and I am ready to do it immediately.\n", "Airbus/Boeing WTO disputes (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the Airbus/Boeing WTO disputes by Helmuth Markov, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade - B6-0155/2008).\nHelmuth Markov\nauthor. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the trade dispute between the European Union and the United States about large aircraft is no ordinary controversy like others that are taken to the WTO for resolution. This dispute has led to by far the largest and most complicated proceedings that have ever been instituted. It involves an enormous conflict of interest.\nThe United States has criticised the way in which the EU and the Member States involved in the EADS consortium have subsidised the introduction of new large aircraft over the last 20 years. For its part, the EU has accused the United States of granting hidden subsidies to Boeing as part of defence and aerospace projects in which it is involved. We do not yet know which way the WTO Dispute Settlement Body will decide. I assume that the decision will be that both parties have violated applicable WTO rules. Whatever the outcome of the case, it is still possible to make some recommendations.\nFirstly, perhaps it is time both Boeing and Airbus relied much more on their own resources instead of being able to fall back on comprehensive state subsidies, then keeping the support and profit for themselves but avoiding risk by means of the company structure. Better functioning and greater transparency in the aviation sector would certainly benefit all aspects of the industry and also customers.\nThis does not mean that large aircraft manufacturers should no longer receive any financial support at all. I should simply like to emphasise that a balanced, appropriate system is needed that does not favour the interests of large companies but also takes into account important issues such as, for example, the creation of jobs and the protection of the enviro", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nHubert Pirker\n(DE) Mr President, I did not understand you at first. I voted for this report because this new regulation creates a good balance between sensible anti-terrorism measures on the one hand and passenger rights on the other hand.\nI should, however, like to focus on a point that has still not been satisfactorily resolved, and that is the rules on the carrying of liquids. We know that the controls should be used for the prevention of terrorism, but these controls are causing a lot of anger among passengers owing to the individual airports' widely differing interpretations. Whether or not this is an effective instrument is still unresolved. I doubt it very much, because terrorists have long been developing other strategies and finding other ways.\nI expect that the following assessment will be made: either the control procedures are standardised and improved, or else these measures are stopped, with the aim of not burdening passengers with measures that are in any case not at all effective.\nBernard Wojciechowski\n(PL) Mr President, I voted in favour of the Costa report. Almost six years have elapsed since Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 was passed. Two and a half years have elapsed since it entered into force. Concern for passenger security at airports and on board aircraft continues to be very much a live issue. Protection of civil aviation is causing a dramatic rise in the cost of flying and a decrease in travel comfort. The cost of protection is another matter; these costs must be as transparent as possible, and consumers need to know what the money they pay for an air ticket is being spent on and how. Payments collected for the purposes of protection should be utilised solely and exclusively to cover protection costs. Money obtained for this purpose must not be used for any other purpose.\nJan B\u0159ezina\n(CS) Mr President, I abstained from voting on the proposal for a regulation on common rules because I think it cont", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 24 May 1996.\n\nMartens\nMr President, I should like to refer to the Rules of Procedure, more particularly Rule 5. After our part-session in Strasbourg the Belga press agency published a telex message under the heading 'Members of the European Parliament do not want to economize on their own allowances' , in which it was stated amongst other things that at the moment Members of the European Parliament receive a lump sum allowance for their travelling expenses. A Greek or a Finnish Member, for example, automatically receives a huge travel bonus, business class, the minute he or she attends meetings in Brussels or Strasbourg. No check is made as to whether Members actually travel to and from their country or whether they pocket money by travelling cheaply. Our fellow-Members Mrs Aelvoet and Mr Lannoye have also made statements to the same effect, which have received extensive coverage in the Belgian press.\nRule 5 of the Rules of Procedure provides that the Bureau is to lay down rules governing the payment of expenses and allowances to Members. Rule 4 of the Bureau's rules provides amongst other things, first that Members are entitled to the lump sum travel allowance mentioned in Article 1(1) for only one return journey each week. Secondly, if a Member makes more than one return journey in a working week he receives for the extra journeys an allowance for the travelling expenses actually incurred. They are reimbursed on the basis of an air ticket or a first-class rail ticket upon presentation of the relevant ticket to the Members' allowances branch. Car journeys are reimbursed on the basis of the first class rail fare.\nI ask you, Mr President, whether or not the provisions of Rule 4 of these rules on Members' expenses and allowances are being applied.\n\nPresident\nI am of course informed of remarks and public statements by our colleagues on the practice of Membe", "8. Annual report on the European Ombudsman's activities in 2007 (\nBefore the vote on amendment 5\nDushana Zdravkova\nrapporteur. - Mr President, as has been discussed, my oral amendment is as follows (paragraph 23): 'Proposes that the Ombudsman take measures to reduce the number of complaints in such cases where no action is possible;'. The end of the paragraph has been changed.\n(The oral amendment was accepted)\nBefore the vote on amendment 7\nDushana Zdravkova\nrapporteur. - Mr President, it is just to delete the words 'by the first European Ombudsman' from the first part of the amendment.\nPresident\n(The oral amendment was accepted)\nThat concludes voting time.\n", "World Bank energy strategy (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Eva Joly, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the World Bank's energy strategy for developing countries - B70012/2011).\nFranziska Keller\nauthor. - Mr President, today, 1.5 billion people are currently without access to electricity, but access to energy is a prerequisite for the eradication of the poverty that these people live in. The right to energy implies that energy supplies achieve universal and reliable access: equitable access that bridges the gap between urban and rural areas and is also affordable. It is also crucial for a country to develop a sustainable and secure energy supply, and the most reliable and secure one is a decentralised use of renewables.\nBut energy does not only need to be secure and reliable; its production also needs to take into account other issues such as climate change, deforestation, environmental degradation, human health, and the poverty it causes. These problems cannot be tackled by fossil fuels. Fossil fuels have a disastrous impact on health, environment and climate. At the same time, the climate crisis is doing more damage to those living in extreme poverty. Fossil fuels create pollution that endangers both human health and a healthy environment, and they are expensive and their prices increase the more we run out of oil and gas. Fossil fuels create centralised, hierarchic and inflexible energy distribution.\nWe have to focus on renewables. We have to assist developing countries to leapfrog our destructive fossil fuel path. Only renewables can bring a solution to these problems. Renewable energy uses resources that will never run out and that many developing countries have in abundance: sun and wind mainly. They can be employed locally on a very small and inexpensive scale, which is also, in a very literal sense, empowering people. Decentralised power supplies are in the hands of the people. They are dem", "Situation of people with disabilities\nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Lynne, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the situation of people with disabilities in the enlarged European Union: the European Action Plan 2006-2007.\nElizabeth Lynne \nrapporteur. - Mr President, I am pleased to have been given the opportunity to be Parliament's rapporteur on the disability action plan. I worked closely with disabled people's organisations, the Commission and fellow MEPs, and I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs very much for their cooperation. I should also like to thank the Secretariat and I extend my special thanks to the European Disability Forum. I also sought advice from another 100 disability organisations across the European Union. I sincerely hope the report reflects the fact that it was produced not just by me but by the whole committee.\nI welcomed the Commission communication, but I felt there were some areas that could be strengthened. With regard to employment in particular, it is essential first and foremost to implement existing legislation, particularly the 2000 Employment Directive. I know the Commission is monitoring that closely.\nHowever, certain grey areas need to be clarified, such as reasonable accommodation or reasonable adjustment. It is also vital that trade unions inform people of their rights under anti-discrimination legislation. However, whatever we do in terms of employment, it is of little use to disabled people unless they have access to the built environment or to transport facilities. That is why one of my demands is further legislation on bus and coach travel, similar to that for air travel. I know the Commission is looking at that as well.\nEducation and training are also the key to integration. I have always said that Member States should work towards including children in mainstream education wherever possible, but, at the same time, recognising that some children may not thrive in that atmosp", "\nMcNally\nMadam President, on a point of order. I wish to inform the House of the news of the closure of a car factory in Luton in the United Kingdom, with the loss of many thousands of jobs. I am sure the House will be concerned to hear of this latest example of decline in industry in Europe.\n\nPresident\nI have duly noted the fact.\n\nCompetition between postal services\nPresident\nThe next item is the report (A5-0361/2000) by Mr Ferber, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 97/67/EC on opening to competition of Community postal services [COM(2000)0319 - C5-0375/2000 - 2000/0139(COD)].\n\nAtkins\nMadam President, on a point of order. If we are to debate this important question today, it is essential to have the amendments that were tabled in the various languages for us to know what we are debating. They are not available. I tried last night and first thing this morning. It seems to me an impossible state of affairs when we are debating a very important subject and amendments have come in late, together with those that went to committee, and we do not have them in our mother tongue.\n\nPresident\nMr Atkins, the services tell me that the delay was only for this week. They thought the translations could be made available in spite of this fairly difficult and densely packed timetable. Nonetheless, I have no doubt that this Chamber will have been able to examine each of the amendments in detail and I think it is possible to have the debate on this report. In any case, all the translations will be available to MEPs between now and the time of the vote.\n\nSavary\nMadam President, I want to talk about the same point of order as Mr Atkins. I do not think it is usual for the discussion preceding a vote to be a discussion of amendments. We discussed the latter in committee. What is more, I was able to obtain these amendments yesterday and I believe that we are called upon to ", "Research guidelines 2002 - 2006\nPresident\n The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0052/2001) by Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Commission communication to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Making a reality of the 'European Research Area' : Guidelines for European Union research activities (2002-2006) [COM(2000) 612 - C5-0738/2000 - 2000(COS)].\n\nPlooij-van Gorsel\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, never before have I spoken for so long in Parliament. You may go for a nap in between because eight minutes really is rather long.\nCommissioner, it is now almost a year since it was agreed during the European Council in Lisbon that the European Union wants to become the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world and this Parliament rallied around that goal with a large majority. If the European Union wants to achieve this goal, then more investment in research, technological development, innovation and education is essential, both in the Member States as well as at European level. The creation of a European Research Area is vital to this. European research has proved a success: and the innovative efforts of Europe's businesses are also impressive, accounting in the first half of the 1990s for 33% of turnover. The European Framework Programmes of research and technological development have definitely contributed to this as well. The success of the Framework Programmes must therefore be retained in the future and that will also have to be demonstrated when the proposals for the sixth Framework Programme are discussed. But at the moment, ladies and gentlemen, there is absolutely no question of having one European research policy. The proposals made by Commissioner Busquin in order to actually bring such a policy about were well received by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Ener", "Implementation of the EU strategy for the Danube region (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on\nthe oral question to the Commission on implementation of the EU strategy for the Danube region by Silvia-Adriana \u0162ic\u0103u, Constanze Angela Krehl, Hannes Swoboda, Adrian Severin, Ivailo Kalfin, Karin Kadenbach, Olga Sehnalov\u00e1, Rovana Plumb, Csaba S\u00e1ndor Tabajdi, Evgeni Kirilov, Katar\u00edna Neve\u010falov\u00e1, Vasilica Viorica D\u0103ncil\u0103, Daciana Octavia S\u00e2rbu, Ioan Mircea Pa\u015fcu, George Sabin Cuta\u015f, Britta Thomsen, Corina Cre\u0163u, Claudiu Ciprian T\u0103n\u0103sescu, Ioan Enciu, C\u0103t\u0103lin Sorin Ivan, Mario Pirillo, Kinga G\u00f6ncz, Marc Tarabella, Fran\u00e7oise Castex, Victor Bo\u015ftinaru, In\u00e9s Ayala Sender, Bogus\u0142aw Liberadzki, Jo Leinen, Michael Cashman, Brian Simpson, Sa\u00efd El Khadraoui, Thijs Berman, Eider Gardiaz\u00e1bal Rubial, Ismail Ertug, Edit Herczog, on behalf of the S&D Group; Michael Theurer, Vladko Todorov Panayotov, Renate Weber, Sophia in 't Veld, Jan Mulder, Gesine Meissner, Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, Catherine Bearder, Viktor Uspaskich, Wolf Klinz, Nadja Hirsch, Cristian Silviu Bu\u015foi, Giommaria Uggias, Ramona Nicole M\u0103nescu, Adina-Ioana V\u0103lean, Hannu Takkula, J\u00fcrgen Creutzmann, Alexander Alvaro, Holger Krahmer, on behalf of the ALDE Group; Reinhard B\u00fctikofer, Michael Cramer, Eva Lichtenberger, Barbara Lochbihler, Heide R\u00fchle, Elisabeth Schroedter, Isabelle Durant, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group; Peter van Dalen, Old\u0159ich Vlas\u00e1k, on behalf of the ECR Group - B7-0013/2011);\nthe oral question to the Commission on EU strategy for the Danube region by Tam\u00e1s Deutsch, Lambert van Nistelrooij, Danuta Maria H\u00fcbner, Marian-Jean Marinescu, Iosif Matula, Andrey Kovatchev, J\u00e1nos \u00c1der, Zolt\u00e1n Bag\u00f3, Kinga G\u00e1l, B\u00e9la Glattfelder, Andr\u00e1s Gy\u00fcrk, \u00c1gnes Hankiss, L\u00edvia J\u00e1r\u00f3ka, \u00c1d\u00e1m K\u00f3sa, Csaba \u0150ry, Ildik\u00f3 G\u00e1ll-Pelcz, Gy\u00f6rgy Sch\u00f6pflin, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Surj\u00e1n, J\u00f3zsef Sz\u00e1jer, Edit Bauer, Alajos M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, Csaba S\u00f3gor, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u0151k\u00e9s, Iuliu Winkler, Elisabeth Jeggle, on behalf of the PPE Group - B7-0011/2011).\nSilvia-Adriana \u0162ic\u0103u\n", "18. 2006 discharge: European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (\n- Before the vote:\nHerbert B\u00f6sch  \nChairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control. - (DE) Mr President, I would like to point out to the chamber that the resolutions on discharge of the agencies will be adopted without explanatory statements.

You can read it for yourself in the relevant resolutions: At first, it was proposed to censor only a small part. I objected, based precisely on the Rules of Procedure, whereupon Mr B\u00f6sch - I believe completely arbitrarily and wrongfully - deleted the entire explanatory statement, which related to points of criticism which, by the way, have been expressed in exactly the same words by his group in public.

Nutrition and health claims made on foods (vote) \n- Report: Adriana Poli Bortone\n- Before the vote:\nMargot Wallstr\u00f6m\nVice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, the Commission makes the following declaration. The Commission, sharing the views expressed by Parliament, acknowledges the urgent need to have a scientific evaluation of children's health claims already on the market. Therefore, it will give priority to the necessary procedure to allow for a rapid decision on claims referring to children's development and health and will also ask the European Food Safety Authority to give priority to processing the evaluation of such claims. Furthermore, the Commission confirms that, pending the establishment of nutrient profiles, the process of evaluating such claims can start without delay.\n", "Repeal of directives regarding metrology (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Anja Weisgerber, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council repealing Council Directives 71/317/EEC, 71/347/EEC, 71/349/EEC, 74/148/EEC, 75/33/EEC, 76/765/EEC, 76/766/EEC and 86/217/EEC regarding metrology - C6-0467/2008 -.\nAnja Weisgerber\nMr President, Commissioner Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by offering my sincere thanks to the shadow rapporteurs from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, those who helped produce this report and everyone who contributed to this splendid result. Without the constructive and very open collaboration with both the Commission and with the Belgian Presidency of the Council, it would not be possible to conclude this package tomorrow.\nAs I am sure you can imagine, I am very satisfied with this result. The repeal of a total of eight outdated and obsolete directives will enable us to take another step in the direction of less bureaucracy in Europe. What is interesting in said directives is that they largely became obsolete because they have already been replaced by international standards that represent the latest state of the art. Member State rules and regulations are often rendered obsolete by harmonised European rules and regulations, after all. In this case, European rules and regulations have become superfluous thanks to international stipulations.\nIf we want to make progress towards our target of having 25% less bureaucracy in Europe by 2012, we need to nail our colours to the mast now. To put it in the words of the Chair of the High Level Group of Independent Stakeholders on Administrative Burdens, Edmund Stoiber, we in Europe must not only purse our lips, we need to whistle loudly. In other words, our words must be followed up by tangible action. When it comes to that action, the devil ", "\nVan Orden\nI want to draw attention to the deteriorating situation in Zimbabwe. We have seen President Mugabe's wanton non-compliance with the undertakings given at the Abuja summit on September and only last weekend the snub he delivered to the visiting EU Troika. It seems time now to introduce smart sanctions against Mugabe and his henchmen. This is what we called for in Parliament's resolution and I would ask you to use your best offices now to bring that about.\n\nPresident\nAs you know, Mr Van Orden, the comment made at the end of the troika' s visit was precisely that, if the undertakings were not complied with, the European Union would have no option but to take steps, including sanctions. I believe we shall be obliged to be consistent if things do not go well, as seems likely.\n\nHuman genetics\nPresident\nThe next item is the report (A5-0391/2001) by Mr Fiori, on behalf of the Temporary Committee on Human Genetics and Other New Technologies in Modern Medicine, on the ethical, legal, economic and social implications of human genetics [2001/2097(INI)].\n\nFiori\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in June last year, President Bill Clinton in the United States and Prime Minister Tony Blair in the United Kingdom presented to the world the map of the human genome, which had been arrived at simultaneously by their respective research groups. A month later, Nature brought the discoveries to the attention of the world scientific community in more detail. In the last few days, we have had news of the first experiment on the road towards human cloning in the United States.\nAs often happens with day-after prophecies, voices are now being raised in alarm, unanimously expressing the most indignant condemnation and concern. The researchers themselves recognise that they have shown the way to those who might want to commit the folly of cloning a human being.\nThese are two historic moments: little more than a year has passed between one and the other but it almost seem", "New PNR agreement  SWIFT (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on\nthe oral question by Pervenche Ber\u00e8s, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and Jean-Marie Cavada, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, to the Council, on the new PNR agreement and SWIFT B6-0001/2007), and\nthe oral question by Pervenche Ber\u00e8s, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and Jean-Marie Cavada, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, to the Council, on the new PNR agreement and SWIFT B6-0002/2007).\nG\u00fcnter Gloser\nMr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, we now turn from such fundamentally demanding issues as energy and climate change to discuss another very important matter that has, in the past, demanded your attention here in the European Parliament, and also that of the European Union as a whole not merely on one occasion but repeatedly, and the issue to which I refer is that of the sharing of airline passengers' personal data.\nAs we all know, following the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, the United States enacted legislation according to which airlines running flights into and out of the United States must permit the US authorities electronic access to the data in their automatic reservation and processing systems, the material known as 'passenger name records', and, should the airlines decline to comply, they are threatened with the withdrawal of their landing rights.\nI would now like to briefly remind the House of the state of play. In May 2006, the European Court of Justice had, in response to an appeal by your House, declared null and void the Council decision on the agreement between the European Community and the USA relating to the forwarding of passenger data to the US authorities and, likewise, the Commission's decision on the appropriateness of the data protection measures.\nThe ECJ's fundamental justification for its decision was the European", "18.

So I recommend voting for the legislative resolution.\n", "Integrated Maritime Policy (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Meissner, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on integrated maritime policy (IMP) - evaluation of progress made and new challenges -.\nGesine Meissner\nMr President, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn, ladies and gentlemen, I wish that the Chamber were full to bursting, not on my account or because this is my first report, but because of the subject matter, which is unfamiliar to many people, but nevertheless highly important.\nHardly anyone has heard of integrated maritime policy, but it is a decisive subject for us all, because it really is true that our future lies in the sea. A total of 70% of the earth's surface consists of water. Population levels are growing, not in Europe, but throughout the rest of the world and by 2050 they will have reached 9 billion. The earth is becoming too small and many experts have already discovered the significant potential of the oceans. Our objective must now be to keep the resources of the seas safe for future generations by means of the integrated maritime policy.\nSo far only 10% of the oceans and their resources have been explored, but we already have 50 000 products which come from the sea. Efforts are now being made to produce energy from the sea and to extract raw materials for medicines, cosmetics and industry. While we are developing our overall maritime policy, it is important to ensure that the sea does not strike back, as it did in a sensational novel by bestselling author Frank Sch\u00e4tzing. We have the opportunity to turn the maritime economy into the largest area of growth in our economy as a whole. For this reason, people are talking today not only about green jobs, but also about blue jobs and blue growth. The coastline of the EU is 23 000 kilometres in length and one third of the population lives by the sea. Green shipping and offshore energy are areas where Europe has extensive expertise which can be developed further. For this reason", "ECB annual report for 2009 - Latest developments on international currency exchange rates (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following:\nthe report by Mr Balz, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the ECB annual report 2009, and\nthe Commission statement on the latest developments on international currency exchange rates.\nBurkhard Balz\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just had a request for everyone to quieten down a bit. Perhaps certain Members could comply with that request.\nLadies and gentlemen, my report today essentially concerns the performance of the European Central Bank in 2009 - in other words, during a period in which economic, financial and, increasingly, also political actions, were substantially dominated by the economic and financial crisis. The crisis, which started off as a purely financial crisis, spread, and also affected the entire real economy in a second wave. Economic activity diminished worldwide, while falling tax revenues and increasing welfare expenditure as a result of the crisis led to increasing public deficits. Further measures to stimulate the economy also contributed to the level of debt. As a result of these increased deficits, governments throughout the European Union passed extensive austerity packages. In my opinion, these packages were necessary and, in some cases, even overdue. However, they constrained the capacity of the governments to act.\nAlthough economic activity began to recover in the second half of 2009, the financial and economic crisis then threatened to evolve into a public debt crisis in a third wave in 2010. In my view, this danger has not yet been averted. In recent days, we have been reminded all too clearly by the case of Ireland that the problem of over-indebtedness in the Member States has by no means been resolved, and I therefore also agree with President Van Rompuy: the failure of the euro is out of the question. That is the current situation, h", "Substances that deplete the ozone layer (recast) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Blokland, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on substances that deplete the ozone layer (recast) - C6-0297/2008 -.\nJohannes Blokland\nrapporteur. - (NL) Madam President, closing the hole in the ozone layer is important for the environment and for the public health of the population of the whole world. Our atmosphere is formed in such a way that there are two different layers that protect us. The CO2 in the tropospheric layer holds in the warmth so that we do not get too cold. The ozone in the stratospheric layer protects us from harmful UV radiation from the sun. The regulation on substances that deplete the ozone layer is primarily aimed at protecting the stratospheric ozone layer, but also at preventing climate change. Thus, those substances that are being prohibited act both to deplete the ozone and to increase global warming. The predominant substances that deplete the ozone layer are found in aerosol propellants, refrigerators, insulating materials and certain specific solvents and cleaning agents. The CFCs and halons that have the strongest ozone-depleting effect have been completely eliminated, save for a limited number of exceptions. It is already prohibited to produce HCFCs, and their use will be banned from 2020. The preamble to the new regulation states that the production and use of ozone-depleting substances is to be ended or minimised as far as possible. This is an important policy basis.\nSixty-four amendments were adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. There were then two trialogues, which resulted in an agreement between the Council and Parliament. This meant that the 64 amendments were replaced by a single, consolidated text. I would like to briefly mention nine important results of that agree", "Animal health strategy 2007-2013 (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Wojciechowski, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on a new Animal Health Strategy for the European Union (2007-2013).\nJanusz Wojciechowski\nrapporteur. ? (PL) The main idea on which the Animal Health Strategy is based is that prevention is better than cure, which is obviously the case. I am sure we all recall the problems related to BSE and avian influenza, when it proved necessary to cull millions of animals. That was a most unpleasant experience, and I am sure none of us ever wish to see it repeated. It did, however, indicate to us that we should improve cooperation at European level in order to improve protection of animal health. The latter is very closely linked to human health, owing to the possibility of direct or indirect transmission of certain diseases from animals to human beings.\nI should like to single out several points in my report for particular attention. Firstly, the promotion of better standards for animal health care. The report strongly emphasises the close link between the two. It is to be hoped that both will be prominent in future policy.\nThe second issue I wish to highlight is fair competition. European producers are required to comply with a great many veterinary standards, and with provisions relating to animal health and welfare. The same requirements are not imposed on importers, however. This is emphasised very strongly in the report. Our producers and those exporting animal products to the European market should all be subject to the same requirements. This represents a major challenge to our negotiators in the framework of negotiations at the World Trade Organization.\nMy third point relates to strong support for the vaccination programme. We believe it is an important instrument with which to reduce the number of cases of disease. A new approach is required too. Products originating from vaccinated animals should not be ", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of the last sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nFalconer\nMadam President, I notice from the Minutes that Mr Janssen van Raay has very kindly complimented me on my activities on behalf of the back-benchers in this Chamber.\nI would like to thank him for his kind words but I would also like to stress that my difference of view with the Bureau was not on a legal point but on a democratic point. I believe that discipline is a matter for the political groups. I do not believe it is the responsibility of Parliament as an institution. I also believe that any changes to the allowances payable to Members of this House from the time they were elected in July 1994 be put to the House, rather than imposed by any Bureau of 15 to 16 people.\nSo my point was different. I do not believe in pursuing these matters through legal channels. It is a democratic course which I am intent upon. But I would like to thank Mr Janssen van Raay for his kind comments yesterday.\n\nPasty\nMadam President, I should just like to point out that my name is not on yesterday's attendance register, although I took part in all the votes.\nI should be grateful if this could be rectified.\n\nGrosset\u00eate\nMadam President, my name is not on yesterday's attendance register, although I was present, and took part in all of yesterday's roll-call votes.\nMay I ask that this be rectified?\n\nHardstaff\nMadam President, item 1 of yesterday's Minutes states that I made clear that I had intended to vote against in most votes. I should like to make it clear that I actually did vote in both of those votes and voted against. But this was not registered in the Minutes.\n\nvan Bladel\nMadam President, I would also like to refer to the Minutes regarding what my friend, Mr Janssen van Raay, said about mandatory attendance at votes and the relevant sanctions.

Welcome, Prime Minister, to the European Parliament.\n(Applause)\nThe Prime Minister will make a statement to the European Parliament on the preparations for next week's G20 Summit. This summit meeting, which will take place in London on Thursday 2 April 2009, comes at a critical movement in the handling of the current international economic and financial crisis. It offers a vital opportunity for the leaders of both the industrialised world and the emerging economies to work together on a common agenda for immediate economic stability and longer-term recovery. The London Summit needs to agree on the macroeconomic policies and regulatory structures that can get us through the current crisis and put in place a better, more sustainable framework for the future.\nAs Chairman of the G20, Gordon Brown has been offering active international leadership at what is proving to be one of the most difficult times in recent history. The speed with which he has helped develop the G20 as a new tool of international economic governance is both encouraging and impressive. The Prime Minister has also made a strong and positive impact in showing how the United Kingdom can work effectively with its partners in the European Union, as together we find innovative solutions to the many challenges we face in common.\nI have always believed that it is vital that Britain plays a committed role as a central player in the European Union.\n(Applause)\nPrime Minister, we strongly welcome your determination to play such a role.\nI have great pleasure in giving the floor to the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown.\n(Applause)\nGordon Brown\nPrime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain", "4.

Cross-border exchange of information on road safety-related traffic offences (\nIn\u00e9s Ayala Sender\nMadam President, I will be very brief. I wish to thank my fellow Members who have agreed to my request, this time, on the urgency of adopting this agreement at second reading, but, above all, I want to convey to you the gratitude of the associations of victims and relatives of victims of traffic accidents on European roads, who have been waiting more than three years for this first step, which is crucial in order to prevent hundreds more deaths each year.\nI am conscious of the institutional generosity shown by the European Parliament with this exceptional and unique gesture on the inclusion of correlation tables, a matter of fundamental importance for the proper application of European law on which, thus far, the Council has shown neither the diligence nor the commitment required.\nHence, I turn now to the President-in-Office of the Council to declare that, having welcomed the positive indications from the new Polish Presidency in relation to our just demand that the correlation tables be included, we hope and trust that a swift horizontal solution will be achieved, both in the Council and in the Commission. In this respect, I hope that the Member States will ensure an adequate transposition and application of this rule, in the greater interests of road safety and of all European citizens.\nOlli Rehn\nMember of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to make a declaration on behalf of the Commission.\nThe Commission recalls its commitment towards ensuring that Member States establish correlation tables linking the transposition measures they adopt with the EU Directive and communicate them to the Commission in the framework of transposing EU legislation, in the interest of citizens, better law making and increasing legal transparency, and to assist the examination of the conformity of national rules with EU provisions.\nThe Commission regrets the lack of support fo", "Foot and mouth disease: lessons to be learned and proposals for the future\nPresident.\nThe next item is the report (A5-0405/2002) by Mr Kreissl-D\u00f6rfler, on behalf of the Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease, on measures to control Foot and Mouth Disease in the European Union in 2001 and future measures to prevent and control animal diseases in the European Union [2002/2153(INI)].\n\nKreissl-D\u00f6rfler (PSE)\n. (DE) Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with very warm thanks to all the colleagues who did serious work in the committee and on the report. I am especially grateful to our chairman, Mrs Redondo, to the secretariat, which did excellent work, to the scientific service, and to the Commission.\nFebruary 2001 saw what was no doubt the most serious outbreak of foot and mouth disease Europe had ever known. It affected Ireland, the Netherlands, France and, in particular, Great Britain. In Great Britain alone, where the epidemic indeed broke out, official estimates state that 6.5 million animals were killed in the course of combating it. Other sources mention up to 10 million. The Netherlands lost 285 000 animals and France, where there were four outbreaks, 65 000 of them. The consequences were catastrophic for everyone concerned. It makes no sense for any future policy on epidemics to be based solely on the slaughter of animals as a means of eradicating the virus, and no such approach will any longer be tolerated by the people of the EU.\nAt the beginning of this year, our Parliament set up a temporary committee - not, as some Members unfortunately persist in believing, a committee of inquiry - which had the aim of helping to create an improved policy that would work not only at EU level. One of our tasks was to use numerous public hearings and on-site visits to analyse the events in the Member States affected, to evaluate them fairly and take what we thereby learned as a means of drawing relevant conclusions as regards a Eu", "One-minute speeches on matters of political importance\nPresident\nThe next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.\nSimon Busuttil\n(MT) I would like to start by saying that I, too, congratulate the new Commissioner, Mrs Vassiliou. Madam President, the decision that we are going to take tomorrow to approve the granting of almost EUR 700 000 from the Globalisation Fund to 675 Maltese workers who lost their jobs with the companies VF and Bortex in Malta is a display of solidarity, and solidarity is a main pillar of the European Union. If the European Union means anything, it is this; that yes, the Member States should open up their economies and markets to competition, but at the same time they are not alone, and the European Union is there to facilitate challenges, to help us exploit them and to reduce the negative impact that may result from them. Madam President, today the workers of VF and Bortex have a better idea of what solidarity means and a better idea of what the European Union means, and I, from here, salute them.\nRovana Plumb\n(RO) The recent demonstrations in Ljubljana have brought to the forefront the subject of salary differences between women and men, as a negative factor in the achievement of the social cohesion desideratum.\n\nAlthough we have made important progress at the European Union level, there is still a 15% difference and, in Romania, a 13% difference.\nI would like to call attention to a problem that persists in the public sector, namely in the fields where mainly women work - healthcare, social assistance, education, light industry and public administration - which are some of the most poorly remunerated.\nI welcome the support Commissioner \u0160pidla has shown in the issue of eliminating salary differences and I believe it is necessary to accelerate the measures contained in the related action plan, especially Item 2 - salary differences as the main component of employment policies.\nMarian Harkin\nMadam President, I would like ", "Recent developments in bilateral trade relations with China (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on bilateral trade relations between the EU and China by Helmuth Markov, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade - B6-0129/2007).\nHelmuth Markov \nauthor. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to be able to introduce this subject on behalf of the Committee on International Trade. I would like to begin by thanking Commissioner Mandelson and his services, who have dramatically improved the flow of information sent to our committee regarding the various bilateral and interregional trade negotiations. The committee hopes that this style of cooperation will continue for international negotiations on partnership and cooperation agreements in which, as in the case of China, trade is a significant factor.\nOur trade relations with the People's Republic of China are of great importance for both sides. Last year, China took over from the USA as the largest exporter to the European Union. At the same time, the European Union's trade deficit with China rose to EUR 128 billion. The Committee on International Trade has been monitoring China's growing importance in international trade for some time now. As early as 2005, our committee chose to produce an own-initiative report on the subject: the first report ever produced on an individual trading partner. A second report looked at the consequences of the expiry of the quota system for the Chinese textiles and clothing industry. We should congratulate the rapporteurs - Caroline Lucas and Tokia Sa\u00effi - for their foresight two years ago.\nIn the European Union and developing countries, concerns about the textiles and clothing industry and the impact of opening the market to China have still not been allayed.\nThis uncertainty has been increasing as the 2005 Memorandum of Understanding is now due to expire. We need a clear statement about China's market", "The effects of the global financial and economic crisis on developing countries and on development cooperation (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is a short presentation of the report by Enrique Guerrero Salom, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the effects of the global financial and economic crisis on developing countries and on development cooperation -\nEnrique Guerrero Salom\nMr President, Commissioner, the financial and economic crisis is producing the bitterest, severest effects on emerging and developing countries, especially on the lower income ones. This crisis has slowed down the sustained growth that has been occurring in many of these countries over the last decade: economic growth that was creating jobs, helping to straighten out their public accounts, making it possible to bring down their foreign debt, encouraging the expansion of their business activity and, in addition, helping them to obtain more official development aid.\nThese countries had already been suffering in the years prior to the crisis, however: firstly, the food crisis, which endangered the survival of hundreds of millions of people; then, the energy crisis, which used up many of the resources of those that did not produce oil or gas; finally, the climate crisis, the effects of which on harvests and infrastructure harm the poorest countries most of all.\nThe financial crisis added to this fragile situation in which these countries found themselves. As the European Commission itself points out, having affected the developing countries and emerging countries, the third wave of the financial crisis damaged the poorest countries, turning this crisis, in theory an economic one, into a development, social and humanitarian crisis.\nIn fact, all areas of activity in these countries have been damaged. Economic growth, which will be much lower in 2009 than in previous years, has been damaged. Trade has decreased, which will weaken these countries' current account balances. Ther", "3.

Surely we can do it more cheaply than that!\nKathy Sinnott\nMadam President, here is a practical suggestion. One of the expenses is that we translate votes, but these are only numbers, so we need only one edition of the votes. We do not need to put them into every language because we are dealing with numbers, and the names are the same in every language. So we can cut expense there.

Common system of VAT as regards tax evasion linked to import and other cross-border transactions (\n- Before the vote:\nBart Staes\n(NL) I should like to revisit the vote on my report, which was at second reading. All the groups in Parliament had a political agreement with the Council to adopt a number of amendments so that this regulation could become a proper regulation.\nDue to the absence of many MEPs - more than 400 are absent - we have been unable to adopt the package of amendments, which requires a qualified majority of 393 votes at second reading. We only managed 387 of the 395 votes cast. Due to the absence of many fellow MEPs, we have had to break our agreement with the Council.\nI should therefore like to ask the Bureau and Parliament's administration to look into how we can salvage the situation at this point before Parliament goes into recess after 7 May, so that we can discuss and restore this situation during the next part-session.\nPresident\nI must say, Mr Staes, that we had already considered this issue, and that we are indeed going to look at this because it is a real issue and a real problem.\n", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nBogus\u0142aw Sonik\n- (PL) Mr President, the new directive on waste is intended to provide a basis for the creation of a society in Europe that is universally engaged in recycling. Some very ambitious aims are to be set for the Member States. Are the aims that we wish to set for ourselves not too ambitious, though, and can the Member States, especially the new ones, manage to meet the rigorous requirements? It is worth pointing out that the old Member States have had far more time to adapt their waste management systems to the stringent requirements, while the new ones are being forced to introduce legal mechanisms and build the necessary infrastructure a lot more quickly.\nThe proposal for a new directive on waste is causing much controversy in many European countries. I do not think we should be surprised, then, that it was so difficult to reach a compromise with the Council. During yesterday's debate, many MEPs said they were not happy with the compromise on the directive. I fear, though, that the introduction of still more stringent requirements could cause problems with the implementation of this law. The new directive on waste will force countries that have neglected municipal waste management to take decisive action. These countries will be forced to introduce legal and economic mechanisms in order for their effect to be one that stimulates rather than burdens the economy. The new directive should be a stimulus to the development of new ways of creating jobs. That is why I voted in favour of the report.\nGyula Hegyi\n(HU) Thank you, Mr President. The waste directive that we have now adopted contains compromises, and is therefore liable to come under attack from many quarters. I understand the concerns of all those environmentally-aware citizens who petitioned me, too, with requests not to support the directive. At the same, however, I should also point out that many of my private member's amendments, formulated in a prog", "Euratom-US cooperation agreement\nPresident\nThe next item is the report (A4-0074/97) by Mrs Ahern, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation between the European Atomic Energy Community and the United States of America (C4-0264/96).\n\nAhern\nMadam President, this report about the agreement on nuclear cooperation between Euratom and the US deals with two issues which have been, and I hope and trust will remain, very important to everybody in this House. One is the scandalous lack of the democratic rights of this Parliament of control over Euratom, especially when the latter is concluding agreements with third countries. This is a fundamental issue for this Parliament.\nThe United States Congress had to assent to this agreement, whereas Parliament did not even legally have the right to be informed. We cannot continue in this manner in the European Union. This is the second time that the plenary has dealt with this agreement with the US. I would remind the House of the resolution in March 1995 which was passed with a large majority. At that time negotiations with the USA were ongoing and the Committee on Energy, Research and Technology, with some effort, succeeded in obtaining information from, and starting a dialogue with, the Commission on this agreement.\nIt was in that spirit that this Parliament demanded that it should continue to be informed and involved in this and similar international agreements on nuclear cooperation, including consultation before the conclusion of the final agreement with the USA.\nIn my report I elaborate that after the resolution was adopted, the performance of Commission and Council was entirely unsatisfactory. The Commission and the Council apparently decided once more to go it alone as they had done most of the time before our committee enforced its initial, but short-lived, involvement. I am therefore calling on the House as a whole to remain as firm on its", "Order of business\nPresident\nThe final draft of the agenda for this sitting, as agreed by the Conference of Presidents meeting on Thursday, 19 April 2007, in accordance with Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been circulated.

This plan was drawn up without consulting the shareholders and has been imposed on them by the Paris Tribunal De Commerce (Court of Arbitration in Business Matters). The only choice open to them is to respond or not to a takeover bid, which will keep them forever sidelined when it comes to capital and, by extension, to business decisions, at the very moment when the business is becoming extremely profitable.\nThis is a shameful episode, and the silence of the French authorities is scandalous. All of this serves to dissuade people from investing in the economy, thereby leaving it to the mercy of the large, stateless, financial groups.\nDavid Martin \nin writing. I voted for this report as budget support is a great tool for partnership with developing countries, allowing them to take ownership of the use of development funds.

The following amendments have been requested to this draft agenda:\nTuesday:\nThe Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has requested that a statement by the Council and the Commission on the shipping accidents in the Black Sea be placed on the agenda for Tuesday afternoon, after Mr Leinen's report, with a corresponding extension of the afternoon sitting until 6.30 p.m. This would mean that questions to the Commission would not commence until 6.30 p.m. and would thus be half an hour shorter.\nWho would like to justify the motion?\nIf there is nobody to speak for or against this motion, that is the end of the matter.\n(The motion lapsed)\nWednesday:\nThe Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance requests that a statement by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Georgia be included and dealt with in a joint debate with the report by Mr Obiols i Germ\u00e0 and Mr Tannock, and that the afternoon sitting therefore be extended to 6.30 p.m. and questions to the Council shortened by half an hour. They also request that the debate on Georgia be concluded with the tabling of motions for resolutions and that voting on the matter be carried out during the November part-session in Brussels.\nWho would like to justify the motion?\nDaniel Cohn-Bendit\n(DE) Mr President, there is not much for me to justify: it is obvious to all what is happening in Georgia, and it is clear that we should include Georgia when we are discussing neighbourhood policy. This should be laid down, so that the Council knows what is what. Then we should quietly proceed with preparing a resolution, for I believe it is important that the European Parliament formulate a clear resolution on the events in Georgia. This should then be adopted in Bru", "Draft general budget for 2007 (Section III) - Draft general budget for 2007 (Sections I, II, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the budgetary procedure 2007.\nIn this debate we shall examine\nthe report by Mr James Elles, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2007 (Section III) [C6-0299/2006 - and Letters of amendment No 1/2007 (5733/2006 - C6-0000/2006) and No 2/2007 (9010/2006 - C6-0000/2006) to the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2007, and\nthe report by Mr Louis Grech, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2007 (Section I, European Parliament; Section II, Council; Section IV, Court of Justice; Section V, Court of Auditors; Section VI, Economic and Social Committee; Section VII, Committee of the Regions; Section VIII (A), European Ombudsman; Section VIII (B), European Data Protection Supervisor [C6-0300/2006 -.\nJames Elles \nrapporteur. - Mr President, thank you for introducing us to this first budgetary debate for 2007. At the outset I should like to thank all those who brought us to this stage, particularly those in the secretariat of Parliament's Committee on Budgets and those associated with it. Without them it would have been impossible to get ourselves to this state of preparedness.\nIn setting out the guidelines for the 2007 budget - one that is different from others in the sense that it has been the first budget in the new financial perspective - much of the first part of the year was spent in negotiating the result of the financial perspectives. Indeed it is a rare budget when we find that we do not yet have some of the programmes in place, because the multiannual programmes are in the process now of being completed as, let us hope, the Financial Regulation will be in place for the beginning of next year to be the basis for our operation.\nIn t", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 21 January 2000.\n\nAngelilli\nMadam President, allow me to remind you that tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the Cermis tragedy. Two years ago, in Cavalese in Italy, an American aeroplane from the Aviano NATO base cut through the cables of a cable car during a low-flying exercise which exceeded safe limits, causing the deaths of more than 20 Europeans. Since then, the victims' families, who have not had the consolation of justice, since the pilot responsible has not faced criminal charges, have been awaiting solicitous financial compensation from the United States at the very least.\nI therefore appeal to the President of this House and the President of the Commission for them to stand surety for immediate compensation from the U.S. authorities, and this is in order to uphold the rights of the victims' families.\n\nPresident\nMrs Angelilli, thank you. I have taken note of your comment.\n\nAgenda\nPresident\nThe next item is the order of business. Following a request to this effect, which I have received from a number of political groups, and following the meeting of the Conference of Presidents which has just been held, I propose that we add to the agenda a one and a half hour debate on a topical and urgent subject of major importance, pursuant to Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure, on the subject of the European Union' s reaction with regard to the talks in Austria on forming a government.\nIf you decide to add this debate to the agenda, it will be introduced by speeches from Mr Seixas da Costa, President-in-Office of the Council, and Mr Romano Prodi, President of the Commission.\nIs there anyone who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal?\n\nBar\u00f3n Crespo\nMadam President, I would like to express my support for the decision of the Conference of Presidents, and, since I publicly criticised the presidency in January, I would like to take this opportunity to ", "Statement by the President\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, last Thursday and Friday we had a very successful summit meeting of the Heads of State or Government of the countries of the European Union with the President of the Commission, the President of the European Parliament and our three Intergovernmental Conference representatives.\nWhilst I have no wish to anticipate the content of tomorrow's debate with the President-in-Office of the European Council, Jos\u00e9 Socrates, I would like to stress that, in the eyes of the European Parliament, the summit was a truly resounding success because the entry into force of the Treaty, which is scheduled for the start of 2009, will give our Parliament equal rights in almost all areas of legislation. We in the European Parliament have not wavered from the course we adopted for the Convention and followed in spite of the setbacks in the referendums in France and the Netherlands, and if this Treaty now materialises we shall have played a key part in its creation. We hope that the ratification process will be successfully concluded in all 27 countries of the European Union.\nThe signing of the Treaty will take place in Lisbon on 13 December, and on the previous day - the twelfth of December, as agreed with the Presidents of the European Council and the Commission - we shall proclaim the Charter of Fundamental Rights at a formal sitting here in Strasbourg. That will be a significant event.\nI would like to express my sincere gratitude for the work of our three representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference - Elmar Brok, Enrique Bar\u00f3n Crespo and Andrew Duff.\n(Applause)\nI am pleased to see that Enrique Bar\u00f3n Crespo is with us, but I cannot see the other representatives. In that case we shall defer the approval of the Minutes.\nDaniel Cohn-Bendit\n(DE) Mr President, I have a question for Mr P\u00f6ttering: will you still have the right to vote in this Parliament?\nPresident\nI am well aware that Mr Cohn-Bendit's thirst for knowledge knows no ", "Proclamation of consensus on humanitarian aid - The European Union and Humanitarian Aid (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on:\nthe Commission statement on the proclamation of consensus on humanitarian aid, and\nthe report by Mr Cornillet, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the European Union and humanitarian aid.\nLouis Michel\nMember of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Cornillet and congratulating him on his report, which identifies perfectly the challenges facing the humanitarian effort, and in particular on the fact that he also identifies perfectly the approaches to be taken in relation to European humanitarian action. This report is a vital contribution to the joint work by Parliament, the Council and the Commission to put in place the future European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid. Our common objective is to formalise in a joint declaration by the three institutions our vision and our common approach to humanitarian aid policy. There is no doubt in my mind that the active involvement of the European Parliament is essential for the success of this process to adopt the declaration.\nAllow me to reiterate very briefly the reason for this political initiative: basically, the humanitarian context has changed in recent years and we need to adapt to it if we want our humanitarian action to continue to be coherent and effective.\nWhat are the main changes and what are the main challenges? In my opinion, they can be summed up as follows. Firstly, there are more and more conflicts and natural disasters and their death toll is also rising. In particular, the natural disasters are often caused by climate change: the recent floods in Mexico reflect the reality and extent of this worrying trend.\nSecondly, we are also witnessing an increase in complex crises and significant changes in the nature of conflicts. The methods and means used in armed conflicts, for example, make the ", "European Council meeting of 15-16 June 2001 in G\u00f6teborg - Swedish presidency\nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on:\nthe European Council report and Commission statement on the European Council meeting of 15 and 16 June 2001 in G\u00f6teborg and\nthe statement by the President-in-Office of the Council, summing up the Swedish presidency.\nIt is my pleasure to give the floor to the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Persson.\n\nPersson\nMadam President, honourable Members of this important Assembly, allow me to begin first of all by thanking you for your constructive cooperation during the Swedish presidency. It is important for the European Union' s different institutions to support, inspire, criticise and cooperate with one another but never forget that we have a common mission to develop our Union.\nThe Swedish presidency' s objective was to proceed from important decisions to the implementation of those decisions. Our ambition was not to add new decisions but, rather, to implement decisions already taken. We wanted to concentrate on three areas, which I had the opportunity to talk about when I was in Parliament at the beginning of the presidency. These were enlargement of the Union and issues relating to employment and the environment. In addition, we wanted to develop the Union' s common foreign and security policy.\nI make no claim to provide a comprehensive review of the Swedish presidency in my report. Instead, I would offer some reflections upon the last six months. We have worked incredibly hard with the Commission in order to press on with the enlargement negotiations. The objective of this work was to show that the timetable drawn up by the Commission for the enlargement negotiations was realistic. We can now see that, during the Swedish presidency, we did everything we intended to do, and a little more besides. The very ambitious timetable drawn up by the Commission proved to be realistic. This was the basis for the European Council in G\u00f6teborg when we sa", "2. Iran: the case of Khadijeh Moghaddam\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution on the case of Khadijeh Moghaddam.\nPaulo Casaca\nauthor. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one of the darkest aspects of the theocratic Iranian regime is its misogyny. Since the Islamic revolution in 1979, the Iranian authorities have successively eliminated all the most important women's rights. Stoning, mutilation and violation of privacy and of the most basic rights are now the rule. Society is reacting increasingly clearly and forcefully to this situation.\nIn this context, the movement for a million signatures that began organising around two years ago in Iran is one of the most important manifestations of Iranian civil society's wish to demonstrate its opposition to the regime in power.\nIn the last two years, we have witnessed around 100 prison sentences and other punishments meted out to people who have signed the movement's petition. Today, after we submitted our motion, we were informed by various human rights organisations that three women activists from this movement - Nashrin Afzali, Nahid Jafari and Zeynab Peyghambarzadeh - have been sentenced to suspended prison sentences and whipping. This is an intolerable situation and I appeal to all my fellow Members to show their repudiation of the situation and express their support for Iranian women.\nErik Meijer\nauthor. - (NL) Mr President, Iran is a country where only people prepared to be terrorised by the military and conservative theologians can bear to live. Freedom, democracy and human rights have no meaning there. They do hold elections, but candidates have to be endorsed by the conservative clergy, so dissenters are by definition excluded. Many Iranians have fled the regime of terror in their country and many of them would no longer be alive if they had not done so. We should find room for these refugees in Europe instead of sending them back or treating them as terrorists.\n", "21. 2007 discharge: European Police College (\nChristofer Fjellner\nrapporteur. - (SV) Mr President, since Parliament has decided to grant discharge to the European Police College against the recommendation made by myself and the committee, I would simply like to urge my colleagues in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to accept the amendments tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament. There is no reason to justify why we would choose not to grant discharge or to delay discharge now that we have granted it. So that we can keep things consistent, I propose that our group support the Socialist Group's proposals and vote in favour of the next four amendments.\n", "\n\nMichael Gahler (PPE-DE ). \u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0 Mr President, having already had the experience yesterday lunchtime of the entrance to the Parliament building being blocked by Strasbourg\u2019s taxi drivers for three-quarters of an hour, I made the discovery this morning that German taxis, evidently on the instructions of our head of security, Mr Suarez, were no longer being allowed to drive onto Parliament\u2019s precincts, so that passengers had to alight from them outside. Moreover, one taxi driver told me that no reason had been given for this.\nI regard this sort of thing as an absolute scandal, and as discrimination, and I call on the House authorities to withdraw the order that people are no longer to be allowed in. I will also be ascertaining, in an hour\u2019s time, whether taxis are again being allowed to drive in. I really do wonder how it has come to pass that we in this place should give in to pressure from the street yesterday and prohibit taxis from driving on to Parliament\u2019s precincts in the way they used to. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The first thing I can tell you about that is that the possibility of some sort of instruction from within Parliament can be ruled out with absolute certainty. We cannot exclude the possibility that the French taxi drivers\u2019 organisations have been up to something. There will be official consultations about this, and the administration will be able to deal with it immediately. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is the presentation of the Court of Auditors\u2019 annual report for 2004. \nHubert Weber,\n\u00a0\u00a0 . Mr President, let me thank you, on behalf of the members of the European Court of Auditors, for the invitation to the debate on the Court\u2019s report \u2013 its 28th \u2013 on the financial year 2004, which I presented to the Committee on Budgetary Control yesterday evening. In this, my first year in office as the President of the Court, I am glad to be able to be present at the commencement of the annual process of giving discharge in respect of the handling of the EU\u2019s Budget.\nAmong t", "3. Human rights in Vietnam\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the six draft resolutions on human rights in Vietnam.\nMarios Matsakis \nauthor. - Mr President, Vietnam, a word synonymous with catastrophe, is a country that, as we all know, has had an extremely traumatic past, with long and treacherous fighting against colonialism, with a devastating civil conflict and with a calamitous war against the American forces having resulted in unprecedented suffering for the Vietnamese people. Then came the totalitarian Communist regime which, it has to be said, has made at least some proper efforts towards healing the wounds of the past and getting the country on its feet again. Consequently, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam was rewarded by the international community in various ways, including being allowed it to join the World Trade Organisation, but, unfortunately, there is still a long way to go to achieving an acceptable level of democracy for the Vietnamese people.\nWe are particularly concerned about new waves of persecution of dissidents and the suppression of the fundamental right of free speech. We are also very concerned about the lapses in reforms relating to freedom of religion and the various set-backs in achieving judicial reform, which should be fair and democratic and which should lead to the abolition of all forms of imprisonment without proper judicial safeguards.\nHoping that the human rights dialogue between the EU and Vietnam will, albeit the recent setbacks, lead to tangible improvements for the Vietnamese people, we call upon the authorities in Vietnam to take serious note of our concerns relating to the issue of violation of human rights in their country. At the same time, we call upon the Commission and Council to reassess the policy of cooperation with Vietnam, bearing in mind that this cooperation should be subject to respect for democratic principles and fundamental rights and reforms. Let this motion for a resolution not be seen as a threat,", "Framework for European Regulatory Agencies (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the framework for European regulatory agencies.\nPaula Lehtom\u00e4ki\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union and its citizens need effective agencies that work transparently. As you know, in order to promote this objective, on 28 June 2004 the Council adopted conclusions on the Commission communication on the operating framework for the European Regulatory Agencies.\nIn these conclusions, the Council focussed attention on the Commission's intention to put forward the proposal as a legally binding instrument, which would define the Regulatory Agencies' horizontal operating framework. It was the Council's opinion that the proposal should deal with such issues as the establishment, work and monitoring of regulatory agencies, to ensure, in particular, that there would be consistency, transparency, good governance, credibility and cost-effectiveness, and that their activities would be lawful.\nAfterwards, in February 2005, the Commission drafted an interinstitutional agreement on the operating framework for the European Regulatory Agencies. The proposal stated that the purpose of the interinstitutional agreement was to reinforce the horizontal framework for the establishment, structure, work, evaluation and monitoring of the Regulatory Agencies.\nWhen the draft was being considered at working group level, however, the Council, in April 2005, took the view that there could be no agreement on the issue in the form of an interinstitutional agreement, at least in terms of its content. Nor was it considered possible to admit any legal basis for the Regulatory Agencies, because there is none in the Treaty for a legal act of this kind. In Council discussions, various models were proposed for moving forward in this matter. There was no agreement, however, on how this could be achieved.\nDuring our Pr", "Adjournment of the session\nPresident\nThe Minutes of this sitting shall be submitted to Parliament for approval at the start of the next part-session.

European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (\nBefore the final vote:\nPeter Skinner\nrapporteur. - Madam President, for the same reasons as my colleagues and fellow rapporteurs have asked for a postponement, I too ask for a postponement on this report to give us the time that we really need to have a thorough discussion with the Council on whatever they come back to us with.\nI believe this can be a successful deal. I think this will help us today to have the strong position we need, even though we have converged from different directions, in order to be able to discuss that deal with Commission and Council.\n", "10. The organisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities (\n\u0160tefan F\u00fcle\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, the College will review, in the light of this vote, the possible options, including a withdrawal of the proposal. We will ask Member States immediately how they apply the working time rules to self-employed drivers and how they monitor compliance with these rules.\nPervenche Ber\u00e8s\n(FR) Mr President, I understood from the Commissioner's speech that the Commission will withdraw its proposal, which we rejected. If so, then it no longer needs to be sent to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.\nPresident\nI understood from what the Commissioner said that this option could be considered. If this is the case, then clearly you are right, Mrs Ber\u00e8s. If the Commissioner confirms that the Commission wishes to withdraw the proposal, then naturally, the Bureau, which I represent at this time, will not refer the matter to the committee responsible. Can you confirm, Mr F\u00fcle?\n\u0160tefan F\u00fcle\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, I indeed said that the College will review possible options, including a withdrawal of the proposal.\nPervenche Ber\u00e8s\n(FR) Mr President, in these conditions, and noting the degree of uncertainty confirmed in the Commissioner's response, I would request, under Rule 56(3), that this plenary express its view on the legislative proposal which henceforth rejects the Commission's proposal, and I would ask my fellow Members to confirm their vote by voting for the legislative proposal thus amended.\n(Applause)\nPresident\nYou are within your rights to do so, Mrs Ber\u00e8s. The rapporteur has requested the floor.\nEdit Bauer\nUnfortunately, I have to say that one of the possibilities is that an infringement procedure will be launched tomorrow against 25 Member States. I would like to ask that my name be removed from the report because I do not wish to contribute to this.\nPresident\nThere is, however, a proposal by Mrs B", "Signature of acts adopted under codecision: see Minutes\n\nDaniel Cohn-Bendit\n(FR) Mr President, the Lithuanian Parliament voted yesterday for a law on homosexuality, on propaganda on homosexuality and bisexuality. The Lithuanian President had already refused to sign this law. It was referred back to the parliament. This law is in direct opposition to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and Article 6(1) of the Treaty of Lisbon.\nI call on you, Mr President, on behalf of this Parliament, to protest against this law in the name of European values, since the Charter of Fundamental Rights, as reproduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, provides for non-discrimination in relation to sexual orientation, and this law discriminates against sexual minorities.\nOn behalf of this Parliament, I call on you to write to the Lithuanian Parliament to state that this law goes against the common idea of Europe.\n(Applause)\nPresident\nThank you. We proceed to a presentation of the order of business.\nDaniel Cohn-Bendit\n(FR) Mr President, can you tell me whether or not you are going to act? I have asked you to do something; you should tell me whether or not you are going to do it. That is what I asked you.\nPresident\nI will find out what the Lithuanian Parliament has adopted and then I will decide what to do. I will be in touch with you about this.\n", "The attack on Galina Kozlova, member of the board of the Mari national organisation Mari U\u0161em and editor of the literary magazine Ont\u0161\u00f5ko (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by the Commission on the attack on Galina Kozlova, member of the board of the Mari national organisation Mari U\u0161em and editor of the literary magazine Ont\u0161\u00f5ko.\nNeelie Kroes\nMember of the Commission. Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission regrets the violent attack on Galina Kozlova which took place on 25 January in the capital of the Mari Republic, and I express my sympathy to her and her family and my best wishes for her speedy recovery from her injuries. The Commission expects that the incident will be thoroughly and speedily investigated and the perpetrators brought to justice. In this context I note that an investigation has been opened and that the President of the Mari Republic has reportedly demanded that it be given special priority.\nMore generally, the Commission is aware of the situation of Finno-Ugric indigenous peoples, such as the Mari-El people in Russia. We are also aware of the concerns raised by a number of Members of the European Parliament concerning the treatment of the Mari-El, notably with regard to the Mari language in school teaching and the harassment of journalists and the presidential elections in December 2004. The Commission took good note of Parliament's resolution of May 2005.\nThe Commission sees common values, including the respect for human rights, as a cornerstone of its relations with Russia. The Commission participates actively in the EU-Russia human rights consultations, where we aim to discuss the most important issues with Russia in an open and constructive manner. It would be useful if we could, on issues such as these, move away from mutual recriminations and focus on exchanges of experience and best practice on how to deal with these problems, which can arise in many modern societies. It is for that reason that the Commission has", "Enforcement of intellectual property rights (criminal measures) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Zingaretti, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the amended proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on criminal measures aimed at ensuring the enforcement of intellectual property rights - C6-0233/2005 -\nG\u00fcnter Verheugen\nMr President, honourable Members, infringements of intellectual property rights are on a continuing upward curve and now constitute a really serious threat to the European economy and to European society.\nThe differences in sanctions applicable from one country to another not only interfere with the smooth functioning of the internal market but also make it more difficult to combat the counterfeiting and piracy of products. It is vital that the holders of rights should enjoy equal protection throughout the Community.\nProblems of consumer protection also arise in connection with health and safety issues. The Internet helps counterfeiters, who can use it to market faked or imitation products around the world without any loss of time; it is evident that their schemes are increasingly tied in with organised crime, and I have to say that the number of products that have had to be taken off the internal market has recently increased to a disturbing degree, being, as a rule, faked versions of other products, so action to address the problem of counterfeit goods is of the utmost importance to the Community, and the vote here in your House is an important step in getting it underway.\nThe Commission is glad that your House accepts and endorses the general principle underlying this amended proposal for a directive, and I should like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Zingaretti.\nAs long ago as 2006, when - on 7 September that year - it adopted a resolution on the need for immediate action against counterfeit medical products, your House has been supportive of the Commis", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nSepp\u00e4nen\nMr President, there is a clear error in the Minutes relating to Commissioner Bangemann's speech here. Mr Bangemann was to deliver two statements: on the Commission's position on transatlantic relations and on the Echelon system. Mr Bangemann did not mention the Echelon system in his speech and did not even say he intended to speak about it later. This can be checked from the verbatim report of the sitting. Consequently, it must be said that Mr Bangemann was in breach of parliamentary procedures when he failed to speak on the Echelon system, and only delivered one of the Commission's statements. Mr Bangemann was not at all prepared to speak about Echelon. He had nothing to say on the subject. He did not know anything about it. For this reason, I do not think that Parliament should accept that the Commissioner made a statement on Echelon. I propose that the Commission should be obliged to make a statement on Echelon once again, so that the issue is discussed properly and Members of Parliament can make speeches on the subject. I would like the Minutes to be changed regarding the matter of Mr Bangemann's speech, and the matter to be sent back to the Commission so that it can be settled.\n\nPresident\nThank you for your statement, Mr Sepp\u00e4nen. I do not actually think we are talking about violation of our Rules of Procedure, but there was a problem of communication between our services and those of the Commission, and as a result yesterday's debate did not take place according to the agreed procedure. So it is understandable that you and Members who were present during the debate you referred to were disappointed.\n\nKreissl-D\u00f6rfler\nMr President, unfortunately what Mr Sepp\u00e4nen said is true - there was no misunderstanding. Reference was made three times to the necessity of having an overall debate, and then we were told that it would be split into two pa", "Welcome\nPresident\nI would now like, on behalf of the whole House to extend a warm welcome to our visitors in the official gallery, namely Mr Igor Dodon, Minister for Economic Affairs and Trade of the Republic of Moldova, together with a delegation from the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova.\n(Applause)\nThe delegation from Moldova will be attending our sessions today and tomorrow and will be joining with this House's delegation in a session of the EU-Moldova Parliamentary Cooperation Committee.

In addition, there was no interpretation into Polish for a certain time, and that was not dealt with either. I would ask that we cease to be treated in this way.\nPresident\nMrs Tomaszewska, I am terribly sorry that your vote was not counted. I hope that this will not happen again.

Therefore, I am sorry that I am unable to give the Council's opinion on this matter, but I would like to remind you that the decision on any installation of any armed forces or military equipment rests within the national competence of each Member State. For that reason the Member States make decisions on such matters independently.\nAllow me to clarify: there have not been any discussions so far between the European Union and the United States of America on the installation of the anti-missile system. Also, neither party has planned for a possible cooperation in this area. The Council of the European Union did not therefore plan for talks to discuss this matter, either with the United States of America or with the NATO Alliance. As we know, anti-missile defence is a subject of cooperation within NATO as well as within NATO-Russian Federation Council.\nBenita Ferrero-Waldner\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, I will be very brief today, because the Commission has very little competence in this matter.\nBut let me say that interaction between the United States of America, Russia and the EU Member States in the areas of security and defence has wider implications for these important partnerships. That is clear. Therefore, although, as I said, we really do not have competence or responsibility in this question, we hope that a balanced solution can be found that is, in the end, satisfactory for all.\nWe have welcomed, from the very beginning, the high-level talks that started in Moscow last October, followed by expert meetings. And we see in the recent direct dialogue between Moscow and Warsaw an opportunity to clarify respective positions in r", "Welcome\nPresident\nI would like to welcome the delegation from Mexico comprising members of Mexico's Chamber of Deputies and Senate, who are present in the official gallery.\n", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 9 October 1998.\n\nStatement by the President\nPresident\nIt gives me enormous pleasure to be able to share with you all today my joy at the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to John Hume and David Trimble.\nOver the years the European Parliament has been constant in its support for the peace process in Northern Ireland. The road to peace is not assured. Just as the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to John Hume and David Trimble must fortify the people of Northern Ireland in their quest for peace, so must the award reinforce our own solidarity and that of the international community as a whole in the peace process. Here in the European Parliament we are proud to salute our colleague John Hume.\n(Applause)\nBanotti\nMr President, I appreciate and thank you for your kind words. I am sure all our colleagues will share our great joy and pride in this unique honour paid to John Hume and to David Trimble. After all the anguish and despair of the last 30 years this is a wonderful tribute to the consistent belief on John Hume's part that the non-violent path to peace in Northern Ireland was the only way. I would like to thank you and join with all our colleagues in expressing our great joy and support for John Hume and David Trimble in the work they are doing in Northern Ireland.\n\nOomen-Ruijten\nMr President, perhaps it would be a good idea to wait a moment until Mr Hume arrives so that we can say this on our groups' behalf whilst he is actually present.\nMr President, I think we should congratulate not only Mr Hume himself, but the whole Irish people too on the fact that the Good Friday agreement has created fresh opportunities for peace. I think it would be appropriate if Mr Martens, our group chairman, conveys his good wishes to him again in the House tomorrow, and through him our good wishes to all those who now have a chance to make peace a reality.\n\nPresident\nThank you, Mrs Oome", "Role of women in agriculture and rural areas (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Jeggle, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the role of women in agriculture and rural areas.\nElisabeth Jeggle\nMadam President, Commissioner, as Parliament's rapporteur for the own-initiative report on the role of women in agriculture and rural areas, it was my aim to conduct a broad public debate in order to give more visibility and weight to the important multi-functional role of women in rural areas.\nIt remains a key task of European rural policy to achieve equivalent living conditions in all regions, preventing the one-sided development of heavily populated urban areas, so that, even in rural areas, people can look forward to staying put and making a successful life. The focus of the common agricultural policy (CAP) over recent decades has been on the positive economic development of agriculture and rural areas. In future, it will be geared increasingly to shaping and furthering future-oriented rural areas.\nThis will require fresh efforts and new strategies by all concerned. It will be more necessary than ever to take account of the needs of women in rural areas and to utilise their potential. Experience shows that, in rural areas most particularly, quality of life and economic strength are linked to the presence of women and their involvement in a wide range of activities. It has become apparent in recent years that significant advances for rural societies generally result from support for women and women's projects. Findings to that effect have been gleaned from experience with such support under the second pillar of the CAP and various other EU funding schemes in all regions of Europe.\nHowever, women also have an essential role to play in agriculture. This is a sector where women have made a substantial contribution in recent years to business diversification and adjustment to the market, thereby advancing the practic", "5. Commemoration of 1956 Hungarian Uprising (vote) \n- Before the vote on Recital J:\nMichael Cramer\n(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although this resolution makes a connection between the Hungarian revolution and the other efforts at resistance in Eastern Europe, it makes no reference to the uprising on 17 June 1953 in the GDR, when, in over seven hundred cities and municipalities, people went on strike and mounted demonstrations, events that were put down by Soviet tanks. I would therefore like to insert the following in Recital J:\n'recognising the historical and political link between the Hungarian Revolution in October 1956 and various other forms of resistance and resistance movements, such as the mass demonstrations in East Germany in June 1953, the Pozna\u0144 demonstrations in Poland in June 1956, the Prague Spring of 1968, the birth of the Solidarity Movement in Poland in 1980 and democracy movements in the former USSR, notably those of the Baltic peoples;'\n(Applause)\n(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)\n", "EU guarantee to the EIB against losses under loans and guarantees for projects outside the EU (debate) \nPresident\nThe first item is the report by Mr Kalfin, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council granting an EU guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under loans and guarantees for projects outside the European Union - C7-0110/2010-.\nIvailo Kalfin\nrapporteur. - Mr President, the current mandate of the European Investment Bank for its operations outside of the European Union expires at the end of October. The European Parliament and the Council have to agree on the conditions for its extension beyond that date.\nParliament has discussed the issue very thoroughly over several months. During that period we discussed many ideas and tried to listen to the opinions of many stakeholders. We held dozens of meetings, both outside and within Parliament, between the political groups working on the text.\nI should like to take this opportunity to thank very much all my colleagues from the political groups, and the administration, for their dedication, their work based on the highest professional standards, and their endeavouring to achieve a broad consensus on a mandate for the European Investment Bank that will make a difference in fulfilling the EU's objectives. I also thank very much the European Investment Bank and the Commission for their constant support and advice, which was very valuable for our work.\nNow we have a draft decision to be voted by Parliament which provides for more coordination between the European Investment Bank and the other EU bodies, for more transparency and stakeholder participation, and for a better monitoring and reporting system: a decision that will improve the visibility of the impact of the bank's activities.\nWith this decision, we shall start elaborating the common EU position with the Council. The draft decision preserves the very successful profile of", "Implementation of the Research Framework Programmes (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Maria Da Gra\u00e7a Carvalho, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on simplifying the implementation of the Research Framework Programmes.\nMaria Da Gra\u00e7a Carvalho\nScience, education and innovation are the pillars of economic growth and job creation. Europe needs to invest more in science, open up its scientific systems, promote the free movement of researchers, and increase and promote excellence. In fact, today we are seeing an increasingly multi-polar world in all sectors, including science. A few figures are enough to demonstrate this fact: for example, at a global level, 80% of researchers work outside Europe, and 69% of patents are registered outside Europe.\nEurope invests less in science and innovation than Japan, South Korea and the US, and this difference is essentially due to investment from the private sector. Our system of science and innovation has weaknesses that need to be overcome, from underfunding to fragmentation, a lack of conditions for developing innovation, and excessive bureaucracy. The European scientific system needs to be more efficient, starting with the simplification of the rules for funding. In this context, I had the honour of being appointed rapporteur for the simplification of the rules for participation in current and future European programmes for science and innovation.\nThis report may play a vital role in Europe, and it comes at the right time, given that we are beginning the review of the Seventh Framework Programme and the preparations for the eighth programme. As the rapporteur, I decided to open up the debate on this subject and hold a public consultation. I sent out more than 8 000 invitations to a diverse range of bodies. There was an immense number of contributions, which shows the importance that our institutions and the public attach to this subject.\nThe report proposes the simplification ", "Enforcement of intellectual property rights in the internal market (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Marielle Gallo, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the enforcement of intellectual property rights in the internal market -.\nMarielle Gallo\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament must seize the opportunity of the vote on this own-initiative report, which is not my report but the fruit of numerous compromises, to open up a major debate. For almost 10 years, we have been repeatedly saying in all our texts that the European economy must be a knowledge-based economy. The explosion of the digital era means that we must now rise to this globalised challenge.\nThe creative and innovative industries currently provide 7% of the EU's GDP and 14 million jobs. Faced with severe competition, they are, and must remain, the key asset of the European economy. We therefore have to protect them, or else they will disappear.\nWhat apparatus can protect them? What apparatus encourages creators to innovate? What apparatus ensures European cultural diversity and its global spread? What apparatus ensures that our researchers, creators, artists, engineers and intellectuals are remunerated? What apparatus enables the economic sector of the creative and innovative industries to function and develop? What apparatus encourages SMEs and young creators to be enterprising and transform the European economy for the year 2020?\nThe answer to each of these questions is obvious: intellectual property law. Everybody agrees on intellectual property law in relation to physical assets. However, some of us have not yet woken up to what has been happening since the arrival of the Internet. They have not yet understood that all digital assets - music, films, books, video games, software - also need to be protected.\nWe must not be scared of the Internet. It is an extraordinary opportunity which we can welcome. We guarantee access to the Internet for all EU citize", "Statement by the President\nPresident\nI have several things to say as we begin. There are five brief points.\nThursday, 27 January, will mark the 66th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau German Nazi concentration and extermination camp. Every year on this day, we honour the memory of the more than 1 million people who were murdered there. This gives us the strength to work together to build a peaceful future for a united Europe, a Europe which will not experience such nightmares again.\nSecondly, on 13 January, the people of Lithuania celebrated the 20th anniversary of 'Bloody Sunday', when the Soviet army tried to overthrow the democratically elected government of the independent Lithuania. Lithuanians defended their liberty, and today enjoy equal rights as members of the Euro-Atlantic community. In remembering this anniversary, an anniversary which is important for Europe, we express solidarity, today, with the people of Belarus, who are also our neighbours, and who are still waiting for freedom and democracy to come to their country.\nThirdly, on 23 December 2010, the European Union ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Convention, together with the European Commission's disability strategy, will enable equal civil, political and economic rights to be guaranteed by 2020 to the nearly 80 million citizens of the Union who are affected by some kind of disability.\nFourthly, I would also like to reiterate that we are seriously concerned by the disappearance of the Chinese lawyer, Gao Zhisheng. According to the latest reports, he is being mistreated and subjected to torture. The European Parliament has already taken up Mr Zhisheng's case several times. Today, I would like to call upon the Chinese authorities to reveal the place where he is being detained and give details of his state of health.\nFinally, since our last meeting before Christmas, the Belgian Presidency has ended, and the leadership of the Eu", "Rights of patients in the EU (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the rights of patients in the European Union.\nMarkos Kyprianou\nMr President, the issue of high-quality health services is of great importance to all European citizens. Moreover, the right to healthcare is a fundamental right recognised by the EU Charter.\nNevertheless, health services are primarily national in nature. There is, however, broad consensus that there is a clear added value in cooperation on health services at European level. Together with the Member States, the Commission has been conducting a mapping exercise on common principles and elements of healthcare in the European Union. Special attention was paid to patients' rights.\nAccording to our preliminary results, there are indeed common elements of patients' rights shared by EU health systems. These include providing timely and appropriate healthcare, sufficient information to patients about different treatment options, respecting confidentiality of health data and compensation for harm from negligence in healthcare. However, the mechanisms in place across the Member States to implement these principles vary widely in practice. They range from patients' rights laws to non-binding patient charters, legal obligations for health professionals, patient ombudsmen, etc. Moreover, those mechanisms do not sufficiently take into account the situation of patients to or from other Member States. This is a particular area where Community on health services could help to improve the situation.\nAs Parliament is aware, we have recently launched a public consultation regarding Community action on health services. This public consultation explicitly addresses issues directly linked to patients' rights. Depending on the outcome of the consultation, issues relating to patients' rights could be addressed through proposals for Community action in 2007, whilst of course respecting subsidiarity. Whether this would be a legislative pr", "Revision of the framework agreement on relations between the European Parliament and the Commission - Adaptation of Parliament's Rules of Procedure to the revised framework agreement on relations between the European Parliament and the Commission (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on:\nthe report by Mr Rangel, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on revision of the framework agreement on relations between the European Parliament and the Commission, and\nthe report by Mr Rangel, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on adaptation of Parliament's Rules of Procedure to the revised framework agreement on relations between the European Parliament and the Commission.\nPaulo Rangel\nWith regard to these two reports, I would firstly like to congratulate and publicly mention, as I did at the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, the remarkable work carried out by my colleagues, Mr Lehne, Mr Swoboda, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, Mrs Wallis and Mrs Harms, who made up the team of Members of this House that negotiated this framework agreement with the Commission.\nI would also like to mention the great openness and highly constructive spirit of collaboration shown by the President of the Commission and, after the new Commission had taken office, Commissioner \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d and his teams. I believe that a remarkable piece of work has been achieved, and that this has led to an historic agreement that represents the first framework agreement following the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon, and the first framework agreement with a direct, explicit basis in the treaties, but specifically on Article 295 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\nActually, I would like to say that this agreement creates a highly transparent, greatly dynamic and extremely close association between Parliament and the Commission, and that it essentially represents a compromise: a balance between the respective visions of the two institutions on the new role that fa", "Community Customs Code - Customs 2013 programme (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the reports:\nby Mrs Fourtou, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the Community Customs Code (Modernized Customs Code) C6-0419/2005, and\nby Mrs Fourtou, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing an action programme for customs in the Community (Customs 2013) C6-0158/2006.\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs\nMember of the Commission. Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection as well as the other committees involved, and in particular Mrs Fourtou as rapporteur for the reports to be discussed tonight.\nThe modernisation of the European customs environment is an essential contribution to attaining the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy. It is a must if we want the European Union to remain an attractive place to do business and maintain the external competitiveness of EU companies. In this context, it is crucial to deepen the single market by making the EU a fully-integrated customs territory.\nThis reform is also critical if we want to live up to the challenges of globalisation and reinforce the role of customs in protecting our citizens and companies from security and safety hazards such as counterfeiting, dangerous goods or the devices of international terrorism.\nThe modernised Community Customs Code will provide the legal framework for the development of a simple and paperless environment for customs and trade based on the best use of information and communication technology.\nThe present Community Customs Code was adapted in 1992. Since then, it has undergone only limited changes. This means that the Code has not kept pace with the radical changes to the environment in which", "19. Multiannual plan for the western stock of Atlantic horse mackerel and the fisheries exploiting that stock (\n- Before the vote:\nPat the Cope Gallagher\nrapporteur. - Mr President, I note that Amendment 29 has been withdrawn by the Socialists for reasons that I cannot understand, so therefore - to ensure that we can vote on this - on behalf of the ALDE Group, I confirm that we will take over this amendment.\nI deem this to be very serious and would ask Members to consider the fact that, while many might not fully understand the science of this, if we do not accept the Socialist amendment and accept the PPE amendment, it means that we are going against the advice of scientists and are creating two total allowable catch areas within a single stock.\nI advocate that we vote against the PPE and that we adopt the Socialist report now that the Socialists have withdrawn the amendment, for reasons perhaps better known to some of those in the southern part of Europe.\nPresident\nMr Gallagher, in other words, you are invoking Rule 156(5), and you are taking over Amendment 29 as in the voting list, which means that we have to vote on it.\n", "One-minute speeches (Rule 150) \nPresident\nThe next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.\nZuzana Roithov\u00e1\n(CS) Mr President, it is now 19 months since Canada suddenly and unilaterally introduced visa requirements for citizens of the Czech Republic, which, as a Member of the EU, is not allowed to introduce a reciprocal visa requirement for all Canadians. President Barroso immediately stated that it was a Union and not a bilateral issue, but Commissioner Malmstr\u00f6m is unfortunately not addressing it as a priority, but only passively monitoring the bilateral negotiations. In response to my intervention, the Council said that the Union is not discussing reciprocity, as it has not yet received any proposals from the Commissioner. Czech citizens are thus de facto second class citizens of the EU as far as their rights are concerned, and it is surprising that Canadians continue to travel to the Czech Republic without visas.\nI would like to point out that the tardiness of the Commission also increases the risk that the Czech Republic will delay ratification of agreements between the Union and Canada. It has no other option for defending the rights of its citizens, since the EU is failing to put pressure on Canada. I would therefore like to demand, together with you, that the Commissioner deals with Canada without delay, and also stands up for Romania and Bulgaria. Are a common visa policy and the principle of solidarity no longer European values? Is the Commissioner aware of what is at stake today?\nPetru Constantin Luhan\n(RO) Mr President, the taking of psychotropic and psychoactive substances, which generally lies in a legislative grey area, is having much more harmful effects than the drugs which are currently known.

I would like to stress that our dialogue is now fully political and over the years it has dealt with many issues ranging from regional and international security to the day-to-day concerns of the citizens, in parallel with the increasingly active role played on the international stage by both the European Parliament and South Korea.\nMr President, please allow me to express our pleasure at this visit and at our increasing cooperation with the Republic of Korea, and we wish you a happy stay in Brussels. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is the Council statement on the Programme of the British Presidency, for which purpose I am going to give the floor to its Prime Minister, Mr Tony Blair, whom I welcome. I would like to remind you that, before today, the Conference of Presidents of Political Groups of this Parliament has had the opportunity to meet with the British Presidency in London; that gave us the opportunity to exchange a series of points of view with the Prime Minister on the way the United Kingdom is going to conduct its rotating Presidency of the Union.

(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last Friday, 20 October, I had the pleasure to host the informal meeting of Heads of State or Government in Lahti and the dinner that followed it, where the Russian President Vladimir Putin was our guest.\nBoth the meeting of Heads of State or Government and the dinner organised after it were a great success. These informal meetings of EU leaders are an excellent way of building political consensus to take the Union forward with regard to its key challenges.\nAt the summit we focused particularly on external energy relations. We also discussed immigration and the situation in Sudan/Darfur. A separate working session was devoted to ways of promoting innovation policy to guarantee the Union's competitiveness and economic growth. Developing innovation policy is crucial to EU competitiveness and our ability to keep good jobs in Europe.\nThe open and thorough discussions during the working lunch enabled us to close ranks for the dinner, despite the doubts that had existed in certain quarters. The atmosphere over lunch was excellent and the solidarity among the Member States could definitely be felt. We attached a great deal of importance to speaking with one voice, and I would like to call this determination to reach consensus the Spirit of Lahti.\nThe discussion over dinner with Russian President Vladimir Putin was very honest and frank. In addition to energy issues, we also discussed topical international issues and freedom of expression in Russia.\nThe meeting of Heads of State or Government held a comprehensive and broad debate on energy. The atmosphere was excellent and the basic message, despite slight diff", "3. Justice for the \"Comfort Women\"\nPresident\nThe next item is the five motions for a resolution on justice for comfort women.\nRa\u00fcl Romeva i Rueda  \nauthor. - (ES) Madam President, I have to say that, as the driving force behind this resolution, I am particularly satisfied that finally we have found the space and sufficient consensus to table it, because I sincerely believe that the subject deserved this, and much more.\nWe are talking about almost 200 000 women, euphemistically known as 'comfort women', who were forced to be sexual slaves during and before the Second World War by the Japanese Imperial Army. After 62 years, the survivors are still seeking justice.\nDuring their lives they have suffered from poor physical and mental health, isolation and shame, and often extreme poverty. So far the Japanese Government has not complied with international rules on reparation, which include restitution, compensation, rehabilitation and satisfaction, including full disclosure, apology and guaranteeing that the action will not be repeated. This is particularly significant given that Japan is one of the main donors of aid in post-war times.\nThere was, therefore, an urgent need to react and to point out, as the survivors do, that truth must be linked to justice, and that an apology is empty if it is not accompanied by an acceptance of responsibility. I would like to stress that this is not only about the rights of an individual victim, but about collective rights, which bring with them the responsibility to remember, so that this type of violation does not happen again.\nThis means that we must ask the Japanese to conduct an exercise in historical honesty and not only acknowledge the facts but apologise on behalf of their predecessors, and to compensate the victims.\nFinally, I would like to express my great respect and recognition for the women who had and continue to have the courage to speak out and demand justice, and for the organisations like Amnesty International that are", "Commemorating 11 July as a day of remembrance for the victims of the massacre in Srebrenica (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the declaration of the Council and the Commission on commemorating 11 July as a day of remembrance for the victims of the massacre in Srebrenica.\nAlexandr Vondra\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, Srebrenica, as we all know, was a horrible crime. The massacre of more than 8 000 Bosniaks in and around Srebrenica marks one of the darkest historical moments of Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the former Yugoslavia and also of Europe as a whole. It is without a doubt the worst atrocity in Europe since the Second World War.\nLooking back, much more could have been done, and earlier. Srebrenica was a collective failure of the international community, the EU included. That is a great shame and we deeply regret this fact. It is our moral, human and political obligation that a Srebrenica never happens again.\nMarking the 10th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre, the Council expressed its renewed condemnation of the crimes committed and extended it s compassion for the victims and their families.\nThe Council, recalling the UN Security Council resolutions 1503 and 1534, underlined that full and unrestricted cooperation with the ICTY remain an essential requirement for continuing progress towards the EU. The transfer to The Hague of the remaining fugitive indictees who continue to elude international justice would be a fitting tribute to the victims of Srebrenica as well as a major stride towards permanent peace, stability and reconciliation. Therefore, the Council remains determined that the perpetrators of crimes in Srebrenica and in Bosnia and Herzegovina in general, as well as elsewhere in the region of the Western Balkans, must be brought to justice.\nAt the same time, throughout history European integration has proved helpful to heal wounds and injustice of the past, so we need to concentrate on the future as well. The EU as the integ", "Pedestrian protection: Commitment by the European automobile industry\nPresident. -\nThe next item is the report (A5-0154/2002) by Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Commission communication 'Pedestrian protection: Commitment by the European automobile industry' [COM(2001) 389 - C5-0537/2001 - 2001/2216(COS)].\n\nHedkvist Petersen (PSE)\nMr President, every year, 42 000 people die on the EU's roads. This is a very big political issue for people within the EU. In the White Paper on Transport, the Commission writes that we must halve the number of people killed by 2010. In that case, we must be active, not passive. We must take all kinds of measures at all levels. Everyone must help, especially industry, because we know that this is what consumers are demanding. The case for safety is self-evident.\nHow, then, must cars be designed so that they cause as little harm as possible to unprotected road users? The proposal for a voluntary agreement which we have obtained from the Commission and which the automobile industry has negotiated is inadequate. It is amazing that the Commission has seen fit to accept it in its current form. It is not always clear how it is to be implemented, and the EEVC tests are not taken seriously, in spite of the fact that they have been developed over a period of more than 22 years.\nWe are concerned here with survival on the roads and life in our society, and we must therefore be careful. The subject has been difficult to deal with, and I wish to thank all the shadow rapporteurs in the committee for a very successful piece of work which has demanded a great deal from us all. There have been many different opinions on the subject, many lobbyists and many points of view from the committees. It is now important to proceed on the basis of road safety and consumer demands.\nWe had three alternative responses to the Commission. The first was to accept the voluntary agreement. The second was to", "Environmental quality standards in the field of water policy (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading by Anne Laperrouze, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on environmental quality standards in the field of water policy and amending Directives 82/176/EEC, 83/513/EEC, 84/156/EEC, 84/491/EEC, 86/280/EEC and 2000/60/EC (11486/3/2007 - C6-0055/2008 -.\nAnne Laperrouze\nrapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are presenting today at second reading is the outcome of teamwork, thanks to which we have reached an agreement with the Slovenian Presidency and the European Commission. For me, it was a real pleasure to work on seeking a compromise with my co-rapporteurs from the political groups. I was fortunate to have competent and experienced colleagues, who listened carefully and were present at the negotiating meetings. I would like to offer them my warm thanks, and I also want to thank the secretariat of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the political group advisers and my assistant, Sylvain Mar\u00e9chal.\nI am using the phrase teamwork because we did excellent work together with the representatives of the Slovenian Presidency, who took account of Parliament's recommendations, and with the representatives of the European Commission, who gave us answers that made it easier for us to understand this proposal for a directive. I think we can all recognise the fruits of our cooperation in the compromise amendments that will be tabled for the vote tomorrow. So I thank everybody for having helped me in my job as rapporteur on this technical dossier.\nI come now to the substance.

Lifelong learning for knowledge, creativity and innovation - 'Education and Training 2010 work programme' (\n- Before the vote:\nLjudmila Novak\nrapporteur. - (SL) It is clear from the joint report of the Council and the Commission for 2008 that some progress has been made as regards lifelong learning, but we cannot be satisfied with the achievements so far.\nSome of the greatest challenges are students dropping out of education at an early age, poor participation in lifelong learning amongst older and low-skilled workers and poor skills levels amongst migrant workers. However, a knowledge-based economy will need an increasingly better skilled labour force.\nI have stressed in my report that we need to improve the quality of education on all levels so that it can equip children and young people for autonomous, creative and innovative thinking and learning. Curricula need to be continuously modernised and the use of information technology increased amongst older people.\nLifelong learning programmes must be related to the economy and support entrepreneurship, enabling citizens to acquire the kind of knowledge that will help them establish, run and develop their own businesses. It is important to take into account local and regional needs, potentials and characteristics.\nI call on the governments of the Member States and the institutions of the European Union not to cut resources for education at this time of financial crisis, because high-quality education that is available to all sections of the population is the best weapon against poverty and the best tool for finding a solution to the crisis.\nThank you to all my fellow Members and to the Bureau for your cooperation.\n(Applause)\n", "Honduras (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Honduras.\nCarl Bildt\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, the world is a big place. I am grateful for this opportunity to focus somewhat on the situation in Honduras and the seriousness of the developments that we see there, not only for Honduras but for the entire region. I will try to be reasonably brief.\nSince the beginning of this particular crisis last month, the Presidency has condemned the military action that was directed against President Zelaya, who was democratically elected, in spite of everything else that can be said. That action was in violation of the constitutional order of Honduras.\nWe have called for the restoration of this constitutional order, in full, and urged all parties and institutions to refrain from violence or talks about violence and to strive to find a swift and peaceful solution.\nI think in much the same way as we expect, when we have problems in different parts of Europe, that it is the European Union that should take the lead and we would hope that the rest of the world would support our efforts, our policy has now been guided by giving support to the Organisation of American States in their efforts to find a solution through dialogue and compromise to the problems that they are facing.\nWe have a situation where none of our ambassadors at the moment are present in Honduras. We do not have any diplomatic contacts at the moment either.\nWe very much welcome the recent effort by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, to try to reconcile the differences that exist. So far that has proved to be - hardly surprising, one might say - a somewhat difficult enterprise. But I am encouraged by the news that there will be new meetings under the chairmanship of President Arias this Saturday. We can only encourage him to move forward with those efforts and we can only continue to urge both sides to be re", "Strengthening the European Neighbourhood Policy - Situation in Georgia (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is a joint discussion on:\nthe report by Raimon Obiols i Germ\u00e0 and Charles Tannock, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on strengthening the European Neighbourhood Policy; and\nthe Council and Commission statements on the situation in Georgia.\nRaimon Obiols i Germ\u00e0  \nRapporteur. - (ES) Madam President, I inherited the role of co-rapporteur of this report from our colleague Mr Beglitis, who is now a Member of the Greek Parliament, and I did so with a degree of trepidation, but I must now say that I am very satisfied with the result achieved. First, because of the good working relationship with my co-rapporteur Mr Tannock, and also because I have had the opportunity to work with a group of extremely competent assistants and officials, and finally because a high level of consensus was reached in the drafting of the report.\nIt has also been possible to accept most of the amendments, which were likewise submitted in a spirit of agreement, and I feel the outcome has been satisfactory.\nThe report supports the Commission document of December 2006 on the assessment and future development of the European Neighbourhood Policy and, having regard to the consensus reached, we can currently say that Parliament and the Commission share the same vision, the idea that the European continent and the Mediterranean are interdependent realities which cannot be viewed in isolation, and that the neighbourhood policy offers new channels for relations and for cooperation with societies facing common challenges and problems, as well as major opportunities for joint progress.\nThe report points up a number of aspects which can make the European Neighbourhood Policy as strong and as ambitious as possible. I shall quickly go through five of them:\nFirst, the principle of a broad policy schema in a framework of differentiation, a principle of differentiation, so that the European Neighb", "Voting time\nPresident\nThe next item is the vote.\n(For the results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)\nNigel Farage\non behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, on a point of order, under Rule 160 of the Rules of Procedure, our group has requested that we have roll-call votes today on everything, and I know that has excited some interest in the Chamber.\nJust by way of explanation, not just this group but many MEPs from all groups are deeply concerned about the method of voting that takes place in here. In fact, you yourself in the chair just a few months ago said we have made mistakes here, which, in a vote of this size, are statistically normal. We would argue that when we are voting on legislation there should not be any possibility of mistakes being made.\nPerhaps I would ask Members, when they are going through this lengthy roll-call procedure, to consider just how important voting is, and perhaps in the light of that we will get MEPs next month, when we vote on the EU Lisbon Treaty, to vote for an amendment to allow those 10 countries that promised their own people a referendum, the opportunity to do so.\nHannes Swoboda\n(DE) Mr President, I have only one request. Rule 159 of the Rules of Procedure states that 'Normally Parliament shall vote by a show of hands'. For this reason it would be right to examine whether the IND/DEM Group's motion to have all votes taken by roll call is consistent with the Rules of Procedure. I believe it is not. May I ask that this be done by tomorrow. I believe we shall be voting today as stipulated in the voting list, but I would ask that the question of legal admissibility be reviewed by tomorrow.\nMarco Cappato\n(IT) Mr President, two things: I think the television camera set up here should be moved to allow Mr Donnici - and all of us - to see the presidency and other colleagues. Let me also take this opportunity to welcome the decision by the European Parliament's Bureau to dedicate Parliament's press room to Anna Politkovs", "Explanations of vote\nPresident\nThe next item is explanations of vote.\nSiiri Oviir\n(ET) Mr President, inherent in the concept of Europe working together is the idea that, in principle, the euro area can only go in two directions: it can either become stronger or disintegrate. In the current economic situation, a practical and decisive political response is needed. I support the creation of the stability mechanism, and accordingly I also supported the report, which paves the way for a legal framework enabling the creation of this mechanism.\nMarian Harkin\nMr President, yesterday we voted on the permanent stability mechanism and we flunked it. Amendment 33, which would have given the fund the ability to purchase bonds on the secondary markets, was withdrawn. The Parliament, like the European Council up to now, refused to take the hard decisions. Yes, they are hard decisions, but these decisions will determine the future or the failure of the euro zone.\nOur heads are in the sand, like the proverbial ostrich. We do not just have a currency crisis; we have a banking crisis and we have a sovereign debt crisis. And yet we persist in putting sticking plaster on deep wounds.\nMy own country, Ireland, is shouldering intolerable debt, all because German, French, Irish, British and other banks - along with lax regulation and non-existent supervision - acted like casinos. Bad debt has become citizens' debt. I will not say sovereign debt, it is citizens' debt. All of this happened under the noses of the ECB, with interest rates that were totally inappropriate. Irish citizens are expected to deal with all of this. Nobody is prepared to face reality. The debt is unsustainable. We have been trying to buy time with bailouts. What we need is major restructuring.\nAnneli J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki\n(FI) Mr President, the creation of a permanent crisis management mechanism for Europe is justified in case of future economic and financial crises. No one wants crises, but they are bound to happen and we need", "Welcome\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to inform you that a delegation from the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea is present in the official gallery.\nI warmly welcome the Korean delegation, which is here to take part in the tenth European Parliament-Korea Interparliamentary Meeting. Mr Lee Sang-Deuk is leading the Korean delegation, which is composed of six members of the National Assembly.\nOur dialogue has developed greater depth and regularity in recent years. It has now become entirely political, covering a vast range of subjects from regional and international security to our citizens' everyday concerns, alongside the increasingly active role of the European Union and South Korea in the international community.\nWe are delighted to have these fruitful, stable and ever-deepening cooperative relations with the Republic of Korea.\n", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nDaniel Hannan\nMr President, it is curious that, whatever the crisis, the answer in this House always seems to be greater European integration. Most people beset by the economic squalls we have had in the past six months respond by seeing the situation as scary and possibly painful. However, in this House, we see it as an opportunity for more regulation, more unification and more harmonisation at EU level, as this report shows.\nThe problem with this is that the people making that decision will be shielded from the consequences of it. Living in their palaces and chancelleries, surrounded and cocooned in their motorised convoys, their chauffeured cars and their official banquets, they will not be paying the price that our constituents will as a result of these economic policies. It seems to me axiomatic that we should respond to the economic crisis with more flexibility and by allowing countries to tailor their interest rates to suit their needs. Instead, we are doing precisely the opposite.\nSimon Busuttil  \n(MT) I voted in favour of this report because it places heavy emphasis on the importance of solidarity, on the fact that a common asylum policy needs to be built upon solidarity. However, I would like to underline the fact that there are certain paragraphs in the report that I cannot go along with and that I would have voted against had we been given an individual vote. I would particularly like to highlight the issue regarding detention policy. I believe that we must be very careful when referring to the detention of asylum seekers because it is not simply a question of deciding to put a stop to detention once and for all and to have it apply to everyone. There are certain specific circumstances whereby the use of detention policy is, and will, always remain important.\nFrank Vanhecke\n(NL) Mr President, I voted against the Catania report, as I totally and utterly disagree with the Commission's recent proposals on asylu", "Voting time\nPresident\nThe next item is the vote.\n(For outcome of the vote and other information on the vote: see Minutes)\n- Before the vote:\nMartine Roure\n(FR) Madam President, you are going to think me bad-tempered, but I feel that such important reports, such important resolutions voted on by so few Members - and it is not those who are here, of course, who are to blame - frankly, I find the situation hopeless and, really, I do question our credibility.\nTherefore, personally speaking, I will not be able to accept there being so few of us for much longer, and, at some point, the question will have to be asked as to whether there should be a quorum. I am well aware that there have to be 40 Members before a quorum may be requested. Since there are just over 40 of us, this is difficult, but I still think that something will have to be done.\n(Applause)\nPresident\nAs fewer than 40 members have raised the matter, we shall proceed to the vote.\nMarios Matsakis\nMadam President, this has happened for the last five years. It is not just today that it has happened. It is a little bit too late to note it today.\nZuzana Roithov\u00e1\n(CS) I would just like to emphasise that this problem applies to socialists and possibly to some other groupings as well, but not to the European People's Party, which is aware of its responsibilities regarding this important topic and it is present here in significantly larger numbers than others.\nG\u00e9rard Onesta\n(FR) Madam President, you are absolutely right. The quorum procedure may be applied only at the request of 40 Members, or by the president of the sitting. Therefore, if you so wish, if you believe, as Mrs Roure said, that this debate is too important to be closed now, you yourself can now call for a quorum and have this vote dropped, if you think it worthwhile.\nMario Mauro\nauthor. - (IT) Madam President, I thank Mr Onesta but I think yet another attempt to save in extremis a terrorist who has been condemned many times over has been lost.\nBernd Poss", "Resumption of the session\nPresident.\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 4 September 2003.\n\nPresident.\nJust ten days ago, on the morning of 11 September 2003, Members heard the news of the tragic death of Anna Lindh, the Foreign Minister of Sweden. As a former President of the Council and as a friend to so many, she was well-known in this House.\nOn behalf of the European Parliament and in my own name I sent our most deeply-felt condolences to Anna Lindh's family, her friends and colleagues and to the Swedish people, for an insupportable attack on her person and on freedom and democracy in Sweden.\nAll who met Anna Lindh came to know and appreciate her exceptional qualities of warmth, intelligence and openness of spirit: she was the exemplary face of modern European politics. Today many will recall moments spent in her vivacious and always stimulating company. Many, I expect will recall her direct and unpretentious personality and style.\nShe was one of the very best. Our hearts and thoughts go out to her family, friends and loved ones. She will be greatly missed. I would ask you to observe a minute's silence to mark our respect.\n(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)\n\nAndersson (PSE).\nMr President, thank you for your sincere words concerning Mrs Anna Lindh. We grieve for Anna and miss her, in Sweden, Europe and throughout the world. As you said, our thoughts go first and foremost to her family, husband and two sons.\nAnna succeeded in combining the things we often talk about, namely family life, parenthood and a politically very active life. She had daily contact with her two sons. She went home for parents' evenings arranged at the school attended by her boys. She was an unusual politician of the very best kind: one day she was at the UN, the next day she was meeting other foreign ministers, and the day after that she was standing in the market square with immigrants to Sweden or engaged in a discussion with school", "7. Developing civil dialogue under the Treaty of Lisbon (\nChristopher Beazley\nMadam President, we do seem to be having rather a lot of roll-call votes at the moment, which is a little irksome for people like me whose machines are not working. Could I therefore record 'yes' votes for everything and ask for a technician?\n", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 23 October 1998.\n\nStatement by the President\nPresident\nI have to inform the House that since the closure of the last part-session, I have sent a number of telegrams on its behalf, expressing solidarity and conveying condolences from all the Members of the House - and I am sure I acted for all of them. First, to the Prime Minister of Sweden and to the Speaker of the Swedish Parliament, following the horrific tragedy in Gothenburg. As soon as the news broke, I sent messages to Sweden, expressing our solidarity and also our sorrow and horror at what had happened.\nSadly, just a few days later, I found myself sending another set of messages, this time to the governments of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua. Once again, I expressed Parliament's deep regret and the sadness felt by all its Members. As in the previous telegrams, I asked for our messages to be forwarded to the victims' families and to the relevant authorities.\nI should mention that authorisation has been given for a meeting of our Parliament's Delegation for relations with the countries of Central America and Mexico to be held this very afternoon. The delegation will meet the ambassadors from the four countries concerned and the Commission, to discuss the best way of helping these devastated countries.\n\nWelcome\nPresident\nI now wish to welcome the members of the new Northern Ireland Assembly to our Parliament. They are present in the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery and with them is the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, David Trimble. In the same way that the other day we were able to congratulate and show our support for our colleague John Hume we take the opportunity today to offer our congratulations to this man.\n(The House rose and accorded Mr Trimble a standing ovation) We wish the members of the new assembly a fruitful visit to Brussels and every success in the months and years ahe", "One-minute speeches on matters of political importance\nPresident\nThe next item is one-minute speeches under Rule 150.\nTiziano Motti\n(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, 5 May, is the Fight against Paedophilia and Child Pornography Day in Italy.\nIt is a moment of important reflection, introduced by Act 41 of 2009, on what is, unfortunately, a widespread and increasingly serious phenomenon, because today paedophiles are not old men who trick children in parks but people who circulate within an internationally organised structure and who use the most modern forms of technology, such as the Internet. Therefore, today, young people, boys and girls, are not even safe within their own homes any more.\nThat is why I hope that the European Union, too, will see fit to dedicate a day to this important subject, and it is also why I have submitted a written statement calling for the introduction of an early warning system to enable the police forces of the individual Member States to work in an organised manner and exchange a rapid flow of information. I hope that this initiative will be welcomed by the majority of this House.\nGabriel Mato Adrover\n(ES)Mr President, last week Europe missed a great opportunity: the opportunity to be the world leader in astrophysical research for the next twenty years. The European Southern Observatory decided, on the basis of reports which were far from transparent, that the European Very Large Telescope would be located in Chile and not in the Canaries.\nThis is a time to congratulate Chile, but also to reflect on whether in Europe everything possible was done to have a European installation, decided on by a European institution, with European funding involving an investment of more than EUR 1 billion, located in Europe rather than in the Americas.\nThe European Parliament was unanimous in its support for locating it in La Palma and I am grateful for that, but what did the Council do? What did the Spanish Presidency do? Did it hold any me", "Restructuring of the European car industry, in particular the Opel case (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the restructuring of the European car industry, in particular the Opel case.\nVladim\u00edr \u0160pidla\nMr President, honourable Members, I am very grateful that you have given me the opportunity today to comment on the situation in the European car industry in order to inform you of a number of aspects of our European response to the crisis and of the developments in relation to the General Motors Group. In so doing, I will comment on the industrial policy and social aspects, while my fellow Commissioner, Neelie Kroes, will take over when it comes to State aid law.\nTwelve million workers have a job that is directly or indirectly dependent on Europe's car makers. That is why, back in October 2008, the Commission met with all the parties involved - including both the Member States and the social partners - as part of the CARS-21 process, to discuss a common way to manage the crisis. The scrapping premiums and additional financial aid from the European Investment Bank (EIB) were discussed at the meeting, so as to prevent this important sector, from an employment policy point of view, from foundering in the maelstrom of the crisis.\nWe also need to act in order to ensure that the crisis does not jeopardise the achievement of our statutory requirements to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars by 2012. I will come back to this later on. Out of concern about developments relating to General Motors, the Commission called a political meeting of all the Member States back in January this year in order to provide transparency and to guarantee compliance with European legislation. Three such meetings have since taken place. Joint political arrangements were reached amongst the 27 Member States at these meetings, and these were also made public.\nThe first policy agreed was that a trusteeship solution coordinated by Germany was the right way to go in or", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\n I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 30 November 2000.\n\nAgenda\nPresident\nThe next item is the final draft agenda agreed by the Conference of Presidents on Thursday, 7 December, pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.\nTuesday:\n\nBar\u00f3n Crespo\nMadam President, firstly, please allow me to express, on my own behalf - although I believe I am expressing the opinion of the majority of the House and not just of my group - that I agree absolutely with the statement that you made at the time of the proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I believe that it is right to point out that this is of constitutional value to Parliament and I therefore congratulate you.\n\nSecondly, Madam President, I would like to ask you to explain to the House as clearly as possible, given the amount of contradictory information which has accumulated throughout the day, what the structure of the debate with the French Presidency will be in relation to the Nice European Council, and what approach will be taken to the participation of the President-in-Office of the Council.\n(Applause)\n\nPresident\nThe reports are certainly contradictory, Mr Bar\u00f3n Crespo. Presumably all the more so because the Summit ended in the middle of the night, which nobody had planned.\nI shall try to clarify the position. I was told before the Summit that the President of the Republic would attend together with the Foreign Minister. That is what I was told, but I shall seek more up-to-date information and I shall pass on your message.\n\nPoettering\nMadam President, thank you very much for taking the trouble to do this. Our information - and I wish to add straight away that I really cannot believe it - is that the President-in-Office of the Council, the President of France, will only be present tomorrow for 30 minutes in order to speak.

Are there any comments? \nDell'Alba (NI ).\n\u00a0\u00a0  Mr President, yesterday, the European press published the report on anti-Semitism commissioned by the European Monitoring Centre on Racist and Xenophobic Phenomena. This is a report whose existence was, until yesterday, denied by the Monitoring Centre itself and the Commission. Three weeks or so ago, we had the Eurobarometer, and now we have the extremely disturbing report on anti-Semitism, whose existence had been concealed. I would ask you to avail yourself of your rights and demand an explanation from the Commission during the current part-session, or to ensure that a debate can be launched on the matter during the next part-session in December. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 That will be a matter for the next part-session.\nAn additional change to the agenda of Thursday 4\u00a0December has been proposed: the inclusion in the vote of the report by Mr MacCormick (A5-0421/2003) on the request submitted by Giuseppe Gargani for the defence of his parliamentary immunity and privileges which was adopted under Rule 110a. \nSwoboda (PSE ).\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013 Mr President, the corrigendum to the agenda was originally meant to include the MacCormick report on the immunity of Mr Gargani, but the Secretaries-General agreed yesterday that we first, of course, had to have the opportunity of examining it. We cannot now retrospectively alter the agenda without the groups also having the opportunity to discuss it. I would therefore ask that it should not by some means be retrospect", "Statements by the President\nPresident\nI would like to give you some brief information. This morning, I returned from a two-day official visit to Russia. It was the first visit to this country by a President of the European Parliament for 12 years. In Moscow, I met President Medvedev, the Speaker of the Duma, Boris Gryzlov, the Speaker of the Federation Council, Sergei Mirnov, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Energy Minister. We spoke about EU-Russia relations in the context of the Partnership for Modernisation, and also about the negotiations relating to a new agreement between the EU and the Russian Federation. A range of other issues were addressed, including human rights. I also met representatives of civil society organisations, including Memorial, which was awarded the 2009 Sakharov Prize.\nAs you are aware, during my visit to Moscow, the gas dispute between Belarus and Russia escalated. I expressed my concern to the Russian authorities about the situation and called on the two sides to honour their contractual obligations concerning gas supplies to the European Union. I also pointed out that the relevant agreements between Belarus and Russia should contain appropriate clauses guaranteeing the delivery of gas to the European Union. It is vitally important to us that supplies are guaranteed. In addition, the Council and the Commission are currently analysing the situation, and representatives of those two institutions may possibly be able to give us an up-to-date assessment of the situation during this sitting. In any case, the dispute is ongoing and we are receiving new information every few hours.\n", "European Protection Order (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Jim\u00e9nez-Becerril Barrio and Mrs Romero L\u00f3pez, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on the draft directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Protection Order (00002/2010 - C7-0006/2010 -.\nTeresa Jim\u00e9nez-Becerril Barrio\nMr President, today is an important day for all victims, because today we shall adopt the European Protection Order, which is a significant step forward in terms of their rights. Victims are unfairly forgotten about, and it is paradoxical that aggressors often have many more rights and that there is more said about aggressors' rights than victims' rights.\nToday, Parliament will honour all victims, reminding those who believe that the borders will shield them while they persecute their victims, that this European Protection Order will protect all victims equally in the European Union from this day onwards.\nWe started working more than a year ago to achieve this objective and make progress with the area of freedom and security that was mentioned in the Stockholm Programme, and today we can say with a degree of pride that, although the path has not been easy, as many people have frequently failed to understand the order, and doubted its effectiveness and clarity, we have achieved it.\nI must say that, following the trialogues with the Belgian Presidency, and many conversations with the Commission, we have achieved a text that almost all the political groups were happy with. This report was therefore adopted by a huge majority with no votes against in the joint vote by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.\nI hope that today, Parliament will reflect the decision made by those committees and by those of us who produced this report, which was adopted by a huge majority.

That is, the 50th anniversary of the 1956 uprising was being celebrated in Hungary. That celebration, however, took quite an odd turn because the people were not allowed to participate. One of the high-ranking guests present, an Italian deputy prime minister, said that these celebrations left the people out.\nMeanwhile the people on the street who wanted to celebrate peacefully were brutally attacked and beaten up. The police caused serious injuries by shooting rubber bullets at head level, and they pushed people off the streets. Peaceable passers-by, who wanted to celebrate 1956 peacefully, were not allowed to do so. What a shame, what a shame this was in the middle of Europe. I call upon everyone who strives for human and civic liberties not to support this policy.\nCatherine Guy-Quint\n(FR) Mr President, I would take the liberty of speaking once again on the subject of the Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor. They are still in Tripoli, in the prisons of the Libyan State.\nYou know, as I do, that they are imprisoned under false accusations. The review of their trial was supposed to conclude at the end of October. However, in October, the court again postponed its decision, this time until 19 December. The court says that it is beginning to take into consideration the opinion of international experts, who tirelessly bring evidence of the innocence of the accused.\nMr President, could we not demonstrate again the great interest that we take in the fate of these prisoners who have been tortured and have been absent from their homes for eight years for having treated young Libyans? This situation cannot be tolerated, as, month after month, they are pr", "Agenda\nPresident\nAs regards the draft resolution by the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka, I have received a written objection to the inclusion of the said draft resolution from Robert Evans and 40 other signatories.\nIn accordance with the provisions of Rule 90(4) of the Rules of Procedure, the draft resolution is included for debate and vote on the agenda of the current session.\nI therefore propose to you that the debate this evening be included as the last item, and the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon. The deadline for tabling amendments is 3 p.m. this afternoon.\nRobert Evans\nMadam President, on Monday evening, the Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted a motion regarding the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka, pursuant to Rule 91.\nThe situation in Sri Lanka is clearly very serious, but exactly what is happening regarding the humanitarian situation is far from clear. I am conscious that there are many differing views across this House. So I suggest that the most sensible course of action would be to timetable a proper debate, which cannot seriously be fitted in in this part-session but could be in our next part-session, which is just 10 days away. I am grateful to Mr Daul of the PPE-DE Group for indicating his group's support for this course of action. As we are a serious Chamber, I suggest and ask colleagues to support a debate with resolution and full participation at the next part-session, to do justice to the gravity of the situation in Sri Lanka.\nDaniel Cohn-Bendit\n(FR) Madam President, when someone proposes something, someone may always speak against it prior to the vote.\nI therefore wish merely to say that the situation in Sri Lanka is extremely tragic. There are 150 000 people trapped with no way out. This is exactly the same as in Burma. This is why Sri Lanka should be left on the agenda today, to show our determination to support those who are trapped.\n", "China (debate) \nPresident\n\u03a4he next item is the Council and Commission statements on China.\nCarl Bildt\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, another debate of, needless to say, some importance. And, although the subject is China, it of course takes place against the background of some significant developments in Xinjiang in the western part of China. I know that these events have been followed by many Members of this Parliament as well as our respective national parliaments throughout Europe.\nWe have also, as a Council, expressed our concern over the reports on the unrest there and called for restraint on all sides and for the situation to be resolved peacefully. I think it is time for us to say that we attach great importance to human rights. We also profoundly regret not only the loss of life but the destruction of property and everything else that we have seen happening and we can only condemn those that are responsible for it, whoever they are.\nBut let me also take this opportunity to take stock somewhat more widely of our relationship with China, a country with which we have an extraordinary range of complex relationships. In fact, when we decided in 2003 to set up those relationships within the framework of a comprehensive strategic partnership, we were committing ourselves to an extremely ambitious enterprise, and this is very much reflected in the broad and wide-ranging relationship which we have with China today.\nComplexity of course brings opportunities. It also brings challenges of different sorts. What we have tried to do with this relationship is to open it up to the point where we can discuss frankly and openly any concern that we might have on either side. The basis for such an open dialogue is the shared interest that we have in developing our relationship, our shared interest in global peace and stability.\nWe pursue this through dialogue and through multilateralism. We have the annual summit meetings and we have fairly frequent meetings", "Tobacco smoke: policy options at EU level (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Florenz, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Green Paper 'Towards a Europe free from tobacco smoke: policy options at EU level'.\nKarl-Heinz Florenz  \nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I am glad that the European Union is again discussing tobacco consumption. In my country alone, 350 people die every day as a result of tobacco consumption so it is only right that we deal with this topic at European level. I am very glad that the committee decided to launch a European initiative to continue to promote a ban on smoking in restaurants, cafes and pubs, and public buildings. I think this is the right approach.\nWhether there needs to be European legislation or national legislation that would then perhaps be established within the European framework is a matter for debate. Those who still believe that we do not need it should bear in mind that, in relation to the Air Quality Framework Directive that we passed here a few weeks ago, we argued about whether we would accept 20 or 25 ppm of fine particulate in the air. Commissioner, the figure in the average pub is 540 grams and after midnight at the 'Aviateur', a popular pub in this area, it is 1 730 grams, so you see how great the differences are and how necessary this is.\nAnother very important point, which has concerned me for many years, is additives. Even now, 600 additives may be included in cigarettes, and 70-80 of these are on the 'red list'. These are highly toxic, carcinogenic substances which may damage our young people's fertility and trap them in addiction. These substances require very critical, intense scrutiny, the cost of which must, of course, be borne by the manufacturers. The thought of Commissioner Kyprianou having to spend his last penny on tests made necessary by that industry is deplorable. The question of costs must therefore be settled, by placing", "Green Paper on urban transport (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission communication on the Green Paper on Urban Transport.\nJacques Barrot\nMr President, earlier on I presented these proposals on urban mobility to the College of Commissioners and I am pleased to be able to give a first taste of them now to the European Parliament.\nThe United Nations is preparing for the International Conference on Climate Change, which will take place in Bali in December. Yesterday, there was a preparatory meeting of Heads of State or Government in New York, during which the European Union unveiled its highly ambitious proposal: to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\nUrban transport is one of the areas where efforts must be made. Pollution from private and public urban passenger and freight transport represents 40% of CO2 and 70% of other pollutants that come from our roads.\nThe Green Paper that I am presenting before you today is the result of an initial intensive consultation that began in January and continued until June: consulting institutions, city representatives, stakeholders and citizens. What we took from this consultation was a strong willingness from stakeholders to put the issue of urban mobility on the European agenda. Local authorities and towns and cities in Europe should not be left to manage this challenging situation on their own.\nIt is not my intention to impose central solutions, ill-suited to local circumstances. Rather, the Union role, in partnership with all parties, is to identify obstacles to urban mobility and find ways of removing them. The European Union must raise awareness of this issue and lead the way if necessary.\nIn what terms should we rethink urban mobility? Personally I believe there to be five fundamental objectives. First of all, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, free-flowing towns and cities. Throughout Europe, increasing traffic in town and city centres leads to permanent congestion. The economic consequences of urban traffi", "Statement by the President\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, before we begin the session, I would like to say a few words. As you know, 10 days ago, the President of Poland, Lech Kaczy\u0144ski, signed the Treaty of Lisbon. I am certain we are a step closer to completion of the ratification process. I am also sure that ratification will soon be completed, too, by the Czech Republic.\nI would like to inform you that this week, on Tuesday at 15.00, our first Question Hour with the President of the European Commission, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, will take place. This debate represents a significant institutional change. It will make the European Parliament's work with the Commission significantly better. I have worked on this matter with the Chairs of the political groups and President Barroso, and am pleased that the new procedure will become a permanent feature of plenary sessions in Strasbourg. I am sure that it will make our debates more lively and open up our discussions even further.\nLadies and gentlemen, on 10 October, we observed the International Day for the Abolition of the Death Penalty. Since 2007, this date has also been European Day against the Death Penalty, when we demonstrate our determination and commitment against this inhumane practice. We also present our position in support of a worldwide moratorium in accordance with the declaration of Parliament made in a resolution in 2007, and the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly.\nIn a press release on 9 October, I stressed, in my own name and on behalf of the European Parliament, our commitment to creating a Europe without capital punishment, and also for its abolition everywhere in the world. This is our common obligation. Unfortunately, there is still one country in Europe where the death penalty is pronounced and carried out. That country is Belarus. We condemn the carrying out of executions in Iran, and we express particular fears for Iranians who have been sentenced to death following the demonstratio", "\n\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is the debate on the Commission Statement \u2013 the Northern Dimension.\nCommissioner Michel has the floor on behalf of the Commission. \nLouis Michel,\n\u00a0\u00a0   Mr\u00a0President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted about the opportunity offered to us in this Chamber to debate the policy relating to the Northern Dimension and to do so in advance of the meeting of ministers on 21\u00a0November, which will be devoted to this issue.\nThe Northern Dimension is an integrated policy of the European Union. Its purpose is to encourage dialogue and practical cooperation in the northern parts of Europe comprising the Baltic region and the Arctic and sub-Arctic areas of our continent. It is designed to ensure the general well-being of this vast region endowed with many natural resources and to do so by means of effective and long-lasting regional cooperation. It also makes it possible to overcome the divisions experienced within a region whose constituent parts have very many shared characteristics and which has to face common challenges on both sides of the borders of the states concerned.\nNorthern Dimension policy has moved on considerably since its launch in 1999, when it was officially inaugurated by the Helsinki European Council. The Feira European Council of June 2000 then incorporated the initial action plan for the Northern Dimension, extending over the period 2000-2003, into the European Union\u2019s external and cross-border policies. The Brussels European Council of October 2003 supported the second action plan in favour of the Northern Dimension, which entered into force on 1\u00a0January\u00a02004 and covers the period 2004-2006. This second plan took account of the European Union\u2019s enlargement, set for 1\u00a0May\u00a02004. Since that date, eight of the nine Baltic Sea states have been members of the European Union. The ninth is the Russian Federation. Even before that, Northern Dimension policy had placed ever greater emphasis upon relations and cooperation with North-West Rus", "Amending Budget 1/2010 (Section I, European Parliament) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Vladim\u00edr Ma\u0148ka, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the estimates of revenue and expenditure for Amending Budget 1/2010 (Section 1 - European Parliament)\n.\nVladim\u00edr Ma\u0148ka\nWe all know full well that it is only through joint efforts at the European level that we will manage to meet the greatest challenges of the 21st century, which are climate change, the risks and cost of raw materials and energy, economic globalisation and threats to our security.\nIf Europe is to confront these problems, it must have effective and complex instruments at its disposal. The Lisbon Treaty will provide such instruments.\nIn December, we approved the budget of the European institutions for 2010. For reasons connected with the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty, our work on the budget was not completed in December and it will continue into April. Today we are in the initial stage of the treaty coming into effect, and the EU will need to have adequate funding at its disposal from the outset in order to implement the new policies. The Lisbon Treaty has an impact on the entire range of services of the European Parliament and other institutions. As far as the European Parliament is concerned, codecision making will increase dramatically, covering up to 95% of legislation. Areas such as freedom, security and justice, agriculture, fisheries, research and structural funds have been added. There will be greater use of qualified majority voting in the Council and the creation of a number of new legal foundations in areas such as tourism, sport, energy, civil defence, administration and cooperation. This will all increase the legislative activities of the EU generally, with a significant overall impact on the powers of the European Parliament and its activities, and therefore also on the need to strengthen the administration.\nThe main priority of the amending budget proposed by the Presid", "8. Trade and economic relations with China (\nBefore the vote (concerns Amendment 1):\nCorien Wortmann-Kool\nrapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to move an oral amendment in the form of an addition to paragraph 64a. That addition reads as follows: 'where this does not require statehood, for instance, in the ILO'.\nSo the last part of paragraph 64a will read as follows: 'supports Taiwan's participation as an observer in relevant international organisations where this does not require statehood, for instance, in the ILO;'.\nI would ask colleagues not to oppose this oral amendment, because it is important for the Socialists to give their support to this resolution, and broad support is very important in order to send a strong signal to the Commission and to China.\n", "Use of information technology for customs purposes (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Alexander Alvaro, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the French Republic with a view to adopting a Council Decision on the use of information technology for customs purposes (17483/2008 - C6-0037/2009 -.\nAlexander Alvaro\nMr President, I would like to welcome Commissioner Kallas and my fellow Members. Fundamentally speaking, the issue we are about to discuss is not a controversial topic at all. The matter at hand is the adaptation of information technology in the field of customs and excise. For many people, this is a terribly technical topic. However, with respect to the fight against fraud and other crime, it is a very important aspect of cooperation in the field of customs and excise, and the exchange of information.\nWe have been able to work successfully together with the Swedish Council Presidency, and I would therefore like to thank those who have supported and accompanied us throughout the process, as this dossier is not exactly a new one. We have demonstrated our cooperation through the fact that Parliament has taken on and voted on in committee significant amendments, which the Council had already proposed in the course of its work. I therefore also assume that the vote on the matter this week will have a positive outcome.\nThe only measure on which Parliament does not agree is the extension of Europol's powers in this field. This view is certainly not reflected in all political groups in this House. However, it is in the final result of the vote on the report on information technology in the field of customs and excise. This is, to a certain extent, linked to the debate which was held here previously, when our intention was different, namely to send a signal that, having fairly recently defined a mandate for Europol, under which it was to be an agency, its powers in a number of small and specific are", "EU-Russia Summit (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on the EU-Russia Summit.\nManuel Lobo Antunes\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the 20th EU-Russia Summit will take place on Friday of this week in the Portuguese town of Mafra. This represents, in our opinion, an excellent opportunity for the leaders of both Russia and the European Union to take stock of our relations.\nWe believe that relations between the European Union and Russia are generally good and certainly much better than the international press would sometimes have us believe. Russia is a key partner for the EU and we take our relationship very seriously. The summit will tackle the situation in the EU and in Russia. We will report on developments in the European Union, in particular on progress made in drafting the new Reform Treaty which has just been adopted in Lisbon and on the energy liberalisation package proposed by the Commission and adopted on 9 September.\nAs for the common spaces, we will review the progress made in implementing the road maps. This process continues to be wholly positive, although some areas need to be driven forward. In certain important sectors, the Permanent Partnership Council (PPC) has helped to achieve this objective. The PPC on Culture, which will be held the day before the summit, will help to intensify our cultural cooperation.\nIn terms of priorities for the summit, we intend to reach agreement on the launch of the early warning system in the energy sector, on which agreement in principle was reached at the last summit held in Samara. Given the interdependence of the European Union and Russia in terms of energy, confidence must be increased and mutual cooperation reinforced. We will therefore highlight the objectives and principles that the EU must respect in relation to our energy partnership, in particular reciprocity, transparency, openness and creation of a", "1. Nomination of the Bulgarian Member of the Court of Auditors (vote) \nBruno Gollnisch\n(FR) Mr President, I should like to invoke the Rules of Procedure. I feel obliged to point out - as I said a moment ago - that the report by Mr Pom\u00e9s Ruiz is not available in French, or, to be more precise, the version of this report presented as the French version contains the biography of the candidate as well as a reply to questions exclusively in English, which seems to me to violate our Rules of Procedure.\nPresident\nMr Gollnisch, since you are a stickler for the rules, I am going to do you the favour of giving you the only reliable information: you are absolutely right, we should have full translations of all texts put to the vote. And that is actually the case. All of the texts put to the vote are available in all languages. Annexed documents themselves are not in any way put to the vote, according to our Rules of Procedure, and are not therefore subject to translation in their entirety. Now you are fully informed!\n", "\nButtiglione\nMadam President, I requested the floor in order to express the profound dissatisfaction of a number of Italian Members - most probably all the Italian Members and, I imagine, the dissatisfaction of the majority or the whole of this Parliament as well - at the statements made by President Ku\u00e7an yesterday. We fully approve his condemnation of Slovenian nazi and fascist oppression which he expressed in his speech before the European Parliament yesterday, but we cannot accept his failure to condemn the horror of anti-Italian ethnic cleansing perpetrated by the Communist regime immediately after it came to power. In particular, we cannot allow the massacre and eviction of the Italians to be described merely as a measure intended to combat collaboration with nazis and fascists, in the spirit of Potsdam and Yalta which divided Europe and from which Europe has had to regain its freedom and unity and is still in the process of doing so.\nThe events in question were a series of crimes against humanity in which the methods of ethnic cleansing that, tragically, have recently been employed in other parts of the Balkans, were developed for the first time. Italy is well disposed towards the Slovenian population and supports the entry of Slovenia into NATO and the European Union. We were of the opinion that the 1995 Solana agreements had provided a fair solution to the Italy-Slovenia disputes. We cannot understand why President Ku\u00e7an is putting forward fresh interpretations of past events which are totally unacceptable and harbouring unfounded fears regarding the future. Yesterday, President Ku\u00e7an issued a statement via the Slovenian Embassy saying that the controversy was caused by translation errors and that it was not directed at Italy but at Austria. Well, in our opinion, an action contravening human rights, which is a crime, is just as reprehensible whether it is directed at the Austrians or the Italians.\n\nMadam President, I call upon you to take steps to inform th", "18. Food enzymes (\n- Before the vote:\nAvril Doyle\nrapporteur. - Mr President, due to transport difficulties in reaching Strasbourg, I was not in a position last night to thank colleagues, particularly fellow rapporteurs \u00c5sa Westlund and Mojca Dr\u010dar Murko, and indeed my colleague Pilar Ayuso, who stood in for me in the debate, and all our respective assistants and staff for their cooperation over the last 12 months, in reaching a very satisfactory second-reading agreement on this important package on food measures. I hereby thank them all.\n", "Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nValdivielso de Cu\u00e9\nMr President, I simply wish to refer to the official status of Strasbourg, a wonderful city which nevertheless has a series of defects. Yesterday, I left home before 1 p.m. and arrived here just before 8 p.m. I had been moving from airport to airport. Then, fortunately, the City of Strasbourg provides a service to bring us here, but it consists of a bus which picks up a large number of passengers and we end up wasting a lot of time. I believe that this is a great city, where we should perhaps all meet once a year, but the rest of the time we should act in a pragmatic manner, take a practical approach to finances and work in one single headquarters, where we should all be located. This is much more sensible, much more rational, and I believe that that is how we should view it and, while we should praise this great city for its official status, we have to operate efficiently.\n\nDoyle\nA similar problem. I omitted to sign last night as I was travelling all day and arrived a bit late last evening. I would appreciate it if you would consider me as having been present when it comes to the Minutes. I was in Strasbourg yesterday evening but I omitted to sign.\n\nPosselt\nMr President, I got to Strasbourg on time yesterday but last week my flight was delayed by several hours getting to Brussels, then I had to wait an hour and a half for a taxi, and to cap it all I fell victim to the train strike. I would ask you to take note of that as well.\n\nEsclop\u00e9\nMr President, I would also like to support what has just been said, and indeed I would very much have liked to have been present at the start of yesterday' s sitting since, coming from the region that has just suffered this disaster in the south of France, I would have liked to have actually been able to hear the President' s words on the subject.\nIn addition to these few wor", "Situation in Nigeria (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Nigeria.\nG\u00fcnter Gloser\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, the situation in Nigeria is of great significance for the stability of West Africa and, ultimately for that of the continent as a whole.\nThe latest elections in Nigeria turned out very disappointingly, as the Council indicated in its statement of 27 April; there were numerous irregularities and acts of violence, with up to 200 people being killed and many more than that injured or intimidated, and the Council expects the persons responsible for these acts of violence to be called to account for their actions. It is fortunate, at any rate, that there was no evidence in these elections of religious or ethnic conflicts.\nThe elections took place within an improved legal framework, with substantial funds being made available, and all this led us to expect that the 2007 elections would pass off better than those held in 2003. While we are still awaiting the final report from the EU's election observation mission, initial assessments give credence to the suspicion that the 2007 elections were an even more badly run affair than their predecessors in 2003.\nThe main problems were in the lack of organisation exemplified in particular by the late opening of polling stations, the lack of ballot slips and the lack of secrecy around the voting process. What was even more serious was that, in addition to widespread irregularities, there was visible evidence of considerable electoral fraud.\nAnother major problem with the elections was that failure to publish detailed results from them, with, moreover, those results that were available not being calculated in comprehensible ways, and we should now ask the Nigerian authorities to publish the results with the figures broken down according to the polling stations where the votes were cast, for thi", "Resumption of the session\nPresident.\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 15 May 2003.\n\nPresident.\nI have a number of announcements which I would like to make to the House\n\nPresident.\nAs regards the calendar of part-sessions for next year, I have received from the Conference of Presidents a proposal to hold an eleventh part-session from Monday 3 May to Thursday 6 May 2004.\nThe deadline for tabling amendments to this proposal is tomorrow, Tuesday, at 4.00 p.m.\nThe vote is scheduled for Wednesday at 12 noon.\n\nHeaton-Harris (PPE-DE).\nMr President, I know you are respecting Parliament's wishes concerning the number of part-sessions and our votes at previous plenary sessions on where they should be held, but could you confirm where we are going to have the meeting on 1 May 2004? A number of political groups and parties within this Parliament will decide how they vote on the eleventh plenary and its siting. Their vote will determine whether we meet in Brussels or in Strasbourg on that particular day. There is a precedent for us to meet in Brussels because the part-session on Saturday, 2 May 1998, when Parliament gave its verdict on the Ecofin decision on which Member States should join the euro, was held in Brussels.\n\nPresident.\nI regret that I am not in a position to give you a clear answer, because the current position of the Conference of Presidents is that there is no plan to hold a meeting on 1 May. I regard the absence of this event to be most unfortunate, but that is the current position. There is currently no proposal before us regarding a meeting on that date.\n\nLehne (PPE-DE).\nMr President, I would just like to ask you to check whether, for legal reasons, a fully valid part-session is possible at all after 1 May, as the new Treaty of Nice stipulates 732 as the fixed number of Members. However, as far as I am aware, there are 788 of us. I would be interested to know how the qualified majority is meant to be worked out if t", "Decision on urgent procedure\nPresident\nFirst of all, we shall vote on the request for urgent procedure on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania for the period 1 August 2008 to 31 July 2012 - C6-0199/2008 -.\nMr Morillon has the floor to give the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries.\nPhilippe Morillon\n(FR) Mr President, this request - some here in this House are bound to recall, Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council - relates to the fact that at the end of last year we had to renegotiate the practical arrangements for the implementation of this partnership agreement with the Republic of Mauritania.\nThis renegotiation required close collaboration between the Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, Louis Michel, and Commissioner Borg, and I applaud this. It resulted in the setting up of a Joint Committee, which has, in agreement with the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, come up with an agreement that now satisfies both parties: the European Union and the Republic of Mauritania.\nThat said, it is now a matter of being able to pay the emoluments due to the Republic of Mauritania from 1 August. In agreement with all the political groups, we are asking the Commission if the vote on this report could take place not during this part-session, but during the July part-session. This is simply to allow our appointed rapporteur, Mrs Fraga Est\u00e9vez, to explain the exact terms of this report to us on the afternoon of Wednesday 25 June, so we can vote on it on the morning of Thursday 26 June, therefore making it possible to put it on the agenda of our next plenary in July. I think this should be satisfactory to all three partners and, of course, to the Republic of Mauritania.\n(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)\n", "Patient safety (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Sartori, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a Council recommendation on patient safety, including the prevention and control of healthcare associated infections - C6-0032/2009 -.\nThe rapporteur cannot be here and will be replaced in the initial introduction by Mrs Grosset\u00eate.\nFran\u00e7oise Grosset\u00eate\nMr President, yes, I am replacing Mrs Sartori, who is in fact detained in Italy, and I pass on her full apologies because she was particularly keen to be present here today.\nWe are going to speak mainly about medical procedures because, sometimes, they can have harmful consequences for patients' health, whether because of the undesirable effects of medicines, because of medical error, or because of infections contracted in the place of medication.\nOf these risks, we can mention more particularly nosocomial infections, which affect one in every 20 hospital patients, in other words 4 100 000 people a year. The European Commission figures on this issue are, moreover, very worrying.\nAdverse events occur among 8% to 12% of hospital patients in the Member States of the European Union. This gives an annual number of between almost 7 million and 15 million hospital patients, to which can be added the some 37 million patients who call on primary healthcare.\nNosocomial infections alone affect on average one in every 20 hospital patients, making a total of over 4 million patients a year. In total, every year, nosocomial infections cause the deaths of around 37 000 people in Europe.\nIn order to meet the objective of reducing these infections by 900 000 cases a year by 2015 - in other words a 20% reduction - the Member States and the European institutions are being called on to introduce the necessary measures.\nThe report recommends in particular: promoting the education and training of health staff and paramedical staff, with particular attention being pa", "Annual report on the deliberations of the Petitions Committee 2008 (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is a short presentation of the report by Mrs McGuinness, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions during the year 2008.\nMairead McGuinness\nrapporteur. - Mr President, by its very nature this report contains a great deal of statistics. You can look at, read and analyse those, but obviously the work of the committee throughout the last 12 months is there on view.\nThis committee that I sit on is a peculiar committee of Parliament. It has very direct links with citizens and it deals with problems raised by individuals and groups. Yes, people come to this committee with problems that we very often cannot solve, but at least they have a port to call on and, where cases are inadmissible, we try to redirect.\nWe deal with many, many problems from across Member States but, as the statistics show, some countries use the services of the committee more widely than others, perhaps because there are members of the committee who are from those countries and therefore they attract problems from their constituents. I am always fascinated by the reality, particularly in an Irish context, that sometimes people complain that Europe is too powerful and yet, when they have a problem and turn to Europe for help, they sometimes complain that Europe is not powerful enough. I think that is quite significant.\nThe Petitions Committee works, in my view, on the basis of 'soft power' and I think the work of the last 12 months has been about trying to influence Member States who are not implementing legislation in the manner that they should to change their ways. But we can only work by virtue of the people who come to us with problems and address them and their particular needs.\nI want to talk about some of the issues we dealt with, not in detail but just to give a flavour. Obviously, the environment is the major area where complaints c", "Signature of acts adopted under codecision: see Minutes\nBernd Posselt\n(DE) Mr President, in connection with the coordination of the calendar, a document has been distributed in which an election date is shown in blue for the first weekend in June. You know yourself that all European elections since 1979 have been held on the second or third weekend in June. I would like to ask who decided, and when they decided, to move next year's European elections forward to these new dates around the first weekend in June.\nPresident\nWe shall minute your point of order, Mr Posselt, and we shall provide you with an answer in the appropriate manner.\n", "5. Voluntary modulation of direct payments under the CAP (vote) \n- After the vote on the Commission proposal\nNeil Parish \nChairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - Mr President, I should like to ask the Commissioner whether the Commission will withdraw its proposal.\nFranco Frattini\nVice-President of the Commission. (IT) I shall, of course, report back to the College of Commissioners on the outcome of today's vote.\nNeil Parish \nChairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - Mr President, I do not think that the Commission has cleared it up terribly well, but I think it is not withdrawing its proposal, and so we need to clarify the legal situation. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has presented the second report on voluntary modulation after the referral of the first report back to committee in November 2006, under Rule 52(3) of the Rules of Procedure. As no agreement was possible with the Commission, the committee has had to reiterate its position, so we are dealing here not with a new report, where Rule 52(3) may be applied again, but with the confirmation of the first report.\nThe Legal Service of the European Parliament, with which I have consulted on this issue, has informed me that, in our specific case, the last sentence of Rule 52(4) has to be applied mutatis mutandis, which means that we have the vote on this legislative resolution and that a second referral to committee according to Rule 52(3) is not appropriate, so we are not referring it back to committee.\nI propose, therefore, that the House should vote in favour of Parliament's legislative resolution because we have already rejected the Commission's legislative proposal. Therefore, the ball is now firmly in the Commission and Council's court. We await a new proposal with great interest.\n(Applause)\nPresident\nI am going to try to summarise this clearly. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is proposing that, instead of referring the ", "31. Machinery for pesticide application (\nBefore the vote on Amendment 39:\nLeopold J\u00f3zef Rutowicz\nIn July 2006 the Commission presented a strategy the objective of which was to reduce the general risk and adverse impact of pesticides on human health and the environment. The last element of that strategy is the proposal for a directive on machinery for pesticide application, amending Directive 2006/42/EC on machinery. The directive sets out the requirements with which the machinery for application should comply in order to limit the adverse effects of pesticides on the environment, the operator and the surroundings. Establishing these requirements will reduce the differences between regulations and the procedures followed in some countries of the Community concerning the application of pesticides, ensure a uniform level of environmental protection in the Community, and enable free flow of these machines in the EU market, which is especially significant for small and medium-sized enterprises, which are most often the producers of this type of equipment.\nThe draft of the proposal and suggested amendments were the subject of discussion during workshops, at meetings with representatives of the Council, the Commission, shadow rapporteurs and interested parties, and during tri-partite talks. In view of the large technical differences between different types of machine - from simple, hand-operated ones to those operated by qualified personnel - some of the amendments were not adopted and it was decided that they will be contained in standards developed by the European Committee for Standardization at the request of the Commission. Thanks to this a consensus was achieved, Amendment 39 was adopted, and this position has been confirmed by the Council.\nI would particularly like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, representatives of the Commission and the Council, the administration of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection and interested parties for their help an", "Opening of annual session\nPresident\nI declare the 1997-1998 session of the European Parliament open.\n\nApproval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of the last sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nPasty\nMr President, I would like to point out that I was present yesterday. I am not on the attendance register. I probably forgot to sign in but I took part in the roll-call vote, which you can check.\n\nMedina Ortega\nMr President, Mr Pasty is not on the attendence list for the same reason that that my name and the names of at least fifty people are not on the list today. I have discovered that I appear under a different name: Mayera Ortega. But that applies to most Members. For example my good friend Mr Falconer appears as Falconero; my colleague from our party Mr D\u00fchrkop D\u00fchrkop is down as Donnerp D\u00fchrkop. The President of Parliament has come out half intact as Gil-Roblee instead of Gil-Robles. Mrs Bennasar Tous is down as Bazinrsar Tous and Mr Cohn-Bendit is down as CoatesBendit. I have the impression, Mr President, that some wicked virus crept into the attendance list yesterday.\n\nMartens\nMr President, I am now called 'Marcet s' .\n\nMcGowan\nMr President, it is simply that I do not find my name anywhere, despite the fact that I signed in. You had better check the lists as well, please.\n\nPoettering\nMr President, this business is even more bizarre. I have just seen in Wilfried Martens' Minutes, i.e., in the Dutch edition, that my name is listed, although spelt rather oddly, but it is listed. Let me state quite explicitly that I was not present yesterday, did not put my name down on any list and am not claiming the daily allowance!\n\nFontaine\nMr President, just to say that unlike Mr Poettering I am not listed, yet I am absolutely sure I signed in and took part in the debate.\n\nPompidou\nMr President, my name was not misspelt, for the simple reason that it does not appear in the Minutes even though I was not in two places at once and was sure I was there yester", "Statements by the President\nPresident\nI would like to make several statements at the beginning of this part-session.\nOn 6 November 2010 in Moscow, unknown assailants inflicted a savage beating on the journalist Oleg Kashin. This brutal assault, which was not motivated by robbery, deserves the most severe condemnation. We note and welcome the swift reaction of President Medvedev in this situation and his personal commitment to finding the perpetrators, and we hope this will be effective.\nSecondly, on 31 October, and for the first time in two years, an opposition demonstration was held in Triumph Square in Moscow without the police intervening. We take this as a promising signal from the Russian authorities, in the hope that the appeals of the European Parliament made over the years for further democratisation of public life in Russia have not gone unheeded.\nThirdly, 10 days ago in Baghdad, an attack was made on Christians who were at prayer in their church. Some people were killed, and others were injured. On behalf of the European Parliament, I reiterate my call for respect for freedom of religion and for an end to the religiously motivated violence which is being witnessed in this part of the world.\nFourthly, on 10 December, a ceremony will be held in Stockholm to award this year's Nobel Prizes. We consider unacceptable the attempts made by the Chinese authorities to put pressure on Member States of the European Union not to participate in the ceremony. The European Parliament strives unremittingly for the fundamental and inalienable rights of every person throughout the world to be respected, and we do not, of course, make exceptions for China. At the ceremony in December, the head of the European Union delegation in Norway will represent the European Union and, therefore, the European Parliament too.\nLuigi Berlinguer\n(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent days, the Veneto region of Italy has been hit by serious natural disasters, in particular, the pr", "European environmental economic accounts (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on European environmental economic accounts - C7-0092/2010 -.\nJo Leinen\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating, and tomorrow we will adopt, European legislation that, on first impression, seems rather unremarkable, but with this law on European environmental economic accounts, we are probably opening a new chapter in the measurement of progress and prosperity.\nWe have known for a long time that gross national product is inadequate. The purely quantitative view of economic activity says nothing about the environmental balance sheet, nor about the social balance sheet, and therefore it is high time that we measured whether, year on year, we are doing well or badly in terms of our measures and efforts.\nWe have monthly statistics relating to our labour market figures and we have annual statistics relating to our economic figures. We therefore know exactly what is happening in these areas. However, we have an incomplete patchwork of data on the environmental impact. This law on environmental economic accounts is intended to help us to draw up an accurate balance sheet in the 27 Member States and to establish whether we are making progress or, as is often the case, whether we are going backwards.\nAs long ago as 2002, Parliament called for reliable information to be collected on the state of the environment and the most important trends in, influences on, and causes of, environmental change, and for the public to be informed of these things. We want a scientifically sound concept for measuring the consumption of resources to enable appropriate political decisions to be taken.\nWe are pleased that the Commission took this legislative initiative in April 2010, but in our opinion, it was m", "Comitology (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on comitology.\nMargot Wallstr\u00f6m\nVice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the comitology reform that was decided in July 2006 introduced a 'regulatory procedure with scrutiny', which gives a veto right to the European Parliament on measures of general scope that amend a basic legal act adopted under codecision.\nIn the framework of this reform, the three institutions concluded a joint statement in which they committed themselves to adapt 26 priority basic acts to this new procedure, and the Commission adopted 26 priority alignment proposals at the end of last year. It is in our common interest to have these alignment instruments adopted as soon as possible. The Commission is therefore very pleased to see that Parliament is now ready to vote on several legislative resolutions, after having reached good and fair compromise solutions between the three institutions.\nOther important dossiers will be on the agenda of another session of the European Parliament later this month, and I am confident that we will be able to settle these dossiers as well. I want to thank the rapporteurs from the different committees for their very cooperative and constructive approach.\nConsequently, the whole package of the 26 priority alignment proposals could be ready for adoption before the end of this year. This would be a very good result which will pave the way to the so-called 'general alignment'. As you know, the Commission made a commitment to review all existing codecision basic legal acts, in addition to these 26 priority acts, with a view to bringing them into line with the new regulatory procedure with scrutiny. The Commission will respect this commitment and propose this general alignment of all non-priority acts. It concerns in total more or less 220 acts. This will take the form of four to five omnibus or package proposals, the first of which should arrive in the European Parliament shortly in Novemb", "6. Pregnant workers (\nEdite Estrela\nMadam President, I should like to ask the services to take into account that the Portuguese version is authentic for all amendments.\nSecondly, I should like to ask that the order of voting be changed, and that Committee Amendment 43 be voted on before Amendment 83 for the sake of coherence.\nFinally, I would point out that this directive that we are going to amend is 17 years old and is clearly out of date. The revised directive will not enter into force before the end of the next legislative term. In other words, we are legislating for the future, not for today.\nIn particular, we are legislating for the good of the citizens, thereby giving them more reasons to vote in the June elections.\nI will therefore end by asking my fellow Members to support my report.\nAstrid Lulling\non behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Madam President, as things stand at present, there are 89 amendments to this report. It is totally chaotic, and the vote that we are going to take will not allow us to hold a truly objective debate with the Council and the Commission. These 89 amendments are all totally at odds with each other. I propose we refer this report back to committee because, as Mrs Estrela said, we have plenty of time to do so.\n(Loud applause)\nPresident\nMs Lulling, could you kindly confirm to me whether or not you make that request on behalf of your political group?\nAstrid Lulling\non behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Yes, Madam President, I never make anything not on behalf of my political group!\n(Laughter and applause)\nEdite Estrela\n(PT) Madam President, it does not make sense to refer this report, or this proposal, back to committee, because it was discussed with all the groups. It is presumably supported by a majority in this House. It was also discussed with the Commission and with the Council.\nNaturally, people have different opinions. We know that, regrettably, the Council under the Czech Presidency has adopted a very conservative attitude to the ", "8. Eurostars (\n- Before the vote on Amendments 15 and 30\nPaul R\u00fcbig\nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, I would like the word 'Luxembourg' to be included in this proposal.\n(The oral amendment was accepted)\n", "Progress of SIS II and VIS (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the progress of SIS II and VIS.\nJacques Barrot\nMadam President, I would not wish to try Parliament's patience, but all the same, I do need to clarify a number of things for the MEPs here present and for Parliament.\nWhen, a year and a half ago, I took on the portfolio of commissioner responsible for justice, freedom and security, I found on my desk two large-scale information technology projects aimed at equipping the Member States with modern and effective cooperation tools.\nThose two projects, SIS II and VIS, formed part of the same contract, signed in 2003, between the Commission and a consortium of information technology companies. Both of these projects are technologically complex. We need to interconnect a central system and national equipment with particularly demanding specifications, and make them interact.\nI have always tried to keep Parliament informed of these developments. Following the Justice and Home Affairs Councils in February and June 2009, I wrote to Mr Deprez, the chairman of Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, to inform him of how the work on SIS II was progressing. I sent you a copy of that correspondence, Mr Coelho, because you are the usual rapporteur for SIS-related issues, and you follow these issues closely.\nMotivated as I am by this spirit of openness, I should like today, once again, to give you as much information as possible. It is true that, like most major industrial projects, both SIS II and VIS are in danger of going over schedule and over budget. It is true that the situation is unsatisfactory as regards both SIS II and VIS.\nDespite the involvement of experts from the Commission and the Member States, SIS II continues to come up against various obstacles. VIS, for its part, has entered an important phase. The initial specifications made it difficult to perform the planned tests but it seems that, with the Me", "Green Paper on better ship dismantling (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Johannes Blokland, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Green Paper on better ship dismantling.\nJohannes Blokland\nrapporteur. - (NL) On various shores in South Asia enormous seagoing ships for scrapping are dismantled under conditions that are environmentally damaging and humanly degrading. Social standards do not apply here. In Bangladesh alone, 200 lives have been lost over the past few years as a result of work on the dismantling of ships.\nMany children are used to dismantle the ships because it is easy for them to get into small spaces. They are expected to remove toxic substances without any protection for themselves. The substances then end up in the environment, with disastrous consequences for the fishing and tourism industries. Regrettably, many ships from Europe also end up on the shores of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, for example, in this way. The high prices of steel, low wages, poor safety regulations and absence of environmental measures are evidently financially attractive.\nThe Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety clearly states that these practices are ethically unacceptable and that the humanly degrading and environmentally destructive conditions involved in the dismantling of ships must not be permitted to continue. The efforts of an individual Member State or of the European Union alone will not be sufficient to tackle this. Whatever we may do in the years ahead, a global solution to the problem of ship dismantling is still urgently needed. Unfortunately, it has to be said that not much has so far been achieved at global level.\nThis, indeed, is precisely the reason why the European Commission has published a green paper. The main objective that we wish to achieve is the protection of the environment and public health without simply displacing the problems to other countries. In view of ", "Draft general budget for 2008, modified by the Council (all sections) (signature) \nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, the next item is the signature of the Community budget for 2008 and I should like to thank the Council and the Commission sincerely for their effective cooperation. Prime Minister, President-in-Office, Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates, Mr Dur\u00e3o Barroso and Mrs Grybauskait\u0117, please accept our sincere thanks.\nWe shall now sign it and I would ask those concerned to approach the table: the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, the rapporteur, the Commissioner and the Presidents, too, if they so wish; they are warmly invited to do so.\n(The budget was signed)\n", "Order of business\nPresident\nThe final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 31 March 2011, pursuant to Rule 140 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed. The following amendments have been proposed:\nTuesday\nWith regard to the Fernandes report on estimates of Parliament's revenue and expenditure for 2012, the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group has requested that the vote be held over to the May part-session, and thus the request relates to holding the vote over. Mrs Andreasen will present the request. Please take the floor, Mrs Andreasen.\nMarta Andreasen\non behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, I rise to ask for the postponement of the vote on the Fernandes report. The reasons are straightforward and relate primarily to the paragraph of the report which covers the House of European History. The Committee on Budgets has been given conflicting, and I believe, misleading figures for this project. An example of this is the mounting annual running costs: they currently stand at EUR 13.5 million. This figure is in excess of what was originally quoted. When I had suggested that the cost would be EUR 10 million, a faceless parliamentary official accused me of lying in the press by saying my estimates were, I quote, 'excessive'. This is not the way a Member of this House should be treated.\nWhat is worst of all, Mr President, is the clear conflict of interests in having the chairman of the Budgets Committee sitting on the board of trustees of the House of European History, even if he is not remunerated. In no other parliament would such a clear conflict of interests be tolerated. It makes an absolute mockery of the committee process.\n(Applause)\nUntil these matters are cleared up, the vote on this report must be postponed.\nFrancesco Enrico Speroni\n(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think this postponement is appropriate. It is a case of four or five weeks, simply to examine a subject which, as we", "Restoration of reciprocity in the visa regime - solidarity with the unequal status of Czech citizens following the unilateral introduction of visas by Canada (written declaration): see Minutes\n", "Business registers for statistical purposes (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the recommendation for second reading by Mr Martin, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common framework for business registers for statistical purposes and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 2186/93 [07656/5/2007 - C6-0218/2007 -.\nHans-Peter Martin\nrapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, fellow Members, it is now so late that I can count just four of us here, including myself. However, one of the next speakers is a Quaestor who, I am sure, will use this opportunity to ensure that these forms of so-called debate, which in reality only take place for the purpose of the records, become more efficient and rational. Nevertheless, I am grateful, Commissioner, for your willingness to come here and subject yourself to this. To my mind, better governance, efficient and transparent governance, would be rather different from these debates at such an ungodly hour.\nAs to the matter in hand, we have come here to resume work on an issue which goes back some time. It is a key area, namely statistics. On the one hand, we have an entirely justified and necessary interest on the part of most persons involved in the political process, which is to inform themselves and to find out more quickly and in detail about linkages which may exist, especially in the corporate sector, and how they work, especially across borders: borders which, happily, we have already dismantled successfully between many countries throughout Europe.\nWe have thus taken up the Commission's proposal and taken it forward in response to this need, always being careful - through my numerous discussions at the time with my excellent colleague from the secretariat of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, from first reading onwards - not to create even more re", "19. Residue levels of pesticides in or on food and feed (implementing powers conferred on the Commission) (vote) \n- Report: Robert Sturdy\n- Before the vote\nSiim Kallas\nVice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission wishes to thank the European Parliament for its constructive support and welcomes the good compromise reached. As part of that compromise, the Commission has agreed to make the following statement:\n'The standard time limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny are laid down in Article 5a(3) and (4) of Decision 1999/468/EC. Derogation from paragraphs 3 and 4 may be provided in duly substantiated exceptional cases. The objective of curtailment of time limits under the regulatory procedure with scrutiny included in the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 on maximum residue levels of pesticides in or on food and feed as regards the implementing powers conferred on the Commission is to complete the process from application for a maximum residue level to adoption within less than one year. These adaptations are necessary to ensure consistency with the proposed one-year deadline for authorisation of plant protection products included in the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market.\nThe European Commission will examine the appropriateness of curtailment of time limits under the regulatory procedure with scrutiny after two years' experience with the authorisation procedure in the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market, taking into account experience gained in the application of these procedures in the European Parliament and the Council.'\n", "4. Adaptation of the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure to the Lisbon Treaty (\nBruno Gollnisch\n(FR) Mr President, my machine is not working, but that is not the main thing that I wanted to say.\nThis report, Mr President, included an amendment that has been withdrawn, Amendment 86. My point of order is based on Rule 24(2) of our Rules of Procedure. As I have had the honour of explaining to you on behalf of a number of my colleagues, this Rule provides for the non-attached Members to appoint one of their own as a delegate to the Conference of Presidents. Following the blocking by the administration, this obligation has not been met since July.\nHowever, it was envisaged, under this Amendment 86, that this provision would be changed in order to let you decide which of the representatives of the non-attached Members should sit in the Conference of Presidents. This, Mr President, is a real disgrace, and I choose my words carefully. It is seen as such by all our colleagues. It would seem that we are the only ones to have the appointment of our representative to the Conference of Presidents imposed on us.\nI hope, Mr President, that you will be intent on refusing this option afforded to you by the Socialist Group and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) to which you belong.\nPresident\nI understand what you are saying. Would the rapporteur like to say something about this? May I ask the rapporteur to comment?\nDavid Martin\nrapporteur. - Mr President, we do not have to spend a lot of time on this because the Non-Inscrits are not worth spending a lot of time on. We are not voting on this. If they bothered to turn up at the committees to which they are entitled to turn up, they would know that we are not voting on this today but we are going to vote on this in January. I will be sticking to my recommendation that you, Mr President, invite a Non-Inscrit to attend the Conference of Presidents.\n", "Food prices in Europe (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Batzeli, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the Food prices in Europe.\nKaterina Batzeli\nrapporteur. - (EL) Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the shadow rapporteurs in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the four jointly competent committees of the European Commission with which we collaborated in depth in order to produce this report.\nCommissioner, I should like to start by asking a very simple question: when consumers go to supermarkets to buy milk or yoghurt, why do they buy it? For the milk and the yoghurt or for the bottle and the tub? I put this question to you because the perception and attitude have been skilfully conveyed to consumers that they are buying a foodstuff where the industry that processes it, markets it and transports it is now more important than the agricultural product, the raw material itself. About 15 years ago, agricultural produce accounted for approximately 50% of the final value of the product; today it does not exceed 20%.\nFarmers, both arable and livestock, are now 'anonymous' persons for consumers. Their bargaining power, on the question not only of the final price but also of the preservation of the qualitative and nutritional elements in the final product, lags behind the role which they should have.\nWe are not attempting to draw dividing lines, to classify the productive sectors in the supply chain, the farmers, manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers as 'the good', 'the bad' and 'the ugly', because I do not believe that we are living in a 'Wild West' society and economy; I believe that we are living in an economy based on the regulations of the internal market of the European Union, a market which provides opportunity for growth and competitiveness when it operates transparently, but which ousts or eliminates producers and economic activities when unfair and opaque functions p", "European integration process of Montenegro (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on the European integration process of Montenegro.\nEnik\u0151 Gy\u0151ri\nMadam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you will be voting on the resolution on the European integration process of Montenegro tomorrow. I consider the commitment of the European Parliament to preserve the openness of the European Union very commendable. At the same time, you will also have an important role in winning over the general public of the Member States to the cause of enlargement, of enlargement based on conditionality. The resolution you will be adopting tomorrow also confirms the realisation of this responsibility.\nLet me tell you that there is utmost commitment on the part of the Council as well. In line with the renewed enlargement consensus approved by the European Council, the Council confirmed in its conclusions of 14 December 2010 that the EU firmly supports the continuation of the enlargement process in the Western Balkans countries on the basis of the principles and conclusions adopted.\nThe Hungarian Presidency of the European Council is also deeply committed to this objective. I would like to thank you for the excellent work you have done, and for contributing through this resolution to the consolidation of Montenegro's achievements, for which there is a great need throughout the accession process.\nWe have confirmed Montenegro's European perspective on several occasions. The stability of the country and its orientation towards Europe, which is supported by all political parties as well as the majority of the citizens, and the high degree of consensus between the various ethnic groups, are all features which make Montenegro a stabilising factor in the Western Balkans region.\nLet us not forget that Montenegro achieved visa liberalisation, the conclusion of the stabilisation and association agreement, and obtained candidate country status within 12 months.

Movement of persons with a long-stay visa (\nBefore the vote:\nCarlos Coelho\nMr President, this is a short statement to remind you that the Community Visa Code enters into force on 5 April - that is, next month - and, therefore, it is essential that this new regulation enters into force before that date.\nIn the absence of the Council, let the record reflect that these are the wishes of Parliament if, as I hope, it will make the implementation of my report possible.\nPresident\nThe absence of the Council is noted and is unfortunate.\n", "22. Evaluation mechanism to monitor the application of the Schengen acquis (\nKarel De Gucht\nMr President, yesterday, my colleague, the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Barrot, stressed that the aim of the proposals is to communitise the evaluation mechanism and to make it more effective, while maintaining mutual confidence among the Member States.\nThe Commission is convinced that Parliament should be involved in the Schengen evaluation, which is not the case at present. The citizens must have access to the results of these evaluations.\nHowever, in accordance with the treaties in force, it is not possible to involve Parliament by way of codecision. The Commission therefore stands by its proposals on the basis of the treaties in force.\nNevertheless, once the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force, the matter will be reopened and the Commission will decide, when the time comes, what it considers to be the most appropriate legal basis for the proposed mechanism, and will involve the European Parliament as fully as possible.\nThe Commission could therefore submit amended or new proposals depending on the situation.\nCarlos Coelho\nI appreciate the clarifications given by the European Commission, but would like to remind the House that, as was made clear during the debate, although the Legal Service of the European Parliament recognised the legitimacy of the legal basis of the Commission's initiative, it also said that, based on the Treaty in force, the European Commission could have taken the same initiative based on a legal formula according the European Parliament the power of codecision.\nAs this was not the case, I propose that the initiative should be returned to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs so that the Commission can rethink its initiative. Then, within the term set out in Rule 56 of our Rules of Procedure, we in Parliament can expect to receive an initiative from the Commission that respects codecision and gives this European Parliament t", "Formal sitting - Hungary\nPresident\nMr President of the Republic of Hungary, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honour to welcome you to the plenum of the European Parliament, President S\u00f3lyom.\nPresident S\u00f3lyom is a distinguished lawyer who has always demonstrated his determination to protect the law, political freedom and human dignity. He was one of the first five judges whose appointments were agreed at the national Round Table held in Hungary in 1989, when that country and others found their freedom.\nAs President of the Constitutional Court, President S\u00f3lyom had a huge influence on the decisions that strengthened the young Hungarian democracy and institutions.\nAs the Third President of the Republic of Hungary, Mr S\u00f3lyom has increased the weight and prestige of his country.\nHe is a defender of social and environmental rights. He commanded respect during the first year of his term in office, carrying out his duties with caution, but acting firmly when necessary.\nHe is also a committed environmentalist. This has led him to create a European Group of Green Presidents, that is to say, of heads of state concerned about environmental problems, an original and creative initiative.\n(Applause)\nYou can imagine which group the Members applauding you belong to.\nFifty years ago, the uprising of the Hungarian people confirmed the strength of popular support for democratic principles and their will to dictate their own national destiny. We are currently remembering and celebrating a series of milestones.\nIt all began in 1989, when his country proclaimed its independence and in 1990, when the Hungarian Parliament declared 23 October a Hungarian national holiday, demonstrating that the legacy of the 1956 Revolution is still alive amongst us.\nAt its plenary sitting yesterday, the European Parliament commemorated the Hungarian Revolution of 1956; this Thursday we shall approve a resolution relating to it. Furthermore, this afternoon the European Parliament will mark this commemorative d", "One-minute speeches on matters of political importance\nPresident\nThe next item is the one-minute speeches.\nIuliu Winkler\n(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President. The Regional Development and Cohesion Funds are very important for the new Member States, since the differences between regions are very significant for them. My country, Romania, can apply for more than EUR 20 billion for regional development by 2013. One year after our accession, experience shows an improvement in drawing on funds dedicated to regional development, but we are still far from accomplishing what we want. It is crucial for the regions of Romania that they increase their ability to draw on the Funds, by using them effectively and accounting for them systematically.\nRomania needs tools for this, such as, for example, an effective and increasingly decentralised system of public administration institutions, and a new division into areas of economic development, since the current regions are not fit for purpose, nor are they effective, so new regions need to be created from the bottom up according to appropriate social agreements, and which would be led by elected regional governments. The new division of Romania into areas of economic development cannot be delayed. Thank you very much.\nMarusya Ivanova Lyubcheva\n(BG) I would like to draw your attention to some problems related to disaster and accidents at sea. These are usually discussed when they occur, and then time quickly sweeps tragedies away from memory. Accidents at sea, however, are part of the common maritime policy. We must get ready for them just like we get ready to implement a transfer.\nThe Bulgarian ship Vanessa was shipwrecked recently in the Sea of Azov. During the past several months there were a number of accidents in the Bay of Kerch in bad weather. Sailors died, others went missing, there were damages worth millions of euro. The Sea of Azov and the Black Sea were polluted with oil.

It has often been the avant-garde in European integration. It is truly remarkable that a policy which does not very often hit the front pages has nevertheless managed to play a pioneering role in opening new paths both for the economic development and the integration of the Community.\nToday the role of customs remains important, difficult and, regrettably, not as highly valued by the public as it should be. However, the correct work of customs forms the basis for the success of our single market and the free movement of goods, persons, capital and services. Customs action touches the very core of Community work and impacts on the daily life of our citizens, often without people realising it.\nIn order to raise our citizens' awareness about the crucial role of customs, I have launched an EU-wide communication campaign on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Customs Union. Member States' customs authorities have backed this idea.\nLast week I visited three main points of entry for goods at the EU's external borders - the Port of Rotterdam, Frankfurt Airport and the R\u00f6szke crossing point at the Hungarian-Serbian border - with a view to highlighting the everyday work and the high motivation of our customs officials. This is the subject of a news package now available to the media in orde", "22. The EU as a global actor: its role in multilateral organisations (\nBefore the vote:\nGerard Batten\nMr President, on a point of order, on the next report, which is the Mu\u00f1iz De Urquiza report, I am applying to speak under Rule 167 on roll-call votes. Going back to the Arsenis report, on Amendment 25, one of my colleagues over there requested a roll-call vote because he felt it was important. You granted it to him.\nThere is no provision for this in the Rules of Procedure and you did not ask Parliament for approval. We have all enjoyed the unorthodox powers that you have granted yourself today, so I would like to ask for the same provision. Because this is important to me personally, I should like you to grant me a roll-call vote on every amendment on this report under the same Rule whereby you granted it to the gentleman over there.\nPresident\nColleagues, under our rules and our practice, granting roll-call votes or not is in the hands of the President every time. The President may grant a roll-call vote if he feels it does not disrupt the session or, for example, if there are many requests, he may ask the House. There is no particular rule one way or another. I just want to make this clear to everyone so that we do not set any precedent here that was not intended to be set.\nUnder the circumstances, nevertheless, I have no objection to granting the request in this particular case, but I would very much like to ask Members not to abuse this potential because, if they do, then the President will ask the House every time and there will be contentiousness where there should be none. If you insist on your request, I will take every one of these as a roll-call vote.\nEnd of voting time\n", "United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities - UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities - Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate:\non the Council statement on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities;\non the report by Mrs Jeleva, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision concerning the conclusion, by the European Community, of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities - C6-0116/2009 -;\non the report by Mrs Jeleva, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision concerning the conclusion, by the European Community, of the Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities - C6-0117/2009 -.\nPetr Ne\u010das\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur Rumiana Jeleva for the two excellent reports she has produced. I expect my comments on the reports and their conclusions will be relatively brief.\nOn 11 June 2007, at the first informal meeting of ministers on questions of disability, the Council adopted a clear position supporting the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. At this meeting the Council approved the UN Convention as a basic step concerning support, protection and adequate implementation of human rights and basic freedoms for all persons with disabilities. At the same time the ministers made a commitment to a further development of relevant policies with the aim of securing a full implementation of the Convention. They called on the Commission to ensure that the new priorities of the European Action Plan in the area of disability contribute to the effective implementation of the UN Convention.\nIn its resolution concer", "Announcements by the President\nPresident\nIn opening the last session of the European Parliament in 2009, I would firstly like to offer you all - all fellow Members - my sincere wishes for the approaching Christmas season, for the Chanukah festival, which has already begun, and for the coming new year. On behalf of all Members of the European Parliament, I would like to express similar sincere wishes to the administration, to all those who work directly with Parliament and assist us in our work.\nI would also like to mention the attack on the Prime Minister of Italy, Silvio Berlusconi. The attack deserves our unequivocal condemnation. Political discussion must not be conducted in such a fashion. Yesterday's incident should never have taken place. We hope Mr Berlusconi will be able to leave hospital soon and we wish him a quick return to health.\nWith your permission, I would also like to mention an anniversary which is important to me personally. Yesterday, it was 28 years since the imposition of martial law in Poland by the then Communist authorities. As a result, almost 100 people lost their lives, including the nine miners who were shot during the strike at the Wujek Mine. Many thousands of democratic opposition activists were interned, and others were even imprisoned. This was intended to break up and destroy the Solidarity trade union. I refer to these events because I would like to draw attention to how greatly Europe has changed in the past two or three decades, but also to how we ought to strive for peace and human rights in our continent and throughout the world.\nI would also like to take the opportunity to remind you that on Wednesday at 12.00, a ceremony will be held to present the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. This year, the prize has been awarded to Lyudmila Alexeyeva, Sergei Kovalev and Oleg Orlov, who represent the Russian human rights defence organisation Memorial.

I have been prevented from being present in this Chamber for the past two days due to the actions of racist, violent extremists who, as a mob of around 40 or so, targeted my family home whilst we were present and carried out a spree of violent activity in my original home town. Were it not for the swift action of Lancashire police in carrying out arrests and bringing charges, and their provision of security for my family, I would not be able to be present here now.\nToday, I send a clear message to all violent extremists that we will not cower in the face of their intimidation and violence. Our vision for our countries and this Union is very different to their divisiveness and hate. Collectively we will face them.\n(Applause)\nPresident\nMr Karim, you have the full support of this House.\n", "Security situation in the Sahel region (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on an oral question to the Vice-President of the Commission, the Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, by Arnaud Danjean, Ioannis Kasoulides, Elmar Brok, Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Salafranca S\u00e1nchez-Neyra, Michael Gahler, Krzysztof Lisek and Andrey Kovatchev, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), concerning the security situation in the Sahel region - B7-0808/2010).\nArnaud Danjean\nMr President, Baroness Ashton, the subject we are dealing with today is one that we ought to have begun looking at many months ago, given that the security situation in the Sahel region has been steadily deteriorating for over three years now. Furthermore, we are dealing with the subject in a week in which we in France have buried two innocent young victims of Islamic terrorism, who were killed on the Niger-Mali border a few weeks ago.\nAside from the intense feelings that these crimes arouse, we need to recognise the real threats concentrated in this region on Europe's doorstep, as the threat is not only from terrorism, even though the kidnappings and murders are the most dramatic manifestation of the deteriorating situation in Mauritania, Mali and Niger. Criminal networks are rife. Trafficking in drugs, arms and human beings is threatening the stability of these countries, but also that of our own continent. For make no mistake, in the same way that the majority of the victims of the terrorist acts in this region are European citizens, Europe is also the destination for this trafficking.\nIn the face of this extremely worrying situation, the European Union should put in place an integrated, comprehensive strategy to combine its development and security policies. This is absolutely vital. There are initiatives already in place of course, via the tenth European Development Fund (EDF) in particular, and almost EUR 2 billion have been set aside for these", "Deposit-guarantee schemes (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Christian Ehler, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on deposit-guarantee schemes.\nChristian Ehler\nrapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me pleasure to be able to present a report to you today that was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Before the vote in committee, the future of deposit-guarantee schemes was the subject of intense debate, particularly in the light of specific regional problems at the present time and of the recent crisis in the US property market.\nAt the end of 2006 the Commission presented a communication reviewing the 1994 Directive on deposit-guarantee schemes. Before drafting the communication, the Commission conducted a consultation process. On the basis of the empirical findings that emerged, we can conclude that the aims of the directive have essentially been achieved and that there is no need for any legislative intervention at the present time.\nThe increasingly cross-border nature of financial market structures in Europe, however, requires us to focus more sharply on the question of cooperation between the diverse deposit-guarantee schemes in Europe. In its communication, the Commission identified the areas in which self-regulation measures or different treatment of the legal bases could bring about further improvements in the interests of consumers.\nThis approach should, in our view, be pursued further. We believe that the dynamic discussion process involving the Commission, the Member States and the EFDI, the European Forum of Deposit Insurers, has a very useful role to play in enabling us to adapt as quickly as possible to changing circumstances.\nThe Nordea problem does not warrant calling for an expensive new amendment of the directive at the present moment. I am therefore grateful to the Commission for making it crystal-clear that the Nordea problem, which ", "\n(1) \nLudford (ELDR ).\n\u00a0\u00a0  Mr President, on a point of order. I wanted to raise this point yesterday, but you did not authorise me to intervene.\nI want to draw your attention and that of Parliament to the fact that on 29 April the Council signed two legislative acts without having had the opinion of the European Parliament, the pretext being that it had fixed a deadline which we had not respected.\nI want to point out that the same pre-emptive deadline has been fixed for today on the draft agreement with the United States on the air passenger data transfers \u2013 the so-called PNR agreement. To avoid the will of Parliament being negated, I request that you send a formal request to the Presidents of the Council and the Commission that they should abstain from taking any decisions before the Court has given its judgment, especially during this electoral period. This would be the minimum that we could expect in the framework of loyal cooperation between the institutions.\nThe delay should not be too long because the Court has already announced a deadline of 6 June for the parties to present their arguments and it seems that the Court is speeding up its proceedings and may well reach a judgment before the summer. In those circumstances, it does not seem too much to ask that the Council and the Commission should respect both our institution and the Court of Justice, and not undermine the rule of law, given that the Court is willing to progress speedily. I fear these two precedents on 29 April. I ask you to invite them formally to abstain from signing the agreement.\nBoogerd-Quaak (ELDR ),\n\u00a0\u00a0 .  Mr President, I share Mrs Ludford's view. I will not repeat what she said. I only want to draw your attention to the fact that yesterday, I wrote a letter to Mr Gargani, the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, to remind him of the debate held in that committee on 6 April, in which we decided to set the Court procedure in motion. In that debate, however, an", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 28 January 1999.\n\nStatement by the President\nPresident\nI should like to inform the House that I have addressed a telegram to the Jordanian royal family and to the President of the Jordanian Parliament, expressing the European Parliament's condolences on the death of King Hussein.\n\nApproval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of the sitting of Friday, 28 January 1999 have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nChichester\nMr President, on a point of order. I wrote to you last week drawing your attention to a letter which was addressed to you, dated 28 October, from President Santer of the Commission. Although it was addressed to you, the letter was in fact in response to a letter from me. I wrote to President Santer on 28 October; his reply, addressed to you, came on 7 January.\nI rise not about the substance of the letter but to ask whether it is normal practice for the Commission to respond to letters from Members in this way and whether it is acceptable that there should be a ten-week delay. Perhaps I should add that the correspondence was to do with matters that were very much under debate during the last part-session. I would ask for your view of the conduct of the Commission in this regard.\n\nPresident.\nMr Chichester, as you will appreciate, this is a question that only the Commission can answer, especially as regards the delay. Perhaps you could put the question to the Commission in the normal way. In any case, when I meet President Santer, which happens very often now, I will raise the question with him.\n\nMalangr\u00e9\nMr President, my name is not on the attendance register in the Minutes. As there is proof of my attendance in the form of various comments and in the roll-call votes, I would ask you to add my name to the register.\n\nPresident\nThank you, Mr Malangr\u00e9.

Stepping-stone Agreement towards an Economic Partnership Agreement between the EC and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (\n- Before the vote:\nErika Mann\nrapporteur. - Madam President, I will be very brief. I would just like to thank my colleagues and to recommend a positive vote in the assent procedure. However, I would love to have Commissioner Ashton's confirmation again on the points we raised during our debate on Monday - specifically, Commissioner, when you committed yourself to giving the same preferences to C\u00f4te d'Ivoire that you had already accepted for SADC. You are nodding - perfect! Thank you so much.\nPresident\n- We have agreement, so we will continue with the vote.\n", "2. Democratic Republic of Congo: clashes in the eastern border areas\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the Democratic Republic of Congo: clashes in the eastern border areas.\nRenate Weber\nauthor. - Mr President, the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is profoundly traumatising for Congolese society.\nAmongst other atrocities, rape has been used for many years as a weapon of war and tens of thousands of women and girls are suffering. Our empathy is not enough. Without any doubt, there is an ongoing genocide against women in Congo, and we can no longer afford to turn a blind eye to this dreadful situation. Words are not enough to describe the horrors these women have to endure. Undoubtedly, the clashes of the rebels in the eastern provinces will bring more and more violence, including sexual violence.\nHow many women and girls have to die, be gang-raped, butchered, enslaved, contaminated with HIV, rejected by their communities, until we decide at am international level to engage seriously and with a long-term view on this subject? There should be no tolerance for the sexual violence against girls and women. The impunity of the perpetrators must come to an end and the rule of law has to be restored in the eastern provinces of the DRC.\nWe all have to acknowledge that this situation demands a multifaceted approach. Peace needs to be achieved, the rule of law established and society saved from the poverty trap in the eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo. This implies that the exploitation of Congolese natural resources must follow the rule of law as well.\nGiovanna Corda\nauthor. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, please accept the apologies of my colleague, Mr Hutchinson, who could not be with us today.\n5 400 000 people - that is the number of victims of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo since 1998. Every day, 1 500 people die. These people are women who do not survive the m", "Lisbon Strategy - Broad Economic Policy Guidelines for 2008-2010 (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the Council and Commission statements on the Lisbon Strategy, followed by the report by Mrs Starkevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Integrated Guidelines for Growth and Jobs (Part: broad guidelines for the economic policies of the Member States and the Community): Launching the new cycle (2008-2010)\n\u017diga Turk\nPresident-in-Office. - (SL) I am very pleased to be taking part in this session, in which the European Parliament is debating the start of the next phase of the Lisbon strategy for growth and employment.\nThe signing of the Treaty of Lisbon concludes an era in which we were greatly occupied with our own internal and sometimes political shape. Europe is now considerably better equipped to open itself up to the world, and the Lisbon strategy provides the tools for Europe to help in the shaping of world trends as well. The present moment is characterised by at least four of these trends.\nWhen Europe launched the Lisbon strategy in 2000, globalisation was mainly understood to be a competition between Europe, the USA and Japan. Since then, new and important players have entered the world stage and are giving us cause to reflect anew on the contribution that Europe can make to this global world and where its true competitive advantages lie.\nThe communications revolution is happening before our very eyes, with the Internet and the World Wide Web. Creativity and innovation are no longer restricted to rigid institutional schemes. Only once in the past have we witnessed a revolution in mass communication; that was 500 years ago when cheap paper and print came along, forming the foundation of European supremacy.\nWe are on the threshold of a third industrial revolution, the consequence of which will be significantly reduced dependence on fossil fuels and transition to a low-carbon economy. In May 2007, Parliamen", "2. Azerbaijan: freedom of expression (vote) \nLaima Liucija Andrikien\u0117\non behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, on behalf of the PPE Group, I propose the following oral amendment to paragraph 7: the words 'deplores the Azerbaijani authorities' decision not' should be replaced with the words 'urges the Azerbaijani authorities'. The text should read as follows: 'Urges the Azerbaijani authorities to renew the FM radio licences of a number of international broadcasters...' and so on.\n", "\n(1) \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is the continuation of the debate on the statement by the President-designate of the Commission. \nNassauer (PPE-DE ).\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this legislative period, our Parliament has to take on a new role, one that is also prefigured in the draft of the constitutional treaty. It is generally said that this treaty will give the House new rights; on closer examination, it appears that this House gains a role for itself only when it can rely on an absolute majority of its Members in doing its job. That is particularly the case when it is engaged in making laws. Only if Parliament acts with an absolute majority does it play its part in the triangle of power formed by it, the Commission and the Council. Such, it is becoming apparent, is the constitutional reality in this House, and there are political conclusions to which we must come as a result.\nIn the past, it was all too often the case that Parliament was ground down between the Council and the Commission, for lack of any solid majority, and because either the Council or the Commission could play Parliament off against the other. For that reason, we are convinced that we in this House must, from now on, make the effort to take up a position and also accept our responsibilities. That presupposes political cooperation in this House. Looking at the relative strengths of our political groups, it is inevitable that even the two big ones will have to consider whether they can cooperate with each other, and, if so, in which areas. The fact is that, numerically speaking, that is the only way in which a majority in this House will come into being, and that is why we are presented with the unaccustomed sight of parties that, in their domestic, indigenous, national reality are as a rule the complete natural antithesis of each other \u2013 Socialists on the one hand, Christian Democrats and Conservatives on the other \u2013 attempting in this House to work together from time to time", "Situation in Burma (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Burma.\nJanez Lenar\u010di\u010d\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (SL) The European Union is closely following the situation in Burma, or Myanmar. We are actively supporting efforts, made primarily by the United Nations, to accelerate the transition to democracy, reconciliation and the country's development. We are also consulting our Asian partners about all these issues. The special envoy, Mr Fassino, reported to the European Parliament on the situation in Burma/Myanmar. He also informed Parliament about the alignments taking place with Burma's neighbours and other ASEAN members.\nAs we know, the United Nations Special Envoy, Mr Gambari, visited the country at the beginning of March. I must stress our disappointment that his visit did not have any obvious results. Most of all, we had the impression that the Burmese authorities were not prepared to cooperate with the international community. The European Union would like to see the authorities accept Mr Gambari's proposals for a further political process. The entire international community agrees with these proposals, which are not too far-reaching.\nThe EU and Mr Gambari are pointing to similar problems. In addition, the EU regularly sends key political communications to Burma/Myanmar. One of those key communications is the recent European Parliament resolution regarding the situation in that country. Our central joint message is principally that national reconciliation, stability and prosperity will only be possible through a credible and inclusive process of democratisation. This is why the European Union is keenly following the response of the opposition to the coming referendum on the constitution.\nWe are calling on the authorities to allow an unimpeded and open debate about the constitution before the referendum, to stop persecuting political activists and to repeal laws that limit the freedom ", "Towards a new culture of urban mobility (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Reinhard Rack, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on 'Towards a new culture of urban mobility'.\nReinhard Rack\nrapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, last autumn the Commission presented a Green Paper entitled 'Towards a new culture of urban mobility' and it plans to submit an action plan containing specific measures in a few months' time.\nThe European Parliament felt it had a duty and responsibility as co-legislator for future measures and as a budgetary power to state its position on this Green Paper in good time. We approached the subject confidently and carefully: confidently in the sense that we want to say where the European Parliament believes this road should take us, and carefully because we do not want to question the Commission's right of initiative but will await its detailed proposals.\nThere was broad consensus on this subject during the discussions in the Committee on Transport. I want briefly to address a few important questions.\nA key theme that rightly concerned many colleagues was subsidiarity. They asked who should be a player in this regard and whether it was a matter for Europe in the first place and felt that perhaps we should not get too carried in making decisions, and so forth.\nOur answer would be this: we are assuming that the presentation of this Green Paper followed by the action plan will not affect the existing delineation of areas of responsibility in Europe but that all the competent players, the European Union, the Member States and the regional and local authorities, will make use of their competences and, crucially, coordinate them sensibly among themselves. In that respect, we would like to see an integrated overall concept and to see urban decisions on what is in fact right and important for the individual municipalities.\nAnother issue is to ensure that transport matches people's needs. We should not mislead European citizens ", "Situation in Egypt (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the situation in Egypt.\nCommissioner F\u00fcle will take the floor on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.\n\u0160tefan F\u00fcle\nMember of the Commission. - Madam President, it is my pleasure to be here with you today. As you are certainly aware, the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission is visiting the southern Mediterranean at the moment and has asked me to address you on her behalf on the events in Egypt.\nThe political reality of Egypt changed spectacularly last Friday when President Mubarak stepped down after 30 years in office. His departure has opened the way to the possible transformation of Egypt. Let me repeat this in front of this House: the European Union salutes the courage of the Egyptian people who have pursued their struggle for democratic change peacefully and with dignity.\nA great responsibility now rests on the shoulders of the Supreme Military Council to guide Egypt towards the democratic future for which its people have striven. We have taken good note of the commitments to revise the Constitution, to hold parliamentary and presidential elections, to honour international treaties and obligations and to limit military rule to six months.\nThere are already reports on the first steps taken. The proposal for a constitutional amendment should be delivered within ten days and submitted to popular vote within two months. We will closely watch the steps that are taken and we hope they will pave the way towards democratic, free and fair elections later in the year.\nThe European Union responded to the events in Egypt as soon as the public protests escalated. We repeatedly called on the Egyptian authorities to ensure an immediate transition and to respond to the democratic ambitions of th", "\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 27 October 2005. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 I would like now to make a statement at the opening of this plenary sitting on the attacks in Amman.\nLadies and gentlemen, as you know, on 9 November, the terrorists struck again, demonstrating their full horrific capabilities, this time in Jordan.\nOn behalf of all of us \u2013 on behalf of the European Parliament \u2013 I immediately expressed the emotion we felt as a result of this attack to the Jordanian authorities and I asked them to communicate our condolences to the families of the victims.\nWe will have the opportunity to debate the phenomenon of terrorism and the most effective way to tackle it at the meetings that we will hold on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the Barcelona Declaration.\nTerrorism today is a problem that not only affects Europe. Terrorist attacks also take place in Casablanca and in Jordan. It therefore threatens both flanks of the Mediterranean and they must tackle it in a joint fashion.\nThis issue will certainly be on the agenda and will figure in the debates that we will hold in Rabat on 20 and 21 November, at the extraordinary meeting of the APEM, and also in Barcelona, on the 27th and 28th, at the Summit of Heads of State or Government.\nAt this point, however, I believe that we must make it very clear that, for us, these barbarous acts demonstrate the extent to which the attacks are not aimed at people with different religions or skin colours; this has nothing to do with the lethal strategy of the terrorists. It is urgent that Europe should cooperate in order to make progress with the \u2018alliance of civilisations\u2019, that will enable us to avoid the \u2018clash of civilisations\u2019.\nFor all of these reasons, I would ask you to stand and observe a minute\u2019s silence in memory of the victims of the attacks in Amman.\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The final version of the draft agenda for the present part-session and the November II part-session a", "Other business\nStavros Lambrinidis\nAs some of you may know, four days ago I was appointed to become the new Foreign Minister of Greece.\n(Applause)\nThank you.

Everyone said 'Good luck'.\n(Laughter and applause)\nI just wanted to say a brief goodbye. I will miss this Parliament tremendously. I will miss all the friends I have made here tremendously. I do not think there is a better place in Europe for the passion and the compassion that this Parliament can bring to bear. I am deeply grateful and, because I do not want my last goodbye to be a goodbye in English and because I do not want you to forget the Greek that you have learned in the past year and a half, I will tell you what I suggest we do.

That desire is that the wonderful country that you serve as Foreign Minister should overcome its serious crisis as quickly as possible with our help. We need Greece. We stand shou", "1. Fiji\nPresident\nThe next item on the agenda is the debate on the situation in Fiji.\nJustas Vincas Paleckis \nauthor. - (LT) The situation in Fiji is very tense after yet another coup d'\u00e9tat. I believe that the European Parliament should react firmly. Four revolutions over twenty years - that is really too many, and it promises nothing good for the people or the country. This frightens off overseas investment, sharply reduces the flow of tourists, and stops financial aid.\nThe European Union allotted large sums of money to raise the educational standard and political sophistication of all ethnic groups, but unfortunately it has not been enough. Thus far, the revolution has not claimed human victims. The legal government welcomes acts of peaceful resistance. Its position is supported by influential church representatives and the Great Council of Chiefs. The situation is controlled by the army and censorship has been introduced. The arrests and questioning of opposition representatives indicate that the situation may still become more acute.\nThe EU and our allies in this region should give a clear signal that the use of force will not be tolerated and that avoiding bloodshed is essential.\nI invite my colleagues to condemn the use of force in Fiji, not to recognise the usurpers of power, and to support the opposition's invitation to the people of the country to oppose the revolution through peaceful demonstrations. It is important to organise democratic elections in Fiji that meet the international standards as soon as possible, which are based on an equality principle between people despite their ethnic origin, and return to efforts of observing principles of legal superiority and democracy.\nNirj Deva \nauthor. - Mr President, yet again we are confronted with a coup d'\u00e9tat in Fiji. Fiji has now suffered four coups d'\u00e9tat in the last ten years and the latest one is based on the most unbelievable logic of Commander Bainimarama, who says that he took action to have a coup ", "The factors favouring support for terrorism and the recruitment of terrorists (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by G\u00e9rard Deprez, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the factors favouring support for terrorism and the recruitment of terrorists.\nG\u00e9rard Deprez\nrapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, the report that I have the honour of presenting to you today on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has its beginnings in a proposal that was tabled at the end of 2005 by our colleague Mr Duquesne, to whom I now pay tribute.\nI also wish to point out that the bulk of the work relating to this report was carried out by our colleague Mr Mayor Oreja, who for reasons that I cannot comment on here decided to withdraw his name following the vote that was held in committee.\nAs regards the content of the report that has been presented to Parliament, I believe that it can be summarised by structuring the numerous elements it contains around four main themes.\nTheme one is the gravity and permanence of the threat. It is an undeniable fact that terrorism in general, and Jihadist terrorism in particular, is now one of the most serious threats to the security of the citizens of the European Union. The bloody attacks on Madrid in 2004 and on London in 2005, and let us also not forget all the other attempts that have been foiled since then, all testify to the permanent and serious nature of this threat. From this it follows - and the report is fairly emphatic on this point - that the fight against terrorism must remain one of the priorities of the European Union and its Member States.\nHowever, and this is the report's second theme, this determined fight against terrorism has to be waged in a certain way.

Joint Declaration on practical arrangements for the codecision procedure (vote) \n- Report: Leinen\n- Before the vote:\nJo Leinen \nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the codecision procedure is the most important instrument available to this House, and the new agreement with the Council and the Commission makes it considerably more transparent and a good deal more efficient. On some points of detail, we and the Council of Ministers see eye to eye.\nI want to take this opportunity to extend warm thanks to Mrs Roth-Behrendt, Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca and Mr Trakatellis, who spent over a year negotiating with the Council and the Commission, and also to Mr Daul, who watched over the whole business. This new agreement, then, brings us a good way forward where the codecision procedure is concerned.\n", "Preparation of the Employment Summit - European Globalisation Adjustment Fund - Renewed Social Agenda - Active inclusion of people excluded from the labour market (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on:\nthe Council and Commission statements on the Preparation of the Employment Summit,\nthe report by Gabriele Stauner, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund - C6-0518/2008 -,\nthe report by Jos\u00e9 Albino Silva Peneda, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Renewed Social Agenda, and\nthe report by Jean Lambert, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the active inclusion of persons excluded from the labour market.\nAlexandr Vondra\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - Madam President, we are all aware that we are continuing to suffer from one of the most severe financial and economic crises for many years. The Union and the Member States have taken a wide range of measures both to try to mitigate the effects of this crisis, and also to address some of its root causes, while also taking into account the pressing need to better prepare ourselves for the future in order to face the challenges of the global economy.\nWe are also aware that the current difficulties are not simply about figures on balance sheets, or amending economic forecasts. They have a real impact on people: on their livelihoods, on their families, and on their standards of living. Most directly affected are those who have already lost their jobs as a result, or the many more who risk losing their jobs over the months to come.\nThe Spring European Council agreed that an Employment Summit should be held in order to allow for an exchange of experiences on the extent to which the recovery measures taken have succeeded in supporting employment and creating new jobs and more jobs. The Summit will take place in Prague this Thursday.\nThe mandate given to the Presidency was clear. We", "1. The case of Gilad Shalit\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate about cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (Rule 122 of the Rules of Procedure), initially the case of Gilad Shalit (four motions for resolutions).\nBastiaan Belder  \nauthor. - (NL) Mr President, at around 8 o'clock this morning, here in Parliament, I visited the website dedicated to Gilad Shalit and a painful fact immediately caught my eye: for 1355 days, 3 hours, 12 minutes and 37 seconds, Gilad, who has been abducted, has been denied any contact with his father, mother, brother and sister. However, on the same website I also came across a passage from the Book of Jeremiah: 'So there is hope for your descendants, declares the Lord. Your children will return to their own land'. Noam Shalit, who is with us here today, is placing his hope and confidence in you, as well as in the God of Israel, to obtain the release of his precious son.\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating the case of Gilad Shalit. During a special meeting with the Israeli delegation yesterday afternoon, I already assured Noam Shalit that his cause - the release of Gilad Shalit - is our cause, too. Let this debate and this resolution be clear signs of that, which obviously call for follow-up by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs. Yesterday morning, I spoke to Baroness Ashton personally about this. The case of Shalit is our cause, a European cause.\nLadies and gentlemen, please remain loyal to this cause in the coming period as well. I am counting on you. Let Europe make a difference in the Middle East. Together with Noam Shalit and his family, we are looking forward to the fulfilment of the rabbinic prayer for Shalit, psalm 126, verse 1: 'When the Lord brought back the captives to Zion, we were like men who dreamed'.\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Ries\nMr President, Commissioner, Gilad Shalit was 19 years old when he was kidnapped in a Hamas attack near Gaza.

A very warm welcome to the European Parliament.\n(Applause)\n", "Undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) (recast) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Wolf Klinz, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) (recast) - C6-0287/2008 -.\nWolf Klinz\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in July 2008 the European Commission presented its proposal for a revision of the existing Directive on Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS), thus providing the basis for what we are debating today. We needed to stick to an extremely ambitious timetable if we wanted to ensure that we could actually succeed in revising the UCITS Directive, which has been in place since 1985 in its initial form, by the end of this parliamentary term.\nThe clear aim of these reforms was to improve the competitiveness of the European fund industry, to enable it to reduce its costs, to develop and make use of economies of scale, to ensure that all fund providers do indeed have access to all markets in the European Union, and to achieve all of this without reducing protection for investors: on the contrary, we wanted to improve protection for investors. In other words, we had a very ambitious programme, and I have to say that I really do appreciate the fact that, in cooperation with all the institutions involved, we have managed to conclude this project within such a short period.\nInvestment funds provide small investors with the option of investing small sums of capital in a diversified, professionally managed portfolio. In the past, European UCITS have already proven to be a great success story. Collective investments in transferable securities are not only sold in Europe, but are also, to a not inconsiderable extent, exported to r", "Impact of aviation security measures and body scanners on human rights, privacy, personal dignity and data protection (debate)\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the impact of aviation security measures and body scanners on human rights, privacy, personal dignity and data protection, by Philip Bradbourn and Marco Cappato, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs - B6-0478/2008).\nPhilip Bradbourn\nauthor. - Mr President, I would like to focus the House's attention on the recent announcement by the Commission to apply whole-body imaging technology to Europe's airports by 2010.\nHere I would like the Commission to clarify and justify many points which have been raised in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. The most important is why this step is seen merely as a technical change to the existing aviation security regulation and, thus, why parliamentary scrutiny of fundamental issues of personal privacy and dignity are being bypassed.\nThis technology has the potential - and, I stress, the potential - to force air passengers to undergo what could be seen as undignifying treatment, and this is certainly not a small technical step.\nIf we are to justify this to our citizens, we first need to know why it is needed at all. Are we heading down the route of using more technology just for the sake that that technology is available, and also, what extent will the technology be used for? I can understand that, in some cases, this should be a secondary measure, where an individual chooses not to be, as we say, frisked by a security official. But as a primary screening measure it is a very serious breach of our basic rights to privacy and is intrusive.\nWe have already seen, with the liquids rules, that the precedent is being set for extra security measures to become the norm in airports. However inconvenient these liquids rules are to passengers, it is certainly not an invasion of privacy", "Explanations of vote\nHubert Pirker\n(DE) Mr President, while I do endorse Mr Mauro's report, I do regret the absence from it, as also from the Commission draft, of any reference to Community grants being tied to measures for protection against noise from rail and road traffic. However much development work might need to be done, the people living nearby also need to be considered, and not only their health but also their acceptance of the work.\nI therefore urge that the rules on protection against noise for rail vehicles be amended as soon as possible to make reference to lower maximum levels and to promote noise abatement measures in exactly the same way as they promote the extension of trans-European networks.\nAndreas M\u00f6lzer\n(DE) Mr President, I have voted against the Mauro report on the grounds that the amount of traffic in Europe is increasing enormously and that overcrowded roads and permanent traffic jams presage the collapse of the transport system. Although it was many years ago that we decided what projects would form the Trans-European Transport networks, we are lagging far behind when it comes to putting them in place, so that what should be Europe's masterpiece is still more like a piece of patchwork.\nWe must also do something about making rail travel more appealing, and I believe that should be done not only for transnational traffic, but also, and to an increasing extent, for local travel.\nPedro Guerreiro \nAlthough the proposal for a regulation on the granting of Community financial aid in the field of the trans-European transport and energy networks provides for an increase in the current level of Community cofinancing, it falls short of what the original proposal as regards both the transport and energy networks, due to the detrimental agreement on the financial perspective for 2007-2013.\nThere is a further fundamental issue at stake here. The 'trans-European networks' are implemented with Community and Member State funding - in other words, clearly p", "3. Wilderness in Europe (\nGyula Hegyi\nrapporteur. - Mr President, as we did not have a plenary debate on this item and there was no possibility to table amendments following the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, you either have to trust your rapporteur - myself - or reject the whole resolution. In my view, it is not a good system, but that is the current tool.\nMany aspects of the Natura 2000 Directives should be reopened in the near future in any case and hopefully, the legislative act will cover the wilderness areas as well, giving full opportunity for the next Assembly to go further on this beautiful topic. I hope that my resolution will become a basis for further legislative actions providing the possibility for members to improve it in the future.\n", "Entry into force on 1 August 2010 of the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) and the role of the EU (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the entry into force on 1 August 2010 of the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) and the role of the EU.\nCatherine Ashton\nVice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Madam President, I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to discuss the issue of cluster munitions. I believe this is an important moment to do so, less than one month before the entry into force of the Convention on Cluster Munitions.\nAs this House knows, this Convention, originally a Norwegian initiative, will prohibit all use, stockpiling, production and transfer of cluster munitions. Similarly to anti-personnel landmines, cluster munitions pose - as honourable Members know - a serious threat to the lives of civilians by causing indiscriminate damage, particularly affecting children.\nThe very nature of cluster munitions goes against basic humanitarian principles. Not only do they release small bomblets over a wide area with indiscriminate effects, they also leave behind a large amount of unexploded ordnance that can explode at any time, even decades after a conflict has ended. That is why the European Union is committed to making every effort to achieve a complete ban on these deadly devices.\nThe Convention on Cluster Munitions was agreed in December 2008. In only a year and a half, 106 states have signed the convention and 36 have ratified it. In a way that reminds us of the inspiring dynamic triggered by the entry into force of the Ottawa Convention on Anti-Personnel Landmines, we can expect significant progress in our common efforts to reduce - and eventually eliminate - the production, use and transfer of cluster munitions.\nThe European Union as a whole is fully ", "3. Draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2010 as modified by the Council (vote) \nBefore the vote:\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Surj\u00e1n\nrapporteur. - Mr President, we are about to hold probably the shortest vote on the budget under the Nice Treaty, and it is sure that this will be the last vote under the Nice Treaty.\nHow is it possible that the voting list is so short? It is due to the excellent cooperation of the groups. As a rapporteur, I should like to thank all the groups who participated in the preparation of this vote. In addition to that, I should like to thank the Secretariat for its work. Without them, it would also have been impossible to have been here with just these two pages. Thank you very much to all of you.\n(Applause)\nAnd I think that this shortness is justified, for, in a time of crisis, we should work to manage the crisis and not spend time on lengthy votes.\nVladim\u00edr Ma\u0148ka\nMr President, I propose that we vote on the Other Institutions block in a single vote as I am not expecting any problems. Thank you.\nPresident\nA situation has arisen in which we are voting on different institutions, and in accordance with the rules, we are obliged to vote on each institution separately. It is not possible to combine it all into one block. That would be contrary to procedure.\nHans Lindblad\nMr President, the Council notes with satisfaction that Parliament has confirmed the agreement that we reached at the conciliation meeting on 18 November this year. In conjunction with the outcome of the second reading in the Council, we are happy that Parliament's second reading can be deemed to represent a common text from the two parts of the budgetary authority in accordance with the new Article 314 of the Treaty of Lisbon.\nThe Council accepts this common text and the President of the European Parliament can thus declare the budget finally approved. However, I would like to point out that once you, Mr President, have declared the budget finally approved, the Council beli", "3. Russia: attacks on human rights defenders, and the Anna Politkovskaya murder trial\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Russia.\nMarios Matsakis\nauthor. - Madam President, Russia is one of the EU's most important trading partners. Amongst other things, it is responsible for supplying EU Member States with a large percentage of their energy needs. Furthermore, today's Russia is not what that country was in the past. In this respect we are pleased, for we wholeheartedly wish Russia to be a modern and democratic nation with which we can cooperate to further world peace and prosperity. Unfortunately, our wishes - and now our trust-building - are being shaken by the violation of human rights and disrespect for the rule of law that is still taking place in Russia, albeit at a much reduced rate. A good example is the totally unacceptable way that the whole affair concerning the brutal murder of Anna Politkovskaya in 2006 has been handled by the Russian authorities.\nWith this motion for a resolution, we call upon the Russian Government to do its utmost to ensure that the road to democratic reforms taken by Russia, and its consequent cooperation with the EU, are not put in jeopardy by the human rights violations still occurring in that country.\nJ\u00f3zef Pinior\nauthor. - (PL) Madam President, Elena Bonner spoke here yesterday, at the Sacharov Prize award ceremony, which she attended with her daughter, Tatjana Yankelevich. Her words still echo in this Chamber today. They were significant words indeed - conveying a message to the Europe of today, to the world of today, from someone who survived the totalitarian regime in Russia and who represents the true voice of Russia in today's world.\nWe, in the European Parliament, are concerned by the current situation in that great country. Lawyers and human rights activists are persecuted, intimidated, threatened with violence and live in fear for their lives. This is all part and parcel of Russia's cur", "2. Humanitarian situation of refugees from Iraq (vote) \n- Before the vote on Amendment No 5:\nAlyn Smith\nMr President, we propose in paragraph 5, line 4, to delete the words 'the European Parliament' on the grounds that it is a little linguistically untidy and perhaps a little illogical for Parliament to call on 'the Parliament' to take part in this international conference.\n(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)\n-Before the vote on Amendment No 7:\nAlyn Smith\nMr President, on this amendment to paragraph 7, we would in no way limit our praise of the Swedish Government, but the figure listed in paragraph 7 - 8951 - is just factually incorrect. We would propose that the words 'which granted asylum to 8951 Iraqis in 2006,' be deleted. That will help the flow of the paragraph, while still praising the Swedish Government's efforts.\n(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)\n", "36. Consequences of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon for ongoing interinstitutional decision-making procedures (\nTakis Hatzigeorgiou\n(EL) Just a couple of seconds to explain the withdrawal of our amendment: we have withdrawn our amendment in the absolute and firm conviction that the Conference of Presidents, which is to examine the issue, will take very serious account of the spirit and letter of our amendment.\nI would remind the House that we call in our amendment for the Commission to examine the change to the regulation on direct trade between the European Union and areas of Cyprus which are not under the control of the Republic of Cyprus.\n", "Control of the budgetary implementation of the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is a short presentation of the report by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on Control of the Budgetary Implementation of the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) in 2007.\nRodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to reiterate that the instrument for pre-accession assistance is the Union's new financing instrument for granting pre-accession assistance for the period 2007-2013 and replaces the previous programmes for candidate and potential candidate countries, namely the PHARE, CARDS, ISPA and other programmes.\nThe new instrument includes five components which cover the priorities defined in accordance with the needs of the beneficiary country, namely transition assistance and institution building, cross-border cooperation, regional development, human resources development and rural development.\nThis report by Parliament is the first examination of the application of this new instrument and has a twofold objective:\nfirstly, to bring the project financed more closely into line with pre-accession priorities, especially for the environment, gender equality, nuclear safety and increased employment;\nsecondly, to avoid the mistakes of the past, such as those belatedly identified in the application of the PHARE, SAPARD and ISPA programmes in Bulgaria and Romania.\nWe believe that this can be better achieved if Parliament closely monitors the application of the new instrument from the outset, which is why we called for this own-initiative report.\nParliament expresses its satisfaction in this motion for a resolution at the high implementation rate of IPA commitments in 2007 and its regret at the considerable delays both in approving the relevant regulations and implementing the programmes which started in 2008. We would also point out that th", "1.

I propose to correct them as follows: in recital B, to replace the word 'authors' with the word 'perpetrators', and in recital C, to replace the words 'intellectual authors' with the word 'instigators'.\nPresident\nAre there any objections to the inclusion of these oral amendments?\n(The oral amendments were accepted)\n", "Seventh EU programme for research, technological development and demonstration (debate) \nPresident\n\u03a4he next item is the report by Mr Audy, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union for research, technological development and demonstration activities (\u03917-0160/2011).\nJean-Pierre Audy\nMadam President, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn, ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here to evaluate the Seventh Framework Programme for research (2007-2013), which has a budget of EUR 51 billion. It is the biggest programme in the world, and this amount should be compared to the EUR 17 billion for the 2000-2006 programme, which covered five years, whereas this one covers seven.\nThe negotiations on the Seventh Framework Programme took place in 2006 and cover - I repeat - the period 2007-2013. Following those negotiations, we now have three new elements, which require us to turn our attention to the evaluation of the programme.\nFirstly, the European Union is getting over the failure of the Lisbon strategy, which was devised by the European Council in 2000 with a view to making the European Union the world's knowledge-based economy by 2010. We now have the Europe 2020 strategy. The second new element: the failure of the constitutional treaty. Today, the Treaty of Lisbon is in force and brings with it new powers. The third new element: the financial crisis that reached us from the United States in 2008.\nIn view of those three new elements, we must give thought to the years 2011-2013. We are living in extremely fragile post-crisis years and, in these times of scarce public resources, the sums at stake are substantial. EUR 26 billion has been programmed for the first three years. We have EUR 28.5 billion left to programme in 2011, 2012 and 2013. We must therefore think carefully about the messages that we want to send to the European Commission so that it adapts its research policy to the major challenge", "1.

I would like to give a warm welcome to Mr Zapatero, who will speak on behalf of the Council. Mr Zapatero, you have the floor.\nJos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am attending this debate to report to you and to take stock of what the Spanish rotating Presidency has accomplished in these six months. When I attended at the beginning of this term, I explained to you that I had two main objectives during this political period.\nThe first of these was the implementation and entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, a treaty seeking a more complete union for Europe. The second main objective, directly related to that ambition of ever-closer unity among Europeans, was to achieve, with a view to the recovery of the economic situation, a much deeper union with regard to economic policy, to address the imbalances in our economies and to create more appropriate conditions for the European Union to improve its competitiveness and maintain its well-being.\nThese have been the two main objectives. I can assure you that, in implementing the Treaty of Lisbon, the Spanish rotating Presidency has discharged its functions dutifully to ensure the new institutional balance and to strengthen the new institutions that we Europeans have created for ourselves through the Treaty of Lisbon: namely, the Presidency of the European Council, the purpose of which is to strengthen European representation and ensure the continuity of political programmes within the framework of the European Union, and the High Representative, intended to strengthen common action in matters of foreign policy.\nThis new institutional balance also includes a fundamental watershed in the spirit and the letter of the Treaty of Lisbon.

We wish to extend our deepest sympathy to the victims and express our outrage at the murderers who were responsible.\nThose who follow the European media and those who, for example, have read today's edition of Daily Outlook Afghanistan will know that violence in Afghanistan has now become much more widespread and commonplace. Teachers are being shot practically every day, which is one of the most cynical aspects of the Taliban strategy. Schools, and especially girls' schools, are being burnt down or forced to close, bridges and roads are being blown up. What was not reported in Europe was the attack by the US-led coalition forces on a wedding party in the province of Nangarhar on Sunday that left 23 people dead, including the bride. A similar incident also occurred in the neighbouring province of Urusgan. President Karsai has now ordered an investigation.\nIt is clear that the security situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated in the last three years. However, there are many distinctly positive developments to be considered too: advances in education and health policy, regional success in the rebuilding programme and in the eradication of drugs, the creation of a critical and independent media thanks to a number of incredibly courageous journalists, and the establishment in many areas of an active civil society along with spirited women's organisations.\nHowever, there are also negative aspects to report, such as the fact that the growing of opium poppies has now reached record levels nation", "Order of business\nPresident\nMrs Oomen-Ruijten has asked for the floor.\nRia Oomen-Ruijten\non behalf of the PPE Group. - (NL) Mr President, we discussed Russia in our last part-session.

This will be done in a few minutes. This package will constitute our financial supervisory activities adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure.\nToday we are signing into law a European Systemic Risk Board which will be responsible for the oversight of the financial system within the Union and will contribute to the smooth functioning of the internal market.\nSecondly, we are also establishing three other European supervisory authorities to protect the public interest. They will monitor banks, securities and markets, as well as insurance and occupational pensions.\nFinally, we are signing an omnibus directive which amends a whole set of 11 directives in order to bring them into line with the European system of financial supervision and the Treaty of Lisbon.\nAn enormous effort has been made and there has been great cooperation, I found, between the European institutions. The procedure was very fast and effective. Successive presidencies, the Spanish and the Belgian, were very active, and I thank them for their cooperation. The Commission was very active and cooperation was very close. To the Members of the European Parliament, staying in this Chamber while we go and sign, and to the Commissioner I say: it is a great deal. I thank the Commission, which was so active all the time in the preparatory meetings and all the discussions, for its engagement.\nBut our work of course is not finished. The economic governance package we are shortly debating will be very important as well. We know well that it is under way in our legislative procedure and we hope we will be ready as quickly as possible.\nWhat can I say in conclusion? The whole package which we are signing today will start to apply in the European Union from 1 January 2011, so very soon. This is very important information for all of us, for the markets and for our", "Commission measures in 2008-2013 to make use of CAP remote-sensing applications (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the measures to be undertaken by the Commission in 2008-13 making use of the remote-sensing applications developed within the framework of the common agricultural policy - C6-0273/2007 -.\nMariann Fischer Boel\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, before going into the content of the report, I first of all want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for the work that they have been doing on the evaluation of the Commission's proposal.\nI would first like to make a few more general remarks to place the Commission's proposal in the right context. The Commission's proposal concerns the agro-meteorological system utilised to prepare the crop yields forecast and to monitor the development of crops within the European Union. This system was developed throughout the 1990s and has been fully operational since 1998. I must say that I consider this to be a very useful tool.\nThis system provides the Commission's services with accurate information on the situation in the crop sector and also assists the Commission in taking timely decisions in the framework of the common agricultural policy, and therefore I find that it is quite natural that it is financed by the guidance funding.\nLet me say the following on some of the proposals in the Committee on Agriculture report. You have concerns about the use of the data that are collected. I want to be very clear on this. Control is not the aim of this system and it cannot and will not be used for any control of farmers within the European Union.\nWhen we look at it from a technical point of view, the resolution of the remote-sensing images generated by the system is far too low ", "\n\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is the report by Mr\u00a0Cornillet on behalf of the Committee on Development on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2005 [2005/2104(INI)] (A6-0063/2006). \nThierry Cornillet (ALDE ),\n\u00a0\u00a0 . Mr\u00a0President, the report on the work of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2005 is actually included on the agenda. I will not go back over the detail of the report and will merely refer to two sessions, that in Bamako in April\u00a02005 and that in Edinburgh in November\u00a02005, without forgetting the next session, which will be held in Vienna in June\u00a02006. I should like to point out in this Chamber just how worthwhile it is, as was the case this year, for sessions organised in Europe to be held in the country holding the Presidency. It does, in fact, seem extremely logical to maintain and to perpetuate this system, which was adopted two years ago.\nI should also like to highlight the very solid contribution of our colleagues from the ACP countries, and we must congratulate them on that. We simultaneously conducted six joint missions, and allow me for the first - but not the last - time to emphasise the adjective \u2018joint\u2019. It is essential, in fact, that both the Permanent Assembly and the missions share a joint vision of matters. To do the opposite would make no sense at all. I should also like to point out that an increasing number of horizontal votes between the ACP countries and the EU representation have been held. In my opinion, the practice of separating houses must be drawn on as little as possible without it being necessarily removed from our Rules of Procedure. That being said, it is true that the objective, in the long term, would be to hold an increasing number of votes that make it possible to secure an ACP-EU majority.\nFurthermore, it appears that our colleagues from the ACP countries are less involved in what we might call an \u2018intellectual\u2019 capacity. By that I mean that we are in agreement with them on the fact that what was an expen", "Situation in Georgia (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Georgia.\nCecilia Malmstr\u00f6m\nMr President, we are touching on many different areas here this afternoon, and that is what is so wonderfully exciting about sitting here in the Council Presidency chair. The subject that we are now going to debate is Georgia. It is an issue that I know interests the European Parliament and that I personally have very strong feelings about. Right at the start, I would like to make it clear that the EU is giving its full support to the stabilisation and normalisation of Georgia and to democratic reforms in the country.\nWe are assisting Georgia in several very specific ways: through the EU monitoring mission (EUMM), through our active involvement and our key role in the talks in Geneva, and through increased EU financial aid to ease the humanitarian situation and to support Georgia's economic recovery.\nWith the launch of the Eastern Partnership, the EU has strengthened relations with Georgia, as well as with other countries. We are offering an opportunity to upgrade relations by means of an association agreement and extensive free-trade areas. Georgia's goal is, of course, to achieve stability and prosperity. We will help them do this. However, in order for genuine progress to be made, Georgia must maintain its focus on democratic reforms. We attach a great deal of importance to issues relating to good social management and human rights. We appreciate the fact that Georgia is determined to continue with its democratic reforms and is particularly resolute about a second wave of reforms.\nBecoming an established democracy where citizens enjoy fundamental freedoms and human rights will bring major advantages for Georgia. It will benefit the country itself and the people who live there, of course, but it will also be beneficial through the creation of better opportunities for those living in the separatist regions. The political env", "Recommendation to the Council on the new EU-Russia agreement (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Janusz Onyskiewicz, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the new EU-Russia agreement.\nJanusz Onyszkiewicz\nMr President, this report describes the relationship between the European Union and Russia as being of key significance for the Union's economic and political interests. It emphasises the role that Russia can and should play in the international arena, notably in our immediate neighbourhood, where it can contribute to the economic and political stability of the region.\nIn addition, however, the report draws attention to Russia's disproportionately strong reaction to Georgia's armed intervention in South Ossetia and to the large-scale and unprovoked action by Russian forces in Abkhazia. The report highlights the need for meaningful dialogue on security matters. This should be a dialogue based on respect for international law and the territorial integrity of states. The report points out too that events in the Caucasus and recognition of the independence of both enclaves, Ossetia and Abkhazia, cast doubt over whether Russia really is ready and able to build a common area of security in Europe together with the European Union.\nThe report suggests that talks on full compliance by Russia with the commitments and agreements that ended the Georgian conflict should be brought to a conclusion prior to the adoption of any negotiated agreement. That would involve agreement on the status of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The report also calls for Russia to enter into firm commitments not to use force against its neighbours.\nIn addition, the report points out that recent events involving Russia's attack on Georgia's territorial integrity endanger the relationship between the European Union and Russia, as does Russia's part in the gas supply crisis.\nThe report indicates the advisability of replacing the current agreement with a new and broader one. Such an", "The European Union's role in Iraq (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Gomes, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the European Union's role in Iraq.\nAna Maria Gomes\nrapporteur. - (PT) Madam President, as this House is about to vote on a report on the European Union's role in Iraq, it is important to look at some of the lessons learnt from the history of that country. On 16 March it will be 20 years since the chemical attack on the Kurdish city of Halabja, one of the most deadly operations in the Anfal genocidal campaign conducted by the forces of Saddam Hussein against his own people. Halabja was not a one-off; there were many Halabjas throughout Iraq. For decades, given the passivity and occasional connivance of European governments, Saddam Hussein's regime subjected the Iraqi people to a strategy of systematic brutalisation with devastating consequences which are still being felt today. That is why, as rapporteur, I wanted the fundamental axiom of this report to be the moral and legal responsibility of Europe towards the Iraqi people. No people have suffered more in recent decades and few countries are strategically more important to Europe's security.\nBesides being a matter of duty, Europe must realise that it has an interest in consolidating a federal and democratic Iraq where the rule of law prevails and where human rights are respected, including the rights of women. In 2003 my party, the Portuguese Socialist Party, and myself personally were opposed to the decision to invade Iraq supported by the then Prime Minister of my country, Mr Dur\u00e3o Barroso. I still maintain this position. However, this report must not be used to reiterate our well-known positions on an issue that has divided Europe in the past. This House is being called on to give its opinion on the present and future contribution of the European Union to a secure, prosperous and democratic Iraq that", "Preparation for the European Council (14-15 December 2006) (continuation of debate) \nJos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso\nMr President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, the June European Council marked an important stage in proceedings for several reasons. I should like to mention one in particular. I believe that the June Council put to bed once and for all the idea that there is some kind of arbitration between the institutional progress made by the Union and the implementation of new policies. Previously, it was often said that, if you spoke of the political agenda, an agenda focused on results, on practical projects, you were in some ways sidestepping the institutional debate. If you spoke of the Constitution, on the other hand, you were accused of navel-gazing, of being obsessed with technical aspects. I believe that this idea has been buried for good.\nThe two-level strategy adopted in June shows how the two aspects are linked and how they can mutually enhance one another. Indeed, for as long as we have to work with a Union that is less effective and less democratic than we know it could be, our efforts to implement the policies expected by our people will never be entirely convincing. Each time we put forward policies designed to improve our citizens' lives, it can only make people feel more confident about a further step being taken on the road to European integration.\nThe Finnish Presidency has demonstrated a perfect understanding of this state of affairs, hence six months of pragmatic and targeted progress. Those six months have shown that there is a genuine understanding of what Parliament, the Council and the Commission can offer Europe when they work together. The results are there to see: an agreement on sensitive issues, such as REACH, the adoption of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund - I am particularly proud of that because, as you know, it was a Commission initiative - a rapid reaction to the Lebanese crisis, the smooth preparation for Bulgaria's and Romania's acc", "6. International carriage of passengers by coach and bus (recast) (\n- Before the vote:\nHannes Swoboda\n(DE) Mr President, in the interests of fairness, I announced on Monday that we would be requesting the postponement of the vote on this report, not because Mr Grosch has done a bad job - quite the contrary - but because we want to take more time to look at the issue of rest periods and integrate it in precise terms in this report. We have held talks with the groups and have found that there is considerable backing for this proposal. Even Mr Jarzembowski, who was most difficult to convince, advised me this morning that he now supports the proposal. I therefore hope that we can deal with the matter in this way, and so I request postponement to one of the two next part-sessions.\nMathieu Grosch\nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, as the rapporteur, I agree with the proposal, as does the PPE-DE Group, and I would like to make it clear that we have taken note of the agreement between the social partners. However, we are using the time with a view to incorporating this into an amendment.\n(Parliament approved the proposal)\n", "13. International Trade Policy in the context of Climate Change imperatives (\nYannick Jadot\nMr President, we propose changing the end of paragraph 22 by replacing 'prevent' with 'inform', so the final phrase becomes:\n'reiterates also Parliament's request to the Commission and Member States to inform the European Parliament about loans granted by export credit agencies and the European Investment Bank to projects that have a negative impact on the climate'.\n", "6. Agreement EC-Ukraine in relation to preservation of commitments on trade in services (\n- Before the vote:\nZbigniew Zaleski\nrapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, since the situation in Ukraine is quite serious, I would like to make a comment on this report. It is a purely economic report but we need a broader strategy which, following the example of Euromed, makes room for EURO-NEST, another union, which would be based in Lublin, Poland.\nWe must learn from the crisis in Georgia and ensure that we do not wake up one day outside the political stage, having allowed another actor to take our place.\nTo conclude, I would like to urge all my fellow Members to support this report in order to send a strong signal to the Ukrainians, who have Europe strongly in their sights and who now find themselves in an extremely difficult crisis.\n", "7. Assessment of the results of the 2006-2010 Road map for Equality between women and men and forward looking recommendations (\n- Before the vote\nAstrid Lulling\n(FR) Mr President, I refer to Rule 175(2) of the Rules of Procedure in order to request, on behalf of my group, that this report be referred back to committee.\nThe fact is that having carefully compared the Romeva i Rueda report, on which we have just voted, with the Figueiredo report, we found that there are absolutely identical passages in both reports: recitals and articles of which the content is identical, even though the wording may not be exactly the same. In addition, this report mostly just repeats what was already included in the Tarabella report on equality between men and women, on which we voted here in February.\nI do not know who these uninspired authors are, or who is responsible for this plagiarism. However, to avoid making this Parliament look ridiculous, the report must be referred back to committee, especially since it has also missed its target.\n(Applause)\nMr President, I do not understand why the secretariat of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality has failed to notice this situation. This is not good legislative work. Send it back!\n(Applause)\nIlda Figueiredo\nMr President, Mrs Lulling and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) know that there was intense debate on this report, which included contributions from MEPs of all parties, or almost all; they know that a clear majority in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality voted in favour of it and that there were only two votes against it, one of which was by Mrs Lulling and the other by another Member. There were no other votes against: the majority voted in favour of it and there was a group that abstained.\nThat being the case, her opinion is not the opinion of the majority of the committee and I hope that it will not be the view of the majority of this House. As everyone who participated ", "Afghanistan: one year after the Bonn Agreement\nPresident.\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on Afghanistan, one year after the Bonn Agreement.\nMr Yiannitsis, President-in-Office of the Council, has the floor.\n\nYiannitsis\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is now a year since the Bonn Agreement was signed in 2001 and, as we look back over what has already been done and what has yet to be done in order to ensure it is fully implemented, I would point out that this Agreement laid the foundations for a new, modern Afghan state and that there is cause for reserved satisfaction with the progress it has made so far.\nOnce a transitional authority and administration had been set up, an emergency Loya Jirga was convened and elected a president. A Judicial Commission and an Independent Human Rights Commission have been set up. A central bank has been established and has introduced a national currency. A drafting committee has been set up as a forerunner to a Constitutional Commission. A proposal has been adopted for a national development framework, which will be used as a guide for rebuilding and improving the situation in the country. President Karzai has issued a decree creating an Afghan national army, an important step towards Afghan ownership in the field of security and stability. On 22 December 2002, Afghanistan and its six neighbours signed the Kabul Declaration of Good Neighbourly Relations, in which they agreed not to interfere in each other's internal affairs; this will do a great deal to foster peace and stability in the region. Generally speaking, President Karzai and the Afghan Transitional Administration have achieved substantial results and the Bonn Process is on the right track.\nDuring the Petersberg Conference on 2 December reaffirming the commitment to supporting the Bonn Agreement on Afghanistan and inject new impetus into efforts to rebuild the country, a declaration was issued containing a clear reference to the obj", "6.

Short selling and certain aspects of credit default swaps (\nPascal Canfin\nMr President, I wanted to propose submitting the report on the legislative proposal to the scrutiny of this House, for the same reasons that we did so regarding the report on derivatives. We have already had four negotiation meetings with the Council. We are now sending a very strong political message, but we are not voting at first reading in order that we can continue the discussions and negotiations in a very practical manner starting next week or in September.\nI would therefore like to request a report concerning the vote on the legislative proposal.\nMichel Barnier\nMr President, I simply want to pass on the thanks of the Commission to Mr Canfin, who has just spoken, as well as to Mr Langen and to the groups who have approved this idea.\nI think that, if we give ourselves the necessary few weeks or days, we are on the verge of reaching an agreement with the Council on these two important subjects: short selling and derivatives. In any case, the Commission wants to make it clear that it is available to contribute to this.\nThese are two major subjects, and, on these two financial subjects, we are finally going to learn most of the lessons of the crisis. That is what the citizens expect, and I would like to thank the European Parliament for giving itself the few days necessary to try and achieve these two dynamic compromises on two important subjects.\n", "Financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Flautre and Mr McMillan-Scott, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on establishing a financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide (European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights) C6-0206/2006.\nPaula Lehtom\u00e4ki\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, decision-making on the part of the Finnish Presidency with regard to the European Union's future financing instruments will soon be at an end. In an excellent show of solidarity, we have dealt with the matter successfully and adopted the majority of the Regulations on the new financing instruments. Although there have been a number of challenges, there has also been immense political will on the part of the European Parliament, the Member States and the Commission to reach agreement on the relevant issues.\nOne challenge still lies ahead, and that is the adoption of the Regulation establishing a European Instrument for the Promotion of Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR). This is an important matter both for Parliament and the Member States, because it concerns the promotion of basic values as enshrined in the Treaty on European Union. Parliament and its Members have specialist knowledge of democracy and human rights issues, which has been a help in endeavours to attain a good outcome.\nThe Regulation on a new human rights instrument to apply worldwide has been drafted to a very tight schedule. As well as Parliament, the Member States too have had numerous proposals for its content. It is a very positive sign that agreement has already been reached on almost all the issues in these negotiations.

Following the Good Friday Agreement and just five weeks after the referendum the new Northern Ireland Assembly is meeting at the same time as we are. It is five minutes into its new programme. This is a historic day for Northern Ireland and given your interest and support for the peace process, would you, on behalf of all Members of Parliament, send a strong message of support for the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, wishing all the elected members well in their work of building peace for the communities of Northern Ireland.\n\nPresident\nMrs McCarthy, as you have said, this Parliament has always been supportive and this morning I sent a telegram to Mrs Marjorie Mowlam. It said: ' On the occasion of this first meeting today, please convey the best wishes of the European Parliament and my own personal best wishes to the new Northern Ireland Assembly. The European Parliament expresses continued solidarity with the people of Northern Ireland and its new assembly in the on-going process of peace and reconciliation' .\n\nBanotti\nMr President, we all know of your full and warm-hearted support. Thank you for your good wishes and for sending the telegram this morning. Let us hope that in the next few days we will not see any breakdown of the current positive actions in Northern Ireland.\nI raised a point at the last session on Parliament's budgetary problems following the judgment of the Court of Justice with the NGO networks working on social cohesion. There is serious and widespread alarm about this. I hope we may be able to get a statement from the Commission.\n\nPresident\nMrs Banotti, if I may say so, you have anticipated the matter by about five minutes.

I wish to thank Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, together with Mr Bradbourn, the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the Committee on Legal Affairs, for their support for the Commission's proposal on SESAR, a major European project.\nYour report, Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges, coincides with the Commission's position, and we support most of your amendments. I shall not go into the details of the debate on all of the amendments that have been tabled, but limit myself instead to a few general remarks.\nFirst of all, I note that Parliament and the Commission take the same view of the strategic importance of major technological and industrial programmes like SESAR and GALILEO. SESAR is a vital programme for the competitiveness of the European aviation industry. It forms part of the Community's technological innovation programme, which lies at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy.\nIn a sector as crucial for the European economy as this one, it is vital that public bodies and the private sector pool their resources to build together what will become the most efficient, most reliable and safest air traffic control infrastructure in the world. This public-private partnership requires a clear division of roles, together with transparent procedures, so that potential conflicts of interest can be pre-empted. The Commission therefore welcomes the amendments tabled by Parliament along these line", "3. Eritrean refugees held hostage in Sinai (\nCarlo Casini\n(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the amendment aims to make our judgment on Egypt's actions more incisive. It is not only a matter of acknowledging that Egypt has at least done something, but asking it to intervene quickly and immediately to free these hostages, urging the country never to use lethal force to repel people crossing the Sinai. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is also called upon to make immediate contact with the people currently being held hostage.\n'urges the Egyptian authorities to take all necessary measures to secure the release of Eritreans held hostage, to avoid the use of lethal force against illegal immigrants crossing the borders of the country, to protect their dignity and their physical and psychological integrity and to guarantee that detained migrants have the opportunity to contact the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and that the High Commissioner has access to all asylum seekers and refugees in custody'.\nDavid-Maria Sassoli\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to add a paragraph to the resolution, which we feel is important and will not affect the structure of it too much. It concerns paragraph 9 of the joint resolution.\nI shall read it: 'invites Member States to tackle this humanitarian emergency through the voluntary resettlement in the European Union of all the asylum seekers involved in this crisis; asks the European Commission to coordinate this operation and use available funding through the European Refugees Fund'.\nCarlo Casini\n(IT) Mr President, I should like to ask the proposer of the amendment to clarify an issue.\nAccording to the text read out, the requested intervention concerns all those who request the right of asylum. I should rather say 'those who have the right of asylum', because 'who request' is too dangerous, as there is the risk that anyone can request the right of asylum.\nVice-ve", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nMetten\nMr President, I have a question and a comment concerning page 7 of the Minutes, at least in the Dutch version. I refer to the letter from Mr Pasty to President H\u00e4nsch which was read out yesterday by the President. And particularly to the following sentence: ' I am therfore entitled to wonder what the real reasons behind this letter (of President H\u00e4nsch's) are and what its purpose is.' We heard the text yesterday, of course, but perhaps not everybody took it fully on board. There is a clear insinuation here against the integrity of the President of Parliament. My personal reaction to this is that I consider it a disgraceful letter and I ask myself, and I ask you and the Bureau of Parliament too, whether Members can be allowed to question the integrity of Parliament's President in this manner with impunity? In other words: can he get away with this? Are such procedures acceptable in this House or not? My own view is that this is quite disgraceful and unacceptable. I ask you to put this question to the Bureau: is it acceptable for the integrity of Parliament's President to be questioned in this way? If not, I think the Bureau should consider the consequences.\n\nPresident\nMr Metten, your comments are not related to the Minutes but to the interpretation of what was said or maintained yesterday. I note your observation. It goes without saying that from the Chair I cannot accept any doubt about the integrity of the President or whoever was in the Chair at the time, and that is a position with which the entire House agrees.\n\nPack\nMr President, I wish to draw your attention to an error in the Minutes. During the debate with the President-in-Office of the Council I did not complain that he had not answered the questions put by a Dutch Member but that he had not replied to my questions on Serbia.

The amounts that have been dedicated by the European Union to these bailouts dwarf the domestic spending of our national governments. The United Kingdom alone has so far made available GBP 7 billion in Ireland and it is now about to be asked for another GBP 4.2 billion in Portugal.\nGBP 7 billion is more than the value of all the domestic cuts we have made in social security put together - and all for a policy which is now visibly failing. When the Greek bailout was originally agreed we were told that it would be enough to deter the speculators, that Greece would now be borrowing competitively in the market and that no more would be needed. Yet, we now see Greece openly negotiating for a default and for further loans.\nIt is clear that we are not going to see the money again. It is also clear that we are breaking the law. These bailouts are not merely unauthorised under the Treaties, they are expressly prohibited and, worst of all, they are damaging to the recipient countries. There is a racket - a Ponzi scheme - whereby governments and banks connive to give money to European bankers and bondholders, while expecting the repayment to come from ordinary European taxpayers. Ireland and Greece are now having to borrow more money to send to Portugal, while at the same time Ireland and Portugal are having to borrow more money to send to Greece.\nLet me finish by quoting my countryman Rudyard Kipling.\n'You will find it better policy to say:--\n'We never pay any-one Dane-geld,\nNo matter how trifling the cost;\nFor the end of that game is oppression and shame,\nAnd the nation that plays it is lost!'\nAshley Fox\nMadam President, we have voted today on the 2009 accounts at a time when governments across Europe are having to take austerity measures: expenditure is being cut and taxes are being increased.

Right to vote and stand in elections to the European Parliament for EU citizens residing in a foreign Member State (vote) \n- Report: Duff\n- Before the vote:\nAndrew Duff  \nrapporteur. - Mr President, the report supports the Commission's proposals to streamline procedures for those citizens who wish to stand or vote at an election to the European Parliament in their state of residence. It fully respects national law and practices, and it pushes forward the argument for the future about extending cross-border democracy. Would Members please support the committee resolution without amendment.\nFranco Frattini\nVice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Duff, for his report, which is full of ideas. Some of the amendments being put forward by the European Parliament go well beyond what the Commission is proposing in order to resolve certain administrative difficulties in the application of the Directive, as were identified in its report on the elections of 2004.\nHowever, I fully understand the motivations behind some of Parliament's amendments - and moreover the Commission supports these too - particularly the need to improve the degree of citizen participation in European elections and the European make-up of elections to the European Parliament. This is all linked to questions concerning the exclusion of dual candidacy, which one of the amendments seeks to do away with, and the automatic process leading to loss of rights to stand as a candidate.\nThe Commission is therefore in favour of a more detailed examination of these issues, if necessary by conducting a proper study, and the European Parliament will obviously be involved in this process. These questions could also be discussed, if necessary, by the interinstitutional information group, which is currently exploring all possible ways in which the dissemination of information on the 2009 European elections can be made somewhat more effective.\nRichard Corbett\nMr Pre", "3. Situation in the Middle East/Gaza Strip (vote) \n- Before the vote:\nMartin Schulz\n(DE) Mr President, I am obliged to you for giving me the floor. With your permission and that of my fellow Members, I should like to make two comments, the first on the resolution being put to the vote, and the second a personal statement regarding a Member of this House.\nOn the subject of the resolution, my group discussed this again yesterday evening. The discussion was very in-depth and very passionate, but also very thoughtful. I believe that, this morning, as we prepare to vote, we are all shaken by what Mr Wurtz has just told us. When armed hostilities escalate such that international institutions are no longer secure, the situation is extremely serious. An appeal must be made to Israel in particular, in this case, to respect the bodies of the international community, as failure to do so puts the humanitarian infrastructure at risk, which is certainly not consistent with international law.\nWe have decided to support this resolution, however, as - following yesterday's lengthy discussion - we believe that it is right and vital to adopt it now, and that it is necessary for us, for the European Parliament as an institution, to send out such signals. One thing is quite certain, however, and that is that when violence escalates such that it does not even spare schools and kindergartens, it is a matter not for regret, but for condemnation in the strongest terms. Although this is not contained in the resolution,\n(Loud applause)\nwe do want to emphasise it here, as we believe that this reflects the feelings of many of our fellow Members, including those from other groups.\nAllow me to say a few words today about a colleague who, throughout his political career, has made a particular contribution to peace in the world and in the European Union. This is the last plenary sitting my colleague Mr Rocard will be attending. For us in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, but I believe", "EU-Russia summit (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by the Commission, on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, on the EU-Russia Summit.\n\u0160tefan F\u00fcle\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable Members, I am grateful for this opportunity to discuss with you the next European Union-Russia Summit which will start tomorrow in Nizhny Novgorod. The European Union will be represented by the Presidents of the European Council and the Commission. High Representative and Vice-President Ashton will attend, as will Commissioner De Gucht.\nThe summit has been carefully prepared by the External Action Service working in close cooperation with the Commission and the two Presidents, preparations built on the debates held in the European Council and the Council, on Russia as a Strategic Partner in late 2010 and in January 2011, on the results of the previous EU-Russia Summit, and the visit by the Russian Government to the Commission in February.\nOverall, our relations have improved over the last two years. We have concluded bilateral negotiations on Russian WTO accession, agreed on the approach towards a possible future visa-waiver regime, and agreed the Partnership for Modernisation, which is now in its implementation phase.\nWork is also ongoing in the regular framework of the Four Common Spaces and all its technical dialogues. Our interaction is quite intense. Let me remind you that Russia is the only external partner with whom the European Union holds two annual summits. The visit by Prime Minister Putin and an unprecedentedly large Russian Government delegation to the Commission on 24 February was a clear sign of Russian determination to seek closer relations and cooperation.\nNevertheless, many significant bilateral issues remain unresolved. Of particular concern is the situation regarding democratic development and human rights in Russia. In the context of upcoming Duma an", "VOTES\nKirsten Jensen\n. (DA) The Danish Social Democrats today voted for the report on the Commission communication concerning the development of the social dialogue at Community level.\nThe social dialogue is an effective tool which should be built upon with a view to creating and further developing economic and social cohesion in the EU. The Danish Social Democrats consider that the sectoral dialogue in this context is especially important, since the specific expertise of the participants is particularly suited to ensuring that the benefit of direct practical experience is brought to the social dialogue. In addition, we are very favourably disposed to the view taken in the report that representatives from the future Member States in Eastern and Central Europe be involved as observers in the social dialogue.\nThe Danish Social Democrats welcome the Commission's support in its communication for the principle of the autonomy of parties by emphasizing that only the social partners themselves can develop their own dialogue and negotiating structure.\nFor the same reason, the Danish Social Democrats are opposed to the call in the report for the European Parliament to be granted a power of co-decision. Along with the trade unions and employers' organizations in Denmark, the Danish Social Democrats consider that the EU institutions should not have powers to amend agreements concluded by the social partners themselves.\n\nLis Jensen\n. (DA) There are many reasons why I cannot vote for this report. It is one more example of how social and labour market policy is being used as a means of furthering integration, with the aim of securing a uniform policy in these fields, partly in the interests of freedom of movement and partly in order to promote competitiveness in the EU. It also seeks to gain more power for the European Parliament, placing it on an equal footing with the Council.\nI absolutely reject this and once more insist that social and labour market policy must remain a natio", "Suspension of the WTO Doha Round (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the suspension of the WTO Doha Round.\nMariann Fischer Boel\nMember of the Commission. - Madam President, I presume you had expected to see Commissioner Mandelson here tonight, but as you probably know he left the Commission, and I won the lottery to take over from Mr Mandelson here tonight. Having been directly involved in the negotiations in Geneva at the WTO with responsibility for the agricultural sector, I am however happy to be here with you tonight.\nWhile the negotiations in Geneva in July did not succeed, the Doha Round has not been suspended. On the contrary, it has actually been kept active, even over the past few weeks, and it is our intention to contribute constructively to this activity in order to facilitate full ministerial resumption in due course, once the necessary technical analyses now being undertaken by key countries on the remaining problematic issues have been completed.\nThe negotiations that took place in July delivered some real progress. The emerging package outlined a possible balanced outcome which respected the European Union's key requirements in agriculture while delivering valuable benefits for our industrial manufacturers.\nA broad outline of the agreement has emerged on different key issues, including the overall reduction in trade-distorting domestic support in the agricultural sector, the scope that developed and developing countries would retain to shield a limited number of sensitive and special products from tariff cuts, the Swiss formula used to determine tariff cuts for industrial products, and the flexibility to be made available to developing countries to shield a number of industrial products from those cuts. In the assessment made by the Commission, this package contains real value for European business and consumers and would ensure an international legal framework for agriculture fully in line with the 2003 reform. In our opi", "Belarus (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on Belarus.\nCecilia Malmstr\u00f6m\nMr President, honourable Members, the EU's relationship with Belarus is not without its complications. I would like to begin this debate by explaining why the Council took its decision in November concerning the EU's relations with Belarus. I know that this issue is one that is of great interest to many Members.\nWhen we discussed this, we focused on two important aspects. On the one hand, the EU wanted to send a clear signal that we are not happy with the lack of positive progress in recent months. On the other, we wanted to establish the subsequent steps within the framework of our dialogue with Belarus, with the aim of encouraging Minsk to take action in a number of areas.\nI feel that the result was a well-balanced decision that takes these aspects into account. It has three main elements.\nFirstly, we are extending our sanctions while, at the same time, suspending the travel restrictions for almost all the individuals concerned. The exceptions are four people directly linked to the political disappearances and the chair of Belarus's Central Electoral Commission.\nSecondly, we are open to the possibility of visa facilitation and readmission agreements between the EU and Belarus.\nThirdly, there is the prospect of a partnership and cooperation agreement between the EU and Belarus. Naturally, this would require positive developments as regards democracy, human rights and the principles of the rule of law. The Commission has been asked to carry out some preparatory work based on these action plans, which were developed within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy.\nIn our discussions, we took into account the fact that the situation in Belarus is better than it was 18 months ago, despite the fact that there have been some backward steps. The expulsion of a student from university after taking part in an Eastern Partnership forum is a very serious ", "9. Trade in seal products (\nBefore the vote:\nHartmut Nassauer\n(DE) Mr President, I would like to draw attention to an error that has crept into the voting list of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. In the final vote on both the amended proposal and the legislative resolution, it should say 'free votes'. I ask you - and I include the Group here - to bear this in mind.\nHans-Peter Martin\n(DE) Mr President, I would like to ask you which article of the Rules of Procedure allows Groups to correct their voting lists here with your consent? This is an abuse of the parliamentary independence of individual Members!\n", "One-minute speeches on matters of political importance\nPresident\nThe next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.\nGeorgios Papastamkos\n(EL) Mr President, as a member of the Committee on International Trade, I naturally devote some attention to relations between the EU and China. I have therefore noticed that, according to the figures for 2007, the EU trade deficit has risen to around EUR 160 billion.\nThis deficit is a consequence of the serious barriers blocking access to the Chinese market. It is certainly also due to the competitive advantage of Chinese products, but this is based on economic, social and ecological dumping practices.\nHowever, this unequal trade relationship is not the only cause for concern; another is the case of unsafe products coming from China. We should therefore - and I address this message mainly to the Commission - ensure that products from China are subject to thorough, effective inspection, in the interests of public health and the protection of European consumers, and also in the interests of the competitiveness of European products.\nNeena Gill\nMadam President, the turbulent financial events of the last few days have changed the world. We have all been concerned for some time now about the potential problems in the global financial system, but the rapid fall of the major banks, one after the other in quick succession, has been astonishing.\nI therefore welcome the moves by the UK Government today to increase stability. Although it is outside the Eurozone, the measures taken by the UK are all in line with the decisions made yesterday in the Ecofin Council. I only wish that some of the countries in the Eurozone had acted in the same way. In order to get through the challenges we will face, there is an urgent need for the European Union to provide leadership and coordinate a strategy with EU national governments. Europe must take a central role, not a back seat, especially if the EU wants to connect with the people o", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 14 March 1997.\n\nApproval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of the sitting of Friday, 14 March have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nRosado Fernandes\nMr President, before the sitting begins I should like to mention here a political incident which does not appear to me to be very pleasant in so far as it concerns the Honourable Member, Mr Martens, who stated in Lisbon that the party with which I cooperate is a party of the extreme right.\nIn an interview published on 29 March Mr Martens accused the CDS-Partido Popular, with which I work as an independent and of which my colleagues, Mr Gir\u00e3o Pereira and Mrs Celeste Cardona are stalwart members, of being an extreme right-wing party. And why? The answer is simple: because we dared to support a referendum in Portugal on the Maastricht Treaty. Not a serious crime.\nThis party was then expelled from the PPE and it was Mr Martens who came to Lisbon to do this dirty job, making uncharitable threats and by differences of opinion...\n(The President cut the speaker off)\n\nPresident\nMr Rosado Fernandes, that is neither a point of order nor a personal statement, since it is something which took place outside the Parliament. Rule 108 covers the rebuttal of personal remarks made within the Parliament, but not the discussion of a political row which took place outside the Parliament.\nI am sorry, but I cannot allow you to make such a speech now. It is my duty to cut this speech short, since it is bound to give rise to other personal remarks on topics which are neither on the agenda nor have any bearing on the Rules of Procedure. I am sorry, but it must be so.\n\nRosado Fernandes\n... (without microphone) directly personal to us all. I think I have always avoided making personal attacks; it is not my custom to do so and I should like...\nI think that personal attacks are typical of the decadence of our democracy, are t", "One-minute speeches (Rule 150) \nPresident\nThe next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.\nDamien Abad\n(FR) Mr President, we are going through the worst global financial crisis since 1929 and therefore, Europe must not stand idly by. Moreover, the regulation of the international financial system is not a matter for the right, the left, or even the centre: it concerns everyone throughout the world. I firmly believe that Europe must play a leading role, as it was able to do last March when it called on the Commission and the Member States to focus on the issue of taxing international financial activities.\nNow, almost a year later, we must move up a gear and do everything we can to ensure that Europe becomes a source of inspiration and a force for proposals. Hence, I call on the European Parliament to adopt a common, strong and offensive position in favour of the introduction, at international level, of a tax on financial activities.\nWith the French Presidency of the G20, which has made international financial regulation a priority, Europe has a unique opportunity to pioneer a humanist vision in the face of an ever-changing world. With such a tax, we would have a practical, useful and fair instrument. Europe must step up to the mark, and so must the European Parliament.\nMarc Tarabella\n(FR) Mr President, today, 14 February, St Valentine's Day, I would like to point out that one in five women in Europe is the victim of domestic violence.\nIn Europe, 40-50% of women have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace. We are in the 21st century and Europe has still not taken any legislative measures to eradicate violence against women. The European Parliament has repeatedly requested it, the Council has demanded it and the Commission has promised it, but where is the European strategy to combat violence against women?\nViolence against women represents the most serious and most widespread violation of human rights in Europe. We need a European ac", "Formal sitting and debate - 10th anniversary of the euro\nPresident\nThe next item is the formal sitting and debate on the 10th anniversary of the euro.\n(Film)\nMr Juncker, Mr Giscard d'Estaing, Mr Trichet, Mr Almunia, Mrs Ber\u00e8s, ladies and gentlemen.\nThe first of January 2009 was the 10th birthday of our currency, the euro. Here in the European Parliament today, we are celebrating one of the most important and historic decisions that the European Union has taken so far. In a European Union that was growing ever closer economically, the creation of the euro was a logical development in strengthening the common market and simplifying trade within the internal market; even so, when the currencies of 11 sovereign states were replaced by a single currency 10 years ago, there was a great deal of scepticism as to whether the planned single currency would be a success. Its introduction required courage and decisiveness.\nTen years on, we can see not only that the euro is just as trusted as the currencies previously used in the euro area, but also that it has, without doubt, brought about considerable advantages for people and businesses in the European Union.\nThe euro area has become a rock of macroeconomic stability. In view of the size of the economy of the euro area and the fact that the majority of its trade is internal, the euro area has proven to be much better equipped to withstand economic shocks than the Member States previously were with their national currencies.\nParticularly in the recent months of the global financial crisis, the euro has proven to be an important stabilising factor: the single currency has protected us from the worst effects of the most serious financial crisis since the 1930s.\nWithout the European Central Bank and the European System of Central Banks acting as a stabilising factor, the situation in the European Union last autumn would have been considerably worse.\nJust look at Ireland, a country that was particularly badly affected by the financ", "Sustainable agriculture and biogas: review of EU legislation (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Csaba S\u00e1ndor Tabajdi, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on sustainable agriculture and biogas: a need for review of EU legislation.\nCsaba S\u00e1ndor Tabajdi\nrapporteur. - (HU) Mr President, Commissioner Fischer Boel, ladies and gentlemen, in a world of climate change, increasing energy demand and rising prices, it is an absolute priority and a matter of vital interest to the European Union to reduce energy dependence and energy consumption and to diversify energy sources. The increasing use of renewable energies is an integral part of this. We must diversify, and this includes diversification within the area of renewable energies.\nIn the field of renewable energy sources, different countries have different natural endowments, and we must exploit these to the maximum. Biogas holds enormous potential as a renewable energy source and is destined for a great future for a whole number of reasons that are set out in the report tabled for debate today.\nThe first and most important of these reasons, ladies and gentlemen, is that the primary raw material for producing biogas is animal manure, and the fact that we can combine energy production with the treatment of manure for environmental protection purposes. This is one of the most significant advantages of biogas production, although biogas may of course be produced from other materials such as municipal sludge, slaughterhouse waste and energy crops.\nBiogas is a multifunctional energy source: it can be used for electricity generation, for heating, cooling, or drying. Pressurised biogas is suitable for running cars and public transport vehicles and, once it has been purified, biogas can be fed into the natural gas network. Biogas production thus represents a serious opportunity for European energy production. Among other things, if we consider that biogas can be produced from animal manu", "6. Coordination of social security systems (\n- Before the vote:\nJan Cremers\nrapporteur. - (NL) I can be very brief. We discussed the first reading of this dossier less than a year ago. At that point we, as Parliament, pleaded for better provision of information to the employees involved or European citizens who move freely. At the European Parliament's instigation, after the Council of Ministers had determined its position, negotiations started, which we managed to bring to a successful conclusion.\nI should, above all, like to say a word of thanks to my fellow Members, and Jean Lambert in particular. We managed to work well with the European Commission. The Czech Presidency also recognised the significance of this dossier, and I think we achieved a sound result, not least for everyone who wants to move freely in Europe. I should like to leave it there.\n", "Volcanic ash crisis (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the oral question to the Commission by Brian Simpson, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the volcanic ash crisis (B7-0217/10).\nSilvia-Adriana \u0162ic\u0103u\nauthor. - Madam President, Mr Simpson apologises for not being present during the discussion on the ash cloud crisis. Ironically, in view of this evening's discussion, he has been caught up in the flight restrictions related to the ash cloud restrictions in the UK and therefore has been unable to travel to Strasbourg for the discussion. I will therefore be speaking on his behalf this evening.\nThe oral question on the volcanic ash crisis is just as relevant today, in the context of the ongoing disruption to airspace, as it was at the time of the initial eruption of the Icelandic volcano last month, when we saw much of EU airspace closed for six days. We are now dealing not only with the aftermath of that disruption and its financial impact but also with the present ongoing uncertainty of continued and prolonged disruption to European airspace.\nWhile I believe that some important lessons have been learned and acted on following the unprecedented scale, duration and cause of the initial airspace shutdown, it is clear that the response at European level needs to be stepped up a gear in the face of ongoing disruptions.\nFaced with the challenges that the unprecedented nature and unspecified duration and the disruption is causing to air travel, I am concerned today to get assurances that the mechanisms we have in place for coping with the disruption are working effectively and that, where gaps have been identified over the last few weeks, these are being adequately addressed.\nI am pleased to say that the Air Passengers' Rights Regulation has proved vitally important in providing a safety net to ensure that it is not the passengers who bear the brunt of the financial consequences of the disruption and who are not left stranded by the chaos. The airspac", "3. 2006 discharge: European GNSS Supervisory Authority (\n- Before the vote on Amendment 1:\nChristopher Heaton-Harris\nMr President, on a point of order, I just wondered if anybody in this building knew what 'GNSS' stood for.\nPresident\nIn any case, Mr Heaton-Harris, you can be sure that from today onwards we will all know what this acronym stands for.\nThat concludes the vote.\n", "2010 progress report on Turkey (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on the 2010 progress report on Turkey.\nEnik\u0151 Gy\u0151ri\nMadam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to say that it is a great pleasure for me that you have shown such an interest in the matter of enlargement. Even though both the Member States and the candidate countries are facing noticeable challenges, I believe that the enlargement process must go on continuously and consistently on the basis of the performance delivered. In order to achieve this, both parties must remain committed. Knowing the activities of the European Parliament, it is clear that this is the forum where all participants are aware of the significance of our relations with Turkey.\nThese are long-standing relations, which are made even closer by the country's candidate status. At the same time, Turkey is also an important regional actor, and plays a crucial role in a number of significant areas, such as energy security and regional security, as well as the promotion of dialogue between civilisations. Meanwhile, the dramatic international events taking place in our immediate neighbourhood highlight even further the extent of Turkey's significance in the aforementioned areas. Accession negotiations with the country are proceeding in line with the relevant conclusions of the European Council and the Council, as well as the negotiation framework. Despite the negotiations, which are at an advanced stage and are also becoming increasingly complex, the Hungarian Presidency is committed to making progress with regard to all chapters where progress is possible. The work is proceeding even now, and its main focus is currently on chapter eight, that is, competition policy.\nI trust that our Turkish partners will continue with their efforts and that we will soon be able to see results. In its conclusions adopted in December last year, the Council welcomed Turkey's continuous commitment to", "One-minute speeches on matters of political importance (continuation) \nJim Higgins\nMr President, the eCall system in motor vehicles is a major advance in assisting emergency services to get to the scene of an accident as quickly as possible. The device identifies the exact location of the accident so that the medical, police and fire services are able to get to the scene as quickly as possible. This is particularly important in rural and isolated areas and particularly in the case of single car accidents.\neCall is now standard equipment in all new cars in many EU countries. Unfortunately, it is not available in my own country, Ireland, where we still have an unacceptably high level of fatal accidents. I believe that the system should be mandatory in all Member States.\nThis is about saving lives, and this device certainly saves lives. That is the reason I am calling on the Commission to insist that all Member States insist that this device be available in all new motor vehicles.\nVladim\u00edr Ma\u0148ka\n- (SK) According to research from the Institute of Sociology at the Slovak Academy of Sciences, Slovak inhabitants of Hungarian origin are proud to be citizens of the Slovak Republic. This view is held by more than 70% of people, which is the highest percentage in the history of the Slovak Republic.\nThis result sends a clear message, countering the claims of some politicians who are trying to convince Europe that the Hungarian minority in Slovakia is discriminated against. On the floor of the European Parliament some of my colleagues, instead of sitting down at the negotiating table, have for two years preferred a method of communication which radicalises the domestic political scene even more.\nI would like to invite those who care about the friendly co-existence of Hungary and Slovakia to support the efforts of both premiers, who met on Saturday in order to coordinate the fight against extremism and to lead both countries in the direction of good neighbourly relations.\nI appre", "8. Organic production and labelling of organic products (vote) \n- Following the vote on Amendment 111:\nRoberta Angelilli\n(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in accordance with Rule 155, since Amendment 167 tabled by my group is reproduced in full in Amendment 171 by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and since I believe it is important to bring together the largest possible number of votes in order to eliminate accidental contamination of organic produce by GMOs, on behalf of my group I would like to withdraw our amendment if we can co-sign Amendment 171 by the Socialist Group.\n(The Socialist Group in the European Parliament agreed to the inclusion of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group's Amendment 167 in its Amendment 171)\n- Before the final vote:\nMarie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Aubert \nrapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, on the basis of Rule 53 of the Rules of Procedure, I would ask that the report be referred back to the committee.\nIndeed, Amendment 1, which requests a double legal basis - that is to say, Articles 37 and 95 - had extremely broad support in this House, being adopted by 585 votes. Now, the Commissioner replied yesterday that she did not accept this amendment. I therefore think that we must go further in negotiations with the Commission, while retaining the report - which, I am very pleased to say, is constructive - in its present form. We must go further, however, and I therefore ask that the report be referred back to the committee.\n(Applause)\n(Parliament decided to refer the report back to the competent committee)\n", "Major natural disaster in the autonomous region of Madeira (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the major natural disaster in the autonomous region of Madeira.\nG\u00fcnther Oettinger\nMr President, honourable Members, the Commission is concerned and saddened by the terrible events in Madeira, especially by the high number of victims. I would like to extend my sympathy to all of the inhabitants of Madeira affected by the disaster. The Commission extends its condolences to the families of the victims, in particular.\nYesterday, my colleague, Johannes Hahn, as the competent Member of the Commission, was able to talk to the President of the Autonomous Region of Madeira, Mr Jardim, who said that the situation remains serious. However, the regional and national emergency services have it under control. It does not currently require support from the European Civil Protection Mechanism.\nThat said, the damage is so severe that Madeira is hoping for financial aid from the EU Solidarity Fund. The Commission is currently examining all possible means for providing EU financial aid to Madeira. Back in 2003, following the horrific fire disaster, we were able to grant solidarity aid amounting to more than EUR 48 million to Portugal. The Solidarity Fund was created in 2002 to be able to provide financial assistance at EU level to Member States affected by serious natural disasters.\nHowever, the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund is subject to certain criteria being met. The most important prerequisite is the submission of an application for assistance by the Portuguese Government. May I remind you that the Regulation establishing the Solidarity Fund normally only permits mobilisation of the fund for large-scale disasters where the cost of the damage exceeds a threshold of 0.6% of the gross national income of the State affected. For Portugal, this currently means that the cost of the damage must exceed EUR 958 million. However, in exceptional circumstances, and ", "10.

In view of the importance of this Protocol, the Commission has already asked the Council for a mandate for its renegotiation. We have been informed that the Council is currently studying a mandate proposal and will decide shortly.\nOn the strength of Article 218 of the Treaty, which grants Parliament special powers in the final approval of fisheries agreements, we have already voiced our intent to make full use of the possibilities granted to us by the Treaty and the interinstitutional framework agreement to participate in shaping fisheries agreements, with the right to full information on an equal footing with the Council.\nWe believe we should be involved in the process from the moment when the negotiating mandate is approved. The Fisheries Commission has thus decided to introduce a new procedure starting with the Mauritania Protocol, whereby we will submit an oral question and receive information on the future negotiations from the onset of the process. The procedure will also allow us to produce a draft resolution setting out our concerns on the agreement in issue - in this case, Mauritania - with the request that they be taken on board by the negotiators and ultimately become part of the final Protocol.\nThe agreement with Mauritania is crucial both for the country itself and for the European Union. For Mauritania, it represents 29% of the national budget; for the European Union, it is one of the three mixed agreements still in force, allowing the presence of several different modes of fishing in the c", "19.

No amendments have been proposed, so the agenda is adopted.\nHannes Swoboda\n(DE) Mr President, looking at the agenda and assuming that the debate on Georgia takes place today, we do not have any specific requests. However, if there are delays and the sitting overruns, with the result that the debate on Georgia cannot take place until tomorrow, then we would move that the debate on the social package be postponed until the September II part-session for, in my view, it will be impossible for us to debate the social package and Georgia in a single morning. I just wanted to give the House advance notice, as it were.\nPresident\nThank you, Mr Swoboda. There was no interpretation, I believe, particularly into English, if I have identified the colleagues concerned correctly. Let me repeat what Mr Swoboda has just said. Mr Swoboda said that, if the debate on today's Summit does not take place today but happens tomorrow, the debate on the social package should then be postponed until the September II part-session, as the time allocated for this debate will then be taken up talking about today's Summit. That is as I understand it. Do we agree on that? It seems we do. That brings us to the one-minute speeches on important political issues under Rule 144 of the Rules of Procedure.\n", "Programme of support for the European audiovisual sector (MEDIA 2007) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the recommendation for second reading by the Committee on Culture and Education on the Council common position for adopting a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the implementation of a programme of support for the European audiovisual sector (MEDIA 2007) (06233/2/2006 - C6-0271/2006 - 2004/0151 (COD)) (rapporteur: Mrs Hieronymi)\nRuth Hieronymi \nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, today finds us debating MEDIA 2007, the third generation support programme for the European film industry.\nI want to extend the warmest thanks to the members of the Committee on Culture and Education and to the advisory committees for their excellent cooperation, and particularly too to Commissioner Reding and her staff, who, together with this House, have tried to do everything they could to help the European audio-visual industry develop further and be a success.\nIt was exactly a year ago today, on 25 October 2005, that we in this House adopted this draft programme by a broad majority. We had wanted to adopt the programme in good time - and by that I mean early - so that it could be available to Europe's film-makers with effect from 1 January 2007, but the European Council was not, alas, far-sighted enough to stick to this timetable, and required us, in the first instance, to go through some difficult financial negotiations.\nThe MEDIA 2007 programme is structured in the same way as its successful predecessors, MEDIA and MEDIA PLUS, covering training, development and sales in the audiovisual sector, but not production, which is a matter for the Member States to deal with. What makes the MEDIA programme so extraordinarily important is the fact that the audio-visual sector is, as we are all aware, one of the fastest growing economic sectors not only in Europe, but throughout the world. If Europe wants to keep up, it has to get on the right track.\nThe MEDIA programme ", "2. Uzbekistan (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Uzbekistan.\nKatrin Saks\n(ET) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to recall what the French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, said in this very Chamber a couple of days ago: all those who have failed to respect our values, preferring instead to win contracts, have lost out on all fronts as a result. Where Uzbekistan and more broadly the whole of Central Asia are concerned, there is a danger that in assessing the region's energy resources the interests of individual countries will begin to prevail over our common values. Unfortunately, this is also apparent in the inability to agree on a motion for a resolution in support of the EPP and the UEN on the Council Decision suspending the visa ban on Uzbek officials for six months without a genuine change in the human rights situation.\nThe motion for a resolution also refers to the very critical human rights situation in Uzbekistan. To date, however, there has been an understanding in Uzbekistan, and I heard this with my own ears, that human rights are an internal matter for that country. We cannot agree to this approach and I urge you to support the first, more critical version of the motion for a resolution.\nElisabeth Jeggle  \nauthor. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a democratic institution, we cannot allow human rights to be trampled on anywhere in the world. However, we find it equally unacceptable if, within this very House, diplomatic relationships and interparliamentary cooperation between the EU and Uzbekistan are risked without giving it a thought. When I look at the motions for resolutions presented by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the left-wing groups, it is tantamount to a diplomatic demolition derby.\nIn Parliament's last resolution, dated October 2006, we committed ourselves to a constructive,", "One-minute speeches on matters of political importance\nPresident\nThe next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance pursuant to Rule 144.\nNickolay Mladenov\n(BG) Mr. Chairman, colleagues,\nThe natural disasters we witnessed in Europe this year come to prove the need for two substantial changes in the way in which we tackle these problems. In the first place, there is a need for the establishment of more flexible mechanisms to assist countries in the process of recovery after natural disasters. Secondly, these problems reveal the need for the establishment of integrated European rapid response forces to supplement the capacity of nations facing such disasters.\nThis year, my country Bulgaria suffered from both fires and floods. When massive fires had to be extinguished around one of the big cities, Stara Zagora, the government requested help from the Member States of the European Union but could not receive it because their capacity was busy. Instead, it received support from Russia on the basis of a bilateral agreement. That badly affected the image of the European Union in my country. Therefore I am asking all of you to appeal to the European Commission to make a thorough analysis and draft proposals for the establishment of joint European forces to assist the Member States in their response to disasters and accidents. Thank you.\nIoan Mircea Pa\u015fcu\nMr President, international terrorism represents the dark side of globalisation. Terrorists abuse the democratic freedoms granted by our countries, such as free travel, media coverage and citizens' rights, to attain their aims through fear and violence against innocent people.\nAddressing this problem calls for an effort to fully uncover and understand the intimate mechanisms of terrorism, including its religious, societal and even civilisational roots. We in the democratic states start with a handicap in this area. While we strive to save lives, terrorists want to cause as many casualties as possible", "Future of the car industry (debate) \nPresident\n- The next item is the Commission statement on the future of the car industry.\nG\u00fcnter Verheugen\nVice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is now the second occasion in just a few months on which we have come together in the Chamber to discuss the situation of the car industry in Europe. Regretfully, I have to say that the situation has worsened since our last debate.\nIn the last quarter of 2008, sales of new cars fell by 20% and car production by 29%. This negative trend is continuing in 2009. In January and February of this year, the sales figures dropped by 29% and 18% respectively. The fall would have been larger, if some Member States had not launched successful initiatives to stimulate demand. The crisis is not restricted to the European market. Exports to third countries have been reducing rapidly which means that we can expect a negative impact on the European balance of trade. Throughout the world the car industry is under pressure.\nThere is no prospect of improvement in the remaining months of this year. Overall production of cars and commercial vehicles in Europe is likely to fall by between 20-30%. This means that around 5 million fewer vehicles will be produced in Europe in 2009 than in 2007. The negative forecast applies in particular to commercial vehicles where a fall in production of 35% is expected.\nAs you know, the Commission has responded quickly to this situation. In October 2008, we made the first recommendations in the CARS 21 group for overcoming the crisis, including the involvement of the European Investment Bank and the scrappage incentives. At the beginning of January I met with EU finance ministers to agree on a common approach to the crisis. On 25 February the Commission presented a concept which was approved a few days later by the European Council and the Competitiveness Council.\nOur responses are aimed directly at the most important causes of this v", "Election of Vice-Presidents (first, second and third ballots) \nJ\u00f3zsef Sz\u00e1jer\nMr President, I would like to ask whether there is any minimum requirement for the vote.\nPresident\nMr Sz\u00e1jer, there is no minimum number: you can leave one person or two persons; it does not matter.\nPresident\nDear colleagues, allow me to say a few words at the beginning. During the break in the sitting it came to my attention that an Italian soldier was killed today in Afghanistan in the NATO-led mission there. His death comes after 15 British soldiers were killed in the past month. I think we always need to remember our men and women in the armed forces who are on missions abroad, often in dangerous situations, so that they know they are not forgotten.\n(Applause)\nV\u00e9ronique De Keyser\n(FR) Mr President, I am truly sorry but, for the sake of a clear vote, since we do not have a display and we have tried to keep up with your very quick delivery, please could you read out the names and the votes again a little more slowly?\nDaniel Cohn-Bendit\nMr President, put the numbers on the screen so that we can all see them. It is not very difficult.\n(Applause)\nBernd Posselt\n(DE) Mr President, I would urge you very strongly to ring the bell, as I see that a lot of Members from all groups are not here. Many people are under the impression that the vote is not due to start until 19.30. I would therefore ask you to ring the bell one more time.\n", "27. EU economic and trade relations with Mercosur (vote) \n- After the vote:\nZbigniew Zaleski\n(ES) Mr President, before moving on to the final item, on behalf of many Members of this Parliament I would like to express my profound sadness and discontent.\nBy not voting on a resolution on the death of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya today, this Parliament is, I believe, making a political and human mistake.\nI hope that the honourable Members, particularly the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, understand this message.\n", "Employment Policy Guidelines for Member States (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Van Lancker, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States PART V - C6-0031/2008 -.\nVladim\u00edr \u0160pidla\nMember of the Commission. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's December 2007 Strategic Report has sent a very positive message, which received the support of the European Council at its spring meeting in March 2008. The results of the Lisbon Strategy, in its 2005 renewed form, are already visible now at the end of the first three-year cycle. Economic growth and employment growth are impressive. Many indicators point to the fact that the structural reforms have started to produce results.\nAlthough all the Member States have been implementing reforms since 2005, some are doing better than others. A degree of fatigue in this area has become noticeable during the last year. However, Europe must not stop or slow down the pace. On the contrary, it is necessary to continue with reform implementation, preferably with even more gusto.\nThis is the idea behind the Commission's proposal on maintaining the key Integrated Guidelines - including the key employment guidelines - in their existing form until 2010. The Commission strongly believes that these key guidelines provide a proper framework for the present-day tasks of the European labour market, and that they serve their purpose. The European Council endorsed this at its spring meeting by opting for a general approach based on stability. Member States must be given the opportunity to finish the reforms they have begun, and they should also be given a timeframe within which the results of the reforms should show.\nThe Commission also found that it was necessary to propose changes, with emphasis on certain important tasks that would be tackled in the near fu climate change, energy, social dimension and flexicurity. The Commission ", "14. General arrangements for excise duty (\nBefore the vote on the amended proposal:\nAstrid Lulling\nMr President, I would ask all those Members who do not wish to revisit the days before 1992, that is to say, before the common market was established, to vote against the report, because what Parliament does with the votes it receives is shameful.\nThe report confuses everything: health, taxation and so on. Vote against the report; by doing so you will be voting for the Commission, which has made a good proposal.\n(Applause from the right)\nPresident\nIt seems to me that the opinion of the rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, is clear, regardless of whether it is shared. We will move on to a roll-call vote on the entire proposal, as amended.\nElisa Ferreira\n(PT) I want to protest about the statement made by Mrs Lulling who is trying to condition the vote of Members in this House. This does not make sense.\nThe interpretation being given is one that we do not share. It is only in this sense that I would ask Members, who know what this is about, who know that we defending other interests, namely public health interests and the interests of citizens and countries, to vote for the report.\n(Applause from the left)\nPresident\nI would like to remind Members that at this point in the conduct of the voting procedure there is no provision for debate. Under the Rules of Procedure, the rapporteur is entitled to express her own opinion and therefore I have obviously given her that right, and I did not know whether the next request to speak was on procedural grounds. Please excuse me, everyone, but there are other requests to speak and I intend not to grant them but to continue with the vote.\n", "Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting\nPresident\nThe Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nVan Velzen\nMr President, on page 18 of the Minutes, I am reported as having requested that Mr Imbeni adopt a stance now that he is in Cuba. However, what is at issue is the fact that Mr Imbeni will be making a statement on behalf of the European Parliament in compliance with the resolutions which the European Parliament has always adopted on Cuba. Parliament did this for the last time on 11 March 1999. Mr Imbeni, in fact, declared on 21 March to Agence Presse - and this what Mr Bar\u00f3n Crespo' s subsequent question, on page 19, addressed to me was about - that he did not intend to make a statement. This is not a private visit, but an official one by Mr Imbeni on behalf of the European Parliament. That is why we are urging him to make a statement on the human rights situation in Cuba. One can make wonderful statements in the European Parliament, but actually doing it in situ is a mark of greater courage.\n\nPresident\nMr van Velzen, I have taken note of that. I recall that the President told you yesterday that she would attend to that.\n\nSeguro\nMr President, I regret the fact that we are discussing this matter once again. Only yesterday, the chairman of my parliamentary group extolled the qualities and the sincerity of Mr Imbeni, and the way in which he has defended human rights, in Europe and in the rest of the world. I also regret the fact that, once again, an attack has been made on a Vice-President of this House when he is not here to defend himself. I hope that these words of mine will be recorded in the Minutes.\n(Applause from the left)\n\nPresident\nThank you, Mr Seguro. I do not intend to allow a debate on this subject. If there are any other requests to speak on this, I shall not accept them. The President made it clear yesterday what she intends to do. So that is the end of this item.\n\nBuitenweg\nMr President, I have no comment", "Basel II and revision of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD 4) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Karas, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on Basel II and revision of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD 4).\nOthmar Karas\nMadam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with this report on Basel III, the European Parliament has a clear position on the deliberations of the Basel Committee. We would like to draw attention to the unresolved questions and problems that Europe faces, and we are putting before the Commission a collection of demands for the drawing up of the draft directive. Although - and I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs in this regard - this report was adopted by 38 votes to 0 in the committee, I nevertheless feel a need, as rapporteur, to table six additional amendments, three of which relate to developments occurring in the meetings of the Basel Committee, in order to bring the report up-to-date, and three of which relate to the leverage ratio and to the liquidity standards.\nWe believe that it is not propitious to automatically incorporate the leverage ratio into Pillar 1 from 2018 but that there should instead be an evaluation process first. Secondly, there are a few unresolved issues in Basel in relation to the liquidity standards that need to be addressed to keep us up-to-date.\nI am a little bit amazed by the nine EU Member States in the Basel Committee, as they have allowed the process to be deemed completed despite the fact that we fail to see how there is a level playing field between the economic structure of the United States and the European economic and banking structure, and between classical retail and investment banking. Furthermore, we still do not have a definition of liquidity.\nThe economic crisis, of course, demonstrated that we need a change of framework. It is therefore right to get to grips with this issue and to bring forward proposals. However, the crisis als", "6. EU relations with the Gulf Cooperation Council (\nDominique Baudis\nMr President, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, in particular Mr Howitt, Mrs Brepoels, Mrs Brantner and Mrs J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki, with whom we prepared these amendments. Thanks to the amendments, we have a report that fully accounts for the events taking place in the Gulf, and which states very clearly Parliament's position on the repression afflicting that region.\nThe first amendment, 16th new citation, is as follows:\n'- having regard to the declarations by the High Representative of 10, 15 and 17 March, and the Council conclusions of 21 March on Bahrain and underlining in this context its full support for the freedom of expression and the right of citizens to peacefully demonstrate,'\nThis is the first amendment, and it is of course the English-language version, which has been distributed, that is deemed authentic.\nDominique Baudis\n(FR) The second amendment, recital A, is as follows:\n'Whereas current EU-GCC relations require constant reviewing and updating in view of recent important and rapidly unfolding developments on the ground, which are evolving rapidly, at the heart of which needs to be the pursuit of human rights and democracy.'\nDominique Baudis\n(FR) A new recital A bis:\n'A bis. Whereas demonstrators have expressed legitimate democratic aspirations in several GCC States; whereas the violent reaction of the authorities to the protests in Bahrain resulted in deaths, injuries and imprisonments; whereas Saudi, UAE and Kuwaiti troops have arrived in the country under the banner of the GCC to participate in the repression of demonstrators,'\nDominique Baudis\n(FR) In paragraph 7, after the first paragraph, the first indent should now read:\n'- ensure respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, with special regard to the freedom of speech and of assembly and the right to demonstrate peacefully, and to listen to and take into account the legitimate demands of protesters as well as to ensur", "26. Competition Policy 2005 (vote) \n- Ferreira report\n-Before the vote\nElisa Ferreira \nrapporteur. - (PT) Ladies and gentlemen, given that unforeseen transport difficulties prevented me and other MEPs from taking part in yesterday's debate, I should like to take this opportunity to thank the shadow rapporteurs for the atmosphere of cooperation and compromise that enabled us to reach a broad consensus.\nI should also like to thank the Commission services and, in particular, Mrs Kroes for her openness, the personal interest she has taken in this matter and her readiness to engage in dialogue. It has become particularly important today for there to be cooperation between the European institutions and for Parliament to be strongly involved, at a time when European competition policy covers strategic sectors such as energy and services of general economic interest, when it encompasses new areas such as the environment and when much competition has acquired a global dimension.\nConsequently, we must go on updating competition policy and must keep up the spirit of cooperation evident during the process of drafting this report, for the benefit of Europe's citizens.\n", "20. Annual report from the Council to Parliament on the main aspects and basic choices of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) in 2009 (\nGiles Chichester\nMr President, while you are enjoying yourself with your jokey and unorthodox approach to dealing with requests from the floor for check votes, may I humbly submit that, if you were to go a little slower, the interpretation could keep up with your announcements, and we could then vote in a more timely fashion. You are going a little fast and there is a little delay.\nPresident\nMr Chichester, what I will retain from this intervention is what I assume is your approval of my unorthodox ways.\nBefore the vote on paragraph 33, initial text:\nGabriele Albertini\nMr President, it is pointless for me to quote it. It is included in the explanation of vote: it begins with 'welcomes' and ends with 'manner'. You can read it in the text.\nGabriele Albertini\nMr President, in this case, too, the text is included in the voting list. I would just like to make one comment: the subject is the protest against the condemnation of demonstrators in Bahrain and criticism of that conduct.\nPresident\nMr Albertini, no, it is the oral amendment to Amendment 7 after paragraph 45.\nGabriele Albertini\nMr President, I made a mistake when reading the text. We deleted the name 'Macedonia' in order to avoid trampling on some people's sensibilities, including those, I believe, of the President.\nTherefore, only the expression 'former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia' was used. We deleted the name 'Macedonia'.\nNick Griffin\nMr President, I have to echo Mr Chichester's earlier intervention. We are being given by our interpreters the choice to vote 'no' after you have said '\u0395\u03b3\u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9' ['Adopted']. I am not aware that the ability to speak Greek is required of MEPs. If it is going to be, please tell us. If not, please slow down slightly.\nPresident\nThe answer to this question is that the ability to speak Greek is required by MEPs.\n(Applause and laughter)\nLis", "Modification of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 (the 'Single CMO Regulation') (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) - C7-0223/2009 -.\nMariann Fischer Boel\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, let me start by thanking you for allowing the urgent procedure to be applied to the two proposals that I hope will help the situation in the dairy market - one proposing that milk be included in the scope of Article 186, and one regarding the management of the buy-out scheme for quotas.\nThese proposals are the latest in a long series of dairy-oriented measures that we have adopted. I have taken note of your resolution of 17 September, and I hope you have noted that many of your recommendations are already covered in practice, covered by ongoing studies or will be covered by today's proposals.\nAs regards the long-term measures mentioned in your resolution, we have set up a high level group. The first meeting has taken place and we expect that the final paper will be delivered before the end of June next year.\nI am very happy to be able to say that the reality today in the dairy market is that prices are increasing and we are no longer seeing any buy-up into intervention because the market prices are better than the intervention prices.\nRegarding my proposal, Article 186 is an existing provision for a large number of products, but milk is not included. The recent price volatility that we saw, starting in 2007, has shown that it is, or it will be, necessary to include milk under this article, because this would then allow the Commission to take faster action.\nYesterday, in the Council of Agricultural Ministers and in COMAGRI, I also announced this EUR 280 million for dairy farmers. In order to be able to pay out this money quickly, I simply need the ", "13. 2007 progress report on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (\n- Before the vote\nHannes Swoboda\non behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, forgive me for rising too early a moment ago. I will be brief. We fully agree with the basic thrust of Mr Meijer's report; he has done a very good job. There is one sensitive issue and that is the question of the name. We want to make it easier for Macedonia to navigate through these rocky waters, which is why, between now and the next Strasbourg part-session, we want to work with the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur to find a solution so that we can take a vote during the next Strasbourg part-session. That means postponing the vote today.\nDaniel Cohn-Bendit\non behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr Swoboda, this is laughable! Everyone knows that we cannot find a solution within a week. This row has been going on for years, and the decision has to be taken: Macedonia is called Macedonia is called Macedonia. Greece has to accept that and then we will take a vote. It will make no difference whether we do so today or leave it for a week; Macedonia will still be called Macedonia.\n(Applause)\nMartin Schulz\n(DE) Mr President, I would like to vote in favour of Mr Swoboda's proposal, even if Mr Cohn-Bendit cannot imagine this working, perhaps because it does not sit easily with his style of political work. It is possible to achieve compromises within a matter of days, if you take time to seek these compromises, and that is precisely the purpose of Mr Swoboda's proposal. Yes, we can vote in the next part-session, but in the intervening period, we could find some kind of compromise for our resolution, given that we seem to be well on the way to doing so here in the House. We should take the time to do that, even if Mr Cohn-Bendit feels under pressure.\nErik Meijer\nrapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, although I do not fundamentally disagree with Mr Cohn-Bendit regarding the name, I think that Mr Swoboda's proposal should be ", "Welcome\nPresident\n- Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to inform you that, within the framework of the inter-parliamentary sessions, a delegation from the Moroccan Parliament, led by the Speaker of the Parliament, Mr Abdel Wahid Al-Radi, and the President of the Chamber of Councillors, Mr Mohamed Sheikh Biadillah, is currently on a working visit to the European Parliament, the aim of which is the inaugural meeting of the EU-Morocco Joint Parliamentary Committee. I would like to extend a very warm welcome to all members of this delegation. The co-presidents of this first joint body between our assembly and one of the Maghreb countries are Mrs Mbarka Bouaida, Chair of the Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, National Defence and Islamic Affairs, and Mr Panzeri, Member of the European Parliament.\nThe European Parliament is delighted to state that relations between the EU and Morocco are excellent, as evidenced by the adoption of the joint document establishing the advanced status of Morocco. This new framework for dialogue further strengthens relations with the delegations of the European Parliament for relations with the Maghreb countries, and makes it possible to broaden talks between the EU and Morocco on matters of common interest. I hope and trust that the meeting which took place in the European Parliament was fruitful and that it will actively contribute towards bringing the two parliaments closer together.\n", "Presentation of the programme of the Slovenian Presidency (debate) \nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, today is a very special day. It is a special day because for the first time in the history of the European Union the representative, the Prime Minister of this country, namely Slovenia, has the Presidency of the European Union. Slovenia is a country that joined the European Union on 1 May 2004 along with nine other countries. And it is the first time that one of the former communist countries now living according to the basic principles of freedom, democracy and parliamentarianism, namely Slovenia, has the Presidency of the European Union. I therefore warmly welcome the President-in-Office of the Council, the Prime Minister of Slovenia, Janez Jan\u0161a. Welcome to the European Parliament!\n(Applause)\nToday is also special for another reason, however, and I therefore extend a particularly warm welcome to the President of the European Commission, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Dur\u00e3o Barroso, because it is exactly 50 years ago that the first President of the European Commission, Walter Hallstein, convened his first Commission. The 50th anniversary of the European Commission is another event for us to celebrate. And so I also send the Commission, as an exception in this rather solemn context, all good wishes for this special birthday.\n(Applause)\nLadies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure to listen to the report of the President-in-Office of the Council.\nJanez Jan\u0161a\nPresident of the Council. - (SL) It is my honour and pleasure to be with you here today, and indeed also a matter of pride. I feel pride as a Slovene whose country is the first of the new EU Member States to be entrusted with the presidency of the European Council and also as a European whose Union is entering 2008 with a signed Lisbon Treaty and an enlarged Eurozone and Schengen area.\nI assure you that in the months leading up summer I will be delighted, if you invite me, to come here more often, and certainly after each meeting of the E", "12. Integrated pollution prevention and control: industrial emissions, titanium dioxide industry, use of organic solvents, incineration of waste, large combustion plants (\nBefore the vote:\nGraham Watson\non behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, if I understood you correctly, you are indicating that the presidency does wish to apply the recast procedure to the Krahmer report today and the Cashman report. In that case, my group requests that we delay the vote until tomorrow so that we can study the implications of this.\nGuido Sacconi\nMr President, as I said earlier, I am in favour of this proposal, although I would like to point out that if amendments had not been tabled that go somewhat beyond what was adopted on the basis of a general compromise within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, this problem would not have arisen, since the compromise amendments were completely in keeping with the nature of this revision, namely a recast. If this had been the case, then we could have voted today, but we accept the deferral as it makes sense.\nCaroline Jackson\non behalf of the PPE-DE Group. -Mr President, it behoves Mr Watson, if he is making a suggestion that we should consider the recast implications, to explain to us now what the recast implications are. He might like to have a word with Mr Corbett before answering.\nI am fairly relaxed about this, but it would be much more sensible, since we are teed up to vote on this and we are unlikely to change our opinion on the actual voting - plus, minus or abstention - in the light of the recast procedures, to vote now when we have the time rather than hurry and add this vote to the list tomorrow when we have a lot of other things to do. Therefore, I am opposed to moving it.\nHolger Krahmer\nMr President, I am very pleased that the President has finally given the floor to the rapporteur. I am also quite surprised!\nAt this time, we are still getting used to the recast rules. I would, however, like to dr", "2. Kazakhstan: the case of Yevgeny Zhovtis\nPresident\nI have received five motions for a resolution concerning Kazakhstan: the Yevgeny Zhovtis case (Rule 122).\nHeidi Hautala\nauthor. - (FI) Mr President, I would like to make a final comment on the debate we have just had and say that, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, I recently sent a letter to the Conference of Committee Chairs, asking it to consider bringing these discussions forward, so that Parliament may be fully attended and also so that the Council can have a more prominent role here in the discussion. I hope that my fellow Members in the various groups will discuss this matter with their groups' chairmen, as Parliament's authority is continually being gnawed away at because there are so few of us here at any one time.\nNow let us turn to the Zhovtis case. Kazakhstan is an important Central Asian country, and it will assume the Chairmanship of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe next year. It is therefore not a matter of indifference how crimes are judged in a country that will be at the head of the democratic aspirations of all countries over a vast area of Europe. Accordingly, we should focus attention on the case of human rights defender Yevgeny Zhovtis. He was found guilty of manslaughter in very suspicious circumstances and sentenced to four years in an open prison for running over a pedestrian in July this year.\nWe have to take into account the fact that the OSCE has been wondering whether the procedure to which Zhovtis was subjected was possibly in violation of the principle of a fair trial, which is guaranteed in Kazakhstan's constitution. The European Parliament also needs to keep this debate going with the Council and the Commission, so that they might raise the issue of this case and demand a fair trial.\nMr President, the European Parliament can have a powerful influence on the extent to which the countries of Central Asia endorse the principle of the rule of law by", "Future global architecture of financial markets and EU economic recovery plan (debate) \nPresident\nWe welcome students from the European University of Rome who are present in the gallery.\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council and Commission on the future global architecture of financial markets and EU economic recovery plan - B6-0487/2008) and - B6-0488/2008).\nPervenche Ber\u00e8s\nMr President, Mr Alumnia, Mr Novelli, Mr Barroso, a short while ago, we were told that the time had come for the Commission to nudge Member States. If such is the Commission's strategy, you are welcome here in Parliament, and you will have our full support in the implementation of such a strategy.\nFor us, the current problem resides in the degree of cooperation between Member States. Too often, what we see is a realisation of the urgency of the situation and a juxtaposition of national solutions that are then dressed up as a European solution. We think that we must proceed differently if we wish to make better use of our resources.\nWith regard to the international financial architecture, the G20 met and defined future deadlines. When I look at the conclusions of the Ecofin Council, as adopted yesterday, one thing strikes me, which is that I do not see any mandate for the Commission in its conclusions. I therefore would like the Council to tell me how it intends to implement its proposals, in particular with regard to combating the non-cooperative nature of certain jurisdictions and defining the role of the IMF in relation to other international financial institutions.\nI would also like the Council and the Commission to tell us what are the next stages in the light of the timetable adopted, and under what conditions might Parliament become involved in these debates, since I believe that this is how we must proceed if we want a European dynamic.\nWith regard to the recovery plan, a figure of 1.5% was flagged up. Compared to the figures circulating previously, this must be ", "Question Time (Commission) \nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B6-0462/2008).\nThe following questions are addressed to the Commission.\nPart one\n\nSubject: Eurozone budget deficit limits\nUnder the rules of the European Union's Stability and Growth Pact, eurozone countries should remain inside a budget deficit limit of 3% of GDP.\nCan the Commission provide an up-to-date assessment of current adherence to the rules?\nDoes the Commission consider current fiscal rules to be flexible enough to allow governments to react to economic trouble but strict enough to ensure the sustainability of public finances?\nWhat, if any, are the circumstances in which eurozone countries may be permitted to exceed the 3% budget deficit?\nAndris Piebalgs\nMember of the Commission. - The subject of the first question is covered in detail in the Commission's 2008 report on public finances in the EMU. The only significant budgetary development which is not covered there is the recent launch of the excessive-deficit procedure for the United Kingdom.\nGiven that the budget deficit in the UK is expected by the Commission to exceed the 3% reference value in both fiscal years 2008-2009 and 2009-2010, in accordance with Article 104(6) of the Treaty, the Council has decided this year that an excessive deficit does exist in the United Kingdom. On the same occasion, in accordance with Article 104(7) of the Treaty, the Council set a deadline of one year for the correction of this excessive deficit.\nMore generally, in line with its mandate under the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact, the Commission is continuously monitoring the economic and budgetary development in Member States and stands ready to activate the instruments of budgetary surveillance where necessary.\nThe answer to the second question is positive, particularly with reference to the corrective arm. Since the 2005 reform, excessive deficits have been corrected, with currently only the UK and Hungary subject to the excessive-deficit pr", "Situation in Iran (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the delivery of statements on the situation in Iran by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and by the Commission.\nI warmly welcome the High Representative, Javier Solana. Mr Solana, the floor is yours.\nJavier Solana\nHigh Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. - Mr President, I do not want to interfere in the debate which is taking place, but I take the floor at your invitation. Let me start by thanking you for the invitation today. It is the first time that I have spoken before Parliament in the year 2008. We are all sure that 2008 is going to be very exciting, to say the least. I want to continue with a deeper cooperation with Parliament, with yourself and with the distinguished Members of this Chamber.\nToday we have a very important debate - a debate on an issue that is one of the most important issues on the agenda of the international community. I would like to make a short statement about it and spend the time necessary to see whether we can together understand - and not only understand but make some progress on the solution of - this very complicated issue that is at the top of the international agenda today.\nLet me start by making a few remarks. Iran is a key country in the Middle East. It is important in strategic terms, and is also important as a regional actor. We would like, therefore, to have a constructive relationship with Iran; but, as you know, there are many difficulties with this.\nIran is a very vibrant society, full of talented people. It has an exceptionally high proportion of women graduates. Persian is one of the major languages on the internet, especially for blogs, as young people seek a means of self-expression.\nThe political scene in Iran - as you well know - is of great interest these days. There are elements of democracy there which are not present in other countries of the Middle East, though the election process still leaves much to", "Promotion of clean road transport vehicles (debate)\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the report by Dan J\u00f8rgensen, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the revised proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the promotion of clean and energy-efficient road transport vehicles.\nDan J\u00f8rgensen\nrapporteur. - (DA) Madam President, every day there are Europeans who become ill because of air pollution. Every day there are Europeans who die because of air pollution from traffic in Europe. We also know that we are facing extreme climate changes, which are not least due to the fact that too much fuel is being used by the transport sector. For those two reasons, this is extremely important legislation that we are debating in the House this afternoon. For those two reasons also, this is an extremely important compromise that we have successfully negotiated between Parliament and the Council of Ministers and that we shall, I hope, adopt tomorrow.\nWhat we would be adopting is an obligation on the part of European authorities to play a much greater role in combating air pollution. What we are adopting is an obligation for authorities to take account of more than the price in pounds and pence or euros and cents when making a decision to purchase a vehicle, whether it be a refuse collection lorry, bus or other vehicle they use to carry out public sector tasks. Account must also be taken of the costs to health, the environment and the climate of the fact that vehicles emit different types of particles and that, in burning fossil fuels, they cause increased pollution and thus more global warming.\nWe are not compelling local authorities to choose the most environmentally friendly solution, but we are forcing them to take account of the consequences in terms of health and the environment when making their calculations. We are also creating openness and transparency in connection with the decisions made. I am", "Situation in Tibet (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Tibet.\nFor many years now the European Parliament has resolutely championed the cause of human rights in Tibet. In numerous resolutions we have called for a constructive dialogue between the Chinese leadership and the Dalai Lama and respect for the human rights of the Tibetan people.\nIn doing so, we are guided by our principles and values, of which fundamental rights are an integral part: the dignity of each and every individual, and the realisation of their own and their ethnic community's cultural and religious identity are the values we espouse.\nThe events in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and in other Chinese cities since 10 March this year are deeply disturbing. We condemn every form of violence and the disproportionate use of the military and police.\n(Applause)\nWe condemn the deaths of people who were acting peacefully. We declare our solidarity with the Dalai Lama, who is a symbol of peace, understanding and compromise. We cannot allow a situation in which the Dalai Lama's name is linked with terrorism.\n(Applause)\nWe cannot allow the demonisation of the Dalai Lama. On a personal note, may I say that whenever I have met the Dalai Lama, the impression that I have always gained is of a person with a profound commitment to peace, reconciliation and human rights. I have every confidence and trust in the Dalai Lama and wish to convey my great respect and appreciation to him. I therefore call on those in power in Beijing to negotiate with the Dalai Lama and, while upholding the territorial integrity of China, to reach an understanding that respects and guarantees the cultural and religious identity of the Tibetan people.\nThe Dalai Lama has accepted our invitation to address the European Parliament as part of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, and this has been scheduled for the month of December.\nHowever, I hope you will agree that in light of re", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nWynn\nMr President, concerning the voting list and the contentious paragraph 4c of the IGC debate, in our group I argued vigorously that we should be voting for this. However, when it came to the vote, it was one of those embarrassing moments when Mr Harrison, Mr Donnelly and myself voted against when should have voted for. To correct that we gave a statement in writing to the secretariat asking that it be corrected to show that we had voted for 4c. In the record it still shows that we voted against and I am asking if it could be corrected.\n\nPresident\nI would refer you to page 14 of the English Minutes where it says Mr Wynn, Mr Donnelly, Mr Harrison and Mr Elchlepp had intended to vote in favour.\n\nMarset Campos\nMr President, I refer to a mistake in the Spanish version of the joint motion on the free movement of goods in the European Union. My name and that of Mr Alonso Puerta and Mr Jov\u00e9 should have been included as signatories to the motion on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, as in the other versions.\n\nPresident\nWe will have it checked out and get it corrected.\n\nMcMahon\nOn Tuesday I raised the matter of Norwegian salmon and the need for the Commission to make a statement to this House. As a delegation from the Norwegian Parliament is here today...\n\nPresident\nMr McMahon, we are discussing Wednesday's Minutes. Tuesday's Minutes were approved, as is usual, the following day.\n\nImaz San Miguel\nMr President, I would like a mistake in today's agenda to be corrected.\nIn the joint motion on the disruption of the internal market (B4-0488/97), my name is missing. By some error, the list of signatories to that joint motion omits my name. Please could it be added.\n\nPresident\nWe will make sure that is corrected.\n\nFord\nMr President, you have drawn our attention to page 14 of the Minutes. I notice that 40 Members had to correct their votes yesterday. Is this a failure of", "Protection and conservation of the marine environment: Marine Strategy Directive (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Framework for Community Action in the field of Marine Environmental Policy (Marine Strategy Framework Directive) [09388/2/2007 - C6-0261/2007 - (Rapporteur: Marie-No\u00eblle Lienemann).\nMarie-No\u00eblle Lienemann\nrapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive that Parliament should adopt at its second reading is extremely important because it is the first directive that forces Member States to have an environmental strategy to restore the seas and oceans to a good ecological status. When we looked at it, at its first reading, we stressed its importance given that recent scientific reports show that the survival of fish stocks and the biodiversity of the seas and oceans are under particular threat. Some people are even saying that in fifty years' time there will be no more fish. Furthermore, the oceans play a fundamental role in regulating the climate and by polluting them we are in danger of diminishing this regulating function and accentuating the negative effects of climate change. It was therefore urgent and necessary for the European Union, having adopted the water framework directive, particularly regarding freshwater, to swiftly address the issue of seawater.\nAt its first reading, we demonstrated our willingness to improve the existing text. First I will go over the structural points of this directive and the existing texts. The first aim is to restore our seas and oceans to a good ecological status. The second is to define the necessary steps to be taken by each Member State: firstly, to collaborate within Marine Regions or Sub-Regions; then to define the state of the water and of biodi", "Explanations of vote\n- Oral explanations of vote:\nNikolaos Chountis\n(EL) Mr President, I should like to explain my vote on the visa rights of citizens of the Western Balkans. The unwavering view of the left wing is that everyone has the right to move and travel freely; therefore, every citizen should have the right to travel to and enter the European Union.\nWhereas, therefore, I agree that visa restrictions should be lifted for citizens of the Western Balkans, I voted against the resolution because the way in which it raises the issue and refers to Kosovo essentially constitutes de facto confirmation of its unilateral recognition as an independent state.\nIn my opinion, this is in breach of the UN founding charter and Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999). This is a practice which slips in a direction which does not promote the peaceful resolution of differences, security or stability in the area.\nFrancisco Jos\u00e9 Mill\u00e1n Mon\n(ES) Mr President, with regard to the Fajon report, on behalf of the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to point out that, although we voted for the report, we do not agree with recital 2a, added by Amendment 4, which states that the Commission 'should start a visa dialogue with Kosovo with a view to establishing a roadmap for visa facilitation and liberalisation similar to those established with Western Balkan countries'.\nIn my delegation's view, Kosovo cannot be put on the same footing as the Western Balkan countries. I would point out that Kosovo has not been recognised by the Spanish authorities or by any other Member States.\nSince the amendment I have mentioned was voted on in block voting with many other amendments, we were not able to vote against it, but we would like it placed on the record that we are not in agreement with its content.\nAnna Maria Corazza Bildt\nMr President, I just wanted to say that we should stress that the joint declaration is really a great success. It i", "Implementation of the social legislation relating to road transport (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Alejandro Cercas, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the implementation of social legislation relating to road transport.\nAlejandro Cercas\nMr President, Commissioner, thank you for being here. As you are aware, in March 2002, the Council and Parliament came to an agreement, through conciliation, on Directive 2002/15/EC, which establishes the requirements that have to be fulfilled for the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities, in order to ensure their health and safety, to ensure road safety and also to align conditions of competition for all enterprises. It included all types of work, not only driving but also the physical work that these drivers sometimes do in loading and unloading or cleaning the vehicles.\nThat conciliation procedure resolved the most significant problem, which was whether or not self-employed workers should be included, and the parties agreed together, with the support of the Commission, that self-employed workers would be included, in order to put an end, once and for all, to the problems of double legislation, the double standards applied to self-employed drivers and employed drivers.\nThe lack of common regulation raised huge problems: these self-employed workers were working extremely long days, causing problems for their personal lives and for road safety, and also because drivers were posing as self-employed and undermining the rules of fair competition.\nIt was therefore a great achievement to put an end once and for all, with a reasonable transition period, to this double legislation, and in 2002, the Commission, the Council and Parliament all reached the conclusion that it was the most rational and logical step.\nWe have produced this own-initiative report, with the support of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Transport", "15. Green Paper: Diplomatic and consular protection of Union citizens (vote) \n- Report: Ioannis Varvitsiotis\n- Before the vote:\nIoannis Varvitsiotis\nrapporteur. - (EL) Madam President, I feel I must thank the three shadow rapporteurs, Mrs Kaufmann, Mr Moreno S\u00e1nchez and Mr Guardans Camb\u00f3, for the close and extensive cooperation we have had, and all the Members of the Commission for accepting my arguments.\nThe large majority by which the Commission accepted my report shows that the Member States must lay aside their petty objections and take action soon, so that this Green Paper can become a reality, a legislative instrument which will help all the citizens of the Union.\n", "Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question by Louis Michel, Charles Goerens, Antonyia Parvanova, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Ries, Olle Schmidt, Maria Da Gra\u00e7a Carvalho, Nessa Childers, Marc Tarabella, Bart Staes and Marina Yannakoudakis on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, to the Commission on the Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative -B7-0006/2011).\nCharles Goerens\nMadam President, I am happy to be able to lend my support to a pan-European project that is very ambitious both for the European Union and for developing countries, and which is aimed at eliminating tuberculosis by means of a vaccination programme.\nLet us remember that more than 1.7 million people died from tuberculosis in 2009. The cost in terms of human life is some 4 700 people per day. Add to this the annual economic losses, which are estimated at more than USD 50 billion for Africa alone. If, based on this, we were to reduce tuberculosis to a problem typical of developing countries, we should be greatly deceiving ourselves.\nIn fact, the cases reported in the United Kingdom and Ireland during the summer of 2010 remind us that the disease is here in our countries, not to mention the ravages caused by the same disease in the east of our continent, particularly in Russia and Moldova. The Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative (TBVI) is an initiative that aims to create effective vaccines with a view to protect developing countries at an affordable price. With this in mind, I should like, if I may, to make the following comments.\nFirst, health does not have a price but it has a cost. While access to healthcare must be universal, the ability to pay remains in itself limited to the industrialised nations. That being the case, it is important to spread the costs broadly. Clearly, patients in the North, that is to say in the industrialised countries, must pay a high price, otherwise the sources of funding for research will dry up quickly en", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nPosselt\nMadam President, yesterday an explanation of vote by Mr Dell'Alba was recorded, two aspects of which were not an explanation of vote. Firstly, it contained personal insults that I must reject, for he accused me of falsifying history, and secondly he called on the President to act contrary to the Rules, namely to delete passages from the explanatory statement in my report. According to our Rules of Procedure, however, the rapporteur is solely responsible for the content of an explanatory statement. It can no more be deleted than can passages from a speech. This could only be done under some kind of Orwellian Ministry of Truth, and the Committee on External Economic Relations has unanimously rejected this notion in a letter to the President.\n\nPresident\nThat has been noted, Mr Posselt. But we really must get on with approving the Minutes.\nAre there any other comments on the Minutes?\n(Parliament approved the Minutes)\n\nVotes\nWijsenbeek\nHave you noted, Madam President, that our group abstained because the Farthofer report as such does nothing to change the monopoly situations enjoyed by all the railway companies in the Member States?\n\nPresident\nThis is not really the time for explanations of vote, but we did hear what you said.\n\nCorreia\nI voted for the proposal for a regulation which will allow the renewal, until the end of 1997, of the regulations applying to importation into Madeira, the Azores and the Canary Islands of cattle for fattening and local consumption, certain fresh or frozen pork or meat-based products, and seed potato supplies.\nI should point out that the special regime which has now been extended consists in exemption from import duties and the granting of aid for the above-mentioned products coming from the rest of the European Community. This special regime is justified because these supplies meet the needs of these particular regi", "\nBerthu\nMr President, I wish to comment on this morning' s agenda, which, as you know, is particularly lean, even though extremely important events are taking place in Europe and it is most striking that we have held an entire part-session without having a single debate on the single currency.\nLast week, on 24 September, an extremely important referendum was held, in which the Danes rejected the single currency. Yesterday, the European Central Bank raised its intervention rates by a quarter of a point, which led to a further fall in the euro' s value. There are two conclusions to be drawn here. Firstly, the public will never take any interest in our debates if Parliament persists in side-stepping discussions on every important issue. Secondly, the euro is an artificial currency and it would be a disaster to make a complete changeover to the euro in the present circumstances.\n\nR\u00fcbig\nMr President, I just wanted to draw attention to the huge pile of documents we needed for voting this week. I would like to congratulate the honourable Members. We have all been very industrious.\n(Laughter, applause)\n\nPresident\nThank you, Mr R\u00fcbig.\n\nLoans for projects in Croatia\nPresident\nThe next item is the report (A5-0237/2000) by Mr Sepp\u00e4nen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council Decision amending Decision 2000/24/EC so as to extend the Community guarantee granted to the European Investment Bank to cover loans for projects in Croatia (COM(2000) 289 - C5-0336/2000 - 2000/0122(CNS)).\n\nSepp\u00e4nen\nMr President, the European Investment Bank grants loans to non-EU countries, guaranteed by the European Union. The bank guarantees individual loans freely in accordance with its own criteria and not the precise guidelines laid down by the EU.\nHowever, the Union has fixed a ceiling for the loans it guarantees. The loans are not guaranteed one hundred percent and the Council decided in December 1999 to guarantee just 65% of the final total for loans for the period 2000", "Statement by the President\nPresident\nYesterday afternoon, an earthquake struck the Spanish province of Murcia. At least seven people were killed. Many were injured. Three hours ago, Mr Mart\u00ednez Mart\u00ednez made a statement about this. On behalf of the European Parliament, I extend condolences to the families of the victims. We wish all those who have been injured a rapid return to health. We also admire the immediate reaction and effort of the people of the province, who are helping in the rescue operation. I am just sending a letter of condolence to the Spanish authorities on this matter.\nCristina Guti\u00e9rrez-Cortines\n(ES) Mr President, thank you very much for your compassionate and supportive words.\nThe Lorca tragedy is becoming clear. At the moment, we know that eight people have died, among them two pregnant women and a twelve year-old boy, more than 250 have been injured and 80% of houses are affected. That is to say, from now on and for the moment, many Lorca citizens will be homeless. A large portion of Lorca citizens have also lost their places of work and with them have gone their hopes, expectations and opportunities.\nLorca is a city of 70 000 inhabitants, of whom 20% are immigrants that the city has received, taken in and been able to give a new life with new meaning. I know that together, the old and new residents of Lorca, with help from the institutions and from everybody, will be able to begin a new journey in their lives. I also have to say and call on the European Union not to leave anyone behind and to be able to help those affected, recognise their pain and stand by their side, opening their arms and offering opportunities.\nI would like to thank you all very much and to ask for a minute's silence.\n(Applause)\nPresident\nI will ask everyone to rise. We will now observe a minute's silence.\n", "Radio Spectrum (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Hall, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, entitled 'Towards a European policy on the radio spectrum'.\nFiona Hall \nrapporteur. - Madam President, firstly I would like to thank all the people who shared their knowledge and expertise with me when I was preparing this report. I would particularly like to thank the Commission for its generous help, as well as my colleagues, the shadows from the other groups, for their very constructive and cooperative suggestions.\nThe basic theme of the report is that the current method of managing radio spectrum is no longer adequate in the face of constantly emerging new technologies. These new technologies need to make use of radio spectrum, but the quantity of radio spectrum will always be limited simply by the laws of physics, so we have to find ways of making sure that this precious resource is used as efficiently as possible.\nPolicy on radio spectrum may sound like an obscure matter of no interest to the citizen on the street, but the end result of that policy is of fundamental interest because it is a question of jobs and economic growth. If we fail to reform our approach to radio spectrum, we are failing European industry, which is poised to become a global leader in communications technology. All the innovation that the industry is coming forward with will fail to develop properly if no spectrum is available and if the industry is blocked from operating across the European market of 500 million people.\nThe Lisbon Agenda is the driving force behind the new approach to spectrum. But there is also the need for Europe to be forward looking in the way it makes services of public and general interest available. I will come back to that in a minute.\nFirst, I should like to say a few words about the changes proposed. At present, spectrum is managed on an administrative command and control model whereby certain frequencies are allocated to cer", "Situation in the Korean Peninsula (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the situation in the Korean Peninsula.\nCatherine Ashton\nVice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, this debate on Korea is most timely. I am aware that the parliamentary delegation has just come back from a visit. The Republic of Korea is a key, like-minded partner in an increasingly important part of the world. It is also an emerging global player, hosting the G20 summit in November.\nOur bilateral relationship is developing swiftly. We recently completed negotiations on two linked agreements: an ambitious and comprehensive free trade agreement and an updated framework agreement. The framework agreement, which we signed last month, provides a basis for closer cooperation on major political issues such as human rights, non-proliferation, counter-terrorism, climate change and energy security.\nOur relations with North Korea are of a different character. With respect to the nuclear issue, which is very serious, the EU fully supports the Six-Party Talks. We have made it clear that progress on denuclearisation is a 'pre-condition' for improving wider relations and, of course, we are implementing the sanctions under UN Security Council resolutions 1718 and 1874 in a robust manner.\nIn the present circumstances, we are not providing normal development aid, but we do offer humanitarian-type assistance, targeting vulnerable areas and groups, and we use our bilateral dialogue to press on all issues of concern. On human rights, where the situation is dramatic, the EU has initiated strong international condemnation, including at the UN. We have stated that improvements on these issues would lead to improved bilateral relations. So far, the response has not been what we have hoped for - but I still be", "Type-approval of hydrogen powered motor vehicles (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Anja Weisgerber, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on type-approval of hydrogen powered motor vehicles and amending Directive 2007/46/EC - C6-0342/2007 -.\nG\u00fcnter Verheugen\nVice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, once again, we are talking about the car of the future - a topic that the European Parliament has already dealt with intensively this week in another connection.\nToday we are discussing a technical opportunity that may be able to help us solve the environmental problems caused by vehicles. Let me repeat: it is something that may be able to help us. We do not know whether its potential can be implemented on a large scale, but we should make the most of the opportunity. That is what this is all about.\nWe all agree that sustainable mobility will be one of the key challenges that we will have to tackle in the years to come. We do not want to restrict the right of European citizens to individual mobility. On the other hand, there can be no doubt that this right to individual mobility - plainly speaking, the right to drive cars, to own and use a car - must be exercised in such a way that it does not destroy our environment, and that means that we need cars that do not harm the environment.\nA comment in passing: it is not just because of the state of the environment that this is essential and urgent; it is also becoming increasingly important in economic terms. The traditional internal combustion engine is out of date because fuel consumption is so high. We must do everything possible to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels wherever it occurs.\nAgainst this background, the question arises of whether we can facilitate the development of hydrogen powered vehicles. That is the idea that led to the suggestion mad", "Question Hour with the President of the Commission\nPresident\nThe next item is the Question Hour with the President of the Commission.\nFree questions\nPaulo Rangel\nVice-Chairman of the PPE Group. - (PT) Mr President, President of the Commission, I would like to begin this first debate by congratulating you on this new instrument of political oversight and what it means for the advancement and development of parliamentary democracy in Europe. The winners in this will be Europe's citizens, through their representatives.\nBearing in mind the latest developments - the Irish referendum, ratification by Poland and the recent statements by the President of the Czech Republic - I ask what your assessment is of the process for the Treaty of Lisbon to come into force. Has the President of the Commission been taking any action? What is your projected date for the Treaty to come into force and, furthermore, with this provisional date in mind, has the Commission taken any steps as yet towards the transition of the treaties - from the Treaty of Nice to the Treaty of Lisbon - or are we still in a state of expectation, so to speak; are we waiting to see what will happen?\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso\nFirstly, Mr Rangel, thank you for your greetings. I am very pleased to find this procedure now in the European Parliament. We also have it in Portugal, and I was involved in it both as leader of the opposition and as Prime Minister, and so I hope that this will prove to be a good opportunity for discussion with the honourable Members.\nIn response to the specific question asked, to me the matter is obvious: all the countries have already approved the Treaty of Lisbon in democratic terms. Ireland did it by referendum, the other countries through parliament. The process of ratification is still ongoing in the Czech Republic. We are awaiting the completion of the process in the Constitutional Court, but once that process is finished, we will have completed the ratification process definitively, because", "Trade in raw materials and commodities (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Holm, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on trade in raw materials and commodities.\nJens Holm\nrapporteur. - (SV) Ladies and gentlemen, first a big thank you to all the shadow rapporteurs for their close cooperation.\nWe have all seen pictures of the scenes precipitated by the recent food shortages. Agricultural prices, not least for foods, have shot up over a very short period. This has come as a mortal blow to many developing countries which are heavily dependent on food imports and were already living on the margins. Let us hope that this report on international trade in raw materials will help to remedy some of these problems. After all we have committed ourselves to eradicating hunger and poverty in signing up to the so-called Millennium Goals. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon recently warned that the increased food prices were jeopardising the most important objective of the Millennium Goals, namely to halve poverty in the world. So it is high time that urgent measures were taken.\nIn particular, the recent food crisis has shown that food is not just any raw material. If such an elementary requirement as to ensure that people are fed cannot even be met, the rhetoric on development is not worth much. We should therefore be careful in making food an international trade commodity like any other. The world's developing countries have even been forced to deregulate their food policy and switch from production for national needs to export production. This is the policy of the IMF, the World Bank, the USA and the EU as well, which have all imposed these demands. By abolishing protective tariffs and subsidies many developing countries have become extremely vulnerable to heavy fluctuations in food and raw material prices. Take Haiti, for example, which was previously self-sufficient in rice. In 1995 the International Monetary Fund forced that country to", "Report on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions during the year 2006 (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Carlos Jos\u00e9 Iturgaiz Angulo, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions during the year 2006.\nStavros Dimas\nMadam President, ladies and gentlemen, the work of the Committee on Petitions is an admirable resource enabling us to gain an in-depth understanding of the problems and complaints of citizens regarding European affairs.\nWhile these cover a wide range of policy areas, they frequently touch up on land-planning and environmental issues. They essentially involve all Member States and encompass broad sections of civil society, from individual citizens to multinational NGOs.\nYour rapporteur rightly, I think, underlines the importance of the work entailed in the 1 000 or more petitions you receive each year. There are three aspects of the report and the resolution that I should like to mention.\nThe first of these is a recent development: the visits the Commission makes to places where a particular problem has arisen. These visits may have considerable media impact and will undoubtedly give your work a higher profile. In addition to being covered by the press and the media generally, these missions engender very detailed reports which, in my opinion, are of high quality. I believe these are important records of your activity and certainly deserve wide publicity. Those of you who managed to hear the radio programmes last week about the activity of the Committee on Petitions will have understood how important it is that you should give those submitting petitions a personal hearing in the presence of all the necessary experts. This represents a large investment in time and resources, but I am sure it would be worthwhile.\nThe second point I should like to emphasise has always been a favourite in these debates: the coexistence or even duplication of a petition and complaint, possibly giving rise t", "Question Time (Commission) \nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B7-0407/2011).\nThe following questions are addressed to the Commission.\nPart one\nSubject: Quality food schemes\nIn February 2011, the Commission registered its 1 000th quality food name. It is clear, however, that the number of applications to register under the protected geographical indication (PGI), protected designation of origin (PDO) and traditional specialities guaranteed (TSG) quality food schemes varies considerably from one Member State to another. Why does the Commission think there are such disparities between Member States? Can the Commission comment on the views expressed by some food producers that the registration process is long and bureaucratic and therefore discourages applicants? How can the registration process be made more user-friendly?\nCan the Commission provide information on consumer awareness of the quality food schemes? How can recognition of the PDO, PGI and TSG labels be improved and made more relevant to consumers, in particular, in Member States that have few registered products?\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Andor\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, when the European system of protected designations of origin (PDOs), protected geographical indications (PGIs) and traditional specialities guaranteed (TSGs) was set up, equivalent systems already existed in some Member States.\nThe concept of geographical indications was thus familiar and names had already been registered at national level. This explains why there are many registered names in certain Member States. Nevertheless, growing interest in the system has been observed in many Member States.\nThe procedure for registering a name generally takes several years. This is because the applicant group has to draw up specifications and have them approved at national level and then by the Commission. The single document summary of the specifications for geographical indications or the specifications themselves for traditional specialties a", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 4 November 1999.\n\nStatement by the President\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, since our last part-session, and particularly in the last few days, several terrible catastrophes have taken place, such as the new earthquake in Turkey and the floods in France, both of which have hit hard. With your agreement, I would simply like to express, on behalf of the European Parliament, my deepest sympathy and condolences to the victims of these new tragedies and their families.\n\nNapoletano\nMadam President, I would like to add that, on Friday, a United Nations aeroplane crashed. It was carrying 21 volunteers on the WFP programme for the reconstruction of Kosovo and 3 crewmembers. I think that we should remember these victims too, and thank these people for the incredible and useful work they did and pass on our condolences to their relatives, as well as addressing the reason that caused this catastrophe. I would therefore ask you, President, if you think it appropriate, to hold a minute' s silence as well in memory of these heroes of our time.\n\nPresident\nIt goes without saying, Mrs Napoletano, that I shall pass on everything you have said and all our sympathy to those concerned. It also happens to be the same plane that Mr Swoboda, Mrs Pack, Mrs Nicholson and I took when we went to Pristina. It is a tragedy. We shall request an inquiry to find the causes of this accident. We shall discuss this with Mr Kouchner and once again, you can count on me to pass on all our condolences to the victims' families.\n\nAgenda\nAndrews\nI would just like to discuss the issue of Chechnya and our continued support for the Russian Government. The genocide that is taking place in Chechnya seems to be ignored by the Western powers and certainly by the European Parliament. I want to ask you, Madam President, if you would ask somebody from the Commission or one of the Commissioners to come here to addr", "Corporate social responsibility (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Howitt on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on corporate social responsibility: a new partnership.\nRichard Howitt \nrapporteur. - Mr President, companies, politicians and above all people understand that the problems of world poverty and of environmental degradation remain stubbornly prevalent in today's world. For ten years, many companies have begun to examine how they can manage their own social and environmental impacts through initiatives for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Business cannot be expected to take responsibility alone for meeting these challenges. However, it is now time for the communications, the conferences and the codes of conduct to begin to make a significant and measurable difference and a move from process to outcome.\nIn this vote, the European Parliament will draw attention to the limitations of voluntary CSR reporting and of social auditing as it exists today. We will say that the drive for ever lower prices can prejudice fair treatment for people at work. We will insist that CSR can only work by adopting a multi-stakeholder approach, internationally-agreed standards and independent monitoring and verification. We will call for actions to tackle corporate abuses in the world's developing countries and to provide means for redress for its victims.\nThe Commission's communications seem to me to opt out of this debate, to prescribe an 'anything goes' approach to CSR and to risk Europe falling behind, compared with the rest of the world. However, tonight I am not proposing that we reject the Commission's approach. Indeed, I am asking the European Parliament to contribute constructively by seeking to rewrite some of the agenda and, where the Commission is making commitments, to come forward with detailed recommendations to turn fine words into concrete actions, to give full transparency to the evolving alliance for business, to rebu", "Voting time \nSajjad Karim\nMr President, 48 hours from now, as millions of Muslims will still be celebrating Eid and the world will be remembering the terrorist atrocity of 9/11, a Koran burning has been planned to coincide with this in Florida, USA. This act has been denounced by the US Administration and the Vatican. I hope this House will do likewise.\n(Applause)\nThis extreme act of Koran burning is the act of one man and his followers alone. His actions should not be identified with the West or Christianity. Muslims globally must be told that, through this Koran burning, that pastor will achieve nothing. He has been isolated in his country and by his religion. It is only through a reaction that any perverse sense of achievement can be earned.\n(Sustained applause)\nGerard Batten\nMr President, irrespective of the merits of Mr Karim's remarks, I fail to see how that was a point of order. If anybody else had stood up to make a statement, you would have asked them under which Rule they were speaking. Can you please tell me how that was a point of order?\nPresident\nMr Batten, it was a point of order, information to the House.\n", "Deterioration of the situation in Georgia (debate) \nPresident\n(EL) The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the deterioration of the situation in Georgia.\nJanez Lenar\u010di\u010d\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (SL) Before I begin speaking about Georgia, I would like to respond to the statement by the President of the European Parliament at the beginning of today's sitting in connection with Burma/Myanmar. Since this is the first time that I have spoken today, I would like, on behalf of the Presidency, to convey my sincere condolences to all the relatives of the victims of Cyclone Nargis in Burma/Myanmar. I would also draw your attention to the Presidency statement published yesterday in which the Presidency expressed the willingness of the European Union to provide that country with emergency humanitarian assistance.\nReturning to Georgia, honourable Members, I welcome the decision of the European Parliament to place the situation in Georgia on the agenda because relations between Georgia and the Russian Federation are very unstable. The Council is monitoring the situation in that country very closely. The General Affairs and External Relations Council discussed Georgia recently, on 29 April. The matter was also discussed yesterday by the Political and Security Committee, which was also addressed by Deputy Prime Minister Baramidze.\nOn 2 May the Presidency responded, on behalf of the European Union, by publishing a statement on the escalation of tension between Georgia and Russia. The High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy Javier Solana had previously spoken twice to President Saakashvili and on 30 April met Georgian special envoy Mr Bakradze. The Presidency also discussed recent events with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov at the meeting between the European Union Troika and Russia held in Luxembourg.\nI would like to emphasise that the European Union is very concerned by the recent series of events which have brought a", "Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting\nPresident.\n?he Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nAlyssandrakis (GUE/NGL).\nMr President, my comment refers to the point of order I made yesterday, which has been wrongly recorded in the Minutes. The Minutes say that I protested about the recent change to the Criminal Code in Slovakia. In fact an amendment has been tabled in an attempt to change the code; it has not been changed already and I would be obliged if this could be corrected.\n\nPresident.\nRest assured, Mr Alyssandrakis, the correction you request will be made.\n\nKorakas (GUE/NGL).\nMr President, I asked for the floor yesterday, but my request was refused due to a lack of time. What I wanted to say was that even though, according to the information available, the possibility of an imminent attack by Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip cannot be discounted, never mind the carnage that will unleash, even though the ruling Likud party in Israel is open in its opposition to the creation of a Palestinian state and has passed a resolution to that effect and 13 Palestinian fighters have been expelled from their homeland as terrorists at Sharon's insistence, the Council has still not reached a decision and I have no idea which countries the Council will finally decide should accept these fighters.\nMy question is this: what will the status of these thirteen fighters be, wherever they end up, and is there any possibility of their being returned at Israel's request, which would, of course, be criminal. Also, does the European Union intend to continue to aid and abet the regime in Israel, in blatant disregard of the European Parliament's resolution that the partnership with Israel should be suspended, and does it intend to continue funding and arming this criminal regime?\n\nPresident.\nThank you for your intervention, Mr Korakas but for the moment, as you know, we are discussing the Minutes and the order of business. There is a whole de", "Small Business Act review (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on\nthe oral question to the Council on the Small Business Act (SBA) review by Bendt Bendtsen, on behalf of the PPE Group, Edit Herczog, on behalf of the S&D Group, Fiona Hall, on behalf of the ALDE Group, Reinhard B\u00fctikofer, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, Giles Chichester, on behalf of the ECR Group, and Niki Tzavela, on behalf of the EFD Group - B7-0301/2011),\nthe oral question to the Commission on the Small Business Act (SBA) review by Bendt Bendtsen, on behalf of the PPE Group, Edit Herczog, on behalf of the S&D Group, Fiona Hall, on behalf of the ALDE Group, Reinhard B\u00fctikofer, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, Giles Chichester, on behalf of the ECR Group, and Niki Tzavela, on behalf of the EFD Group - B7-0302/2011).\nBendt Bendtsen\nMr President, the economic crisis has had an effect on Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises. In addition, there are the new Basel rules that are now to be implemented in the forthcoming Capital Requirements Directive. This will probably make it even more difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises to obtain capital for the growth that Europe needs. In this resolution, the European Parliament is sending a clear signal to the Commission that it is now that the necessary decisions need to be taken to benefit our small and medium-sized enterprises.\nNow it is true that politicians should not be running businesses, but they should be involved in creating the fertile soil in which Europe's businesses can grow. I am pleased that we will now have a revision of the Small Business Act. We must take relevant action instead of merely toasting our European enterprises. There is an urgent need for better access to financing for small and medium-sized enterprises. There is also a need for enhanced market access, including the modernisation of the standardisation system within the EU, and for better access for small and medium-sized enterprises to public procureme", "Strengthening European legislation in the field of information and consultation of workers (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement: Strengthening European legislation in the field of information and consultation of workers.\nVladim\u00edr \u0160pidla\nMr President, honourable Members, keeping workers informed and consulting with them is a significant element of the European Social Model's response to the challenges posed by globalisation, economic competition and technological change. Included in that response is change management, the anticipation of change and social dialogue.\nI do not have to remind the House of the importance the Commission attaches to European Works Councils. They enable us to reduce the imbalance arising from inadequate representation, in other words due to the fact that a growing number of decisions are taken at supranational level, whereas the law on informing employees and problem resolution is implemented mainly at national level.\nThey provide support for the social partners in each country and facilitate general understanding of the strategic problems of businesses and the search for solutions. In particular they allow for the anticipation and management of change. In the era of globalisation, Europe must address a number of economic and social problems.\nWe are well aware that business restructuring is something feared not only by the employees affected but also by other citizens. We also know that when it comes to addressing this phenomenon there is only one possible approach, and that is to be decisive, proactive and dynamic. The EU must contribute towards preparing for the changes brought about by restructuring and towards managing them in a responsible way - whether by means of the structural funds, in particular the European Social Fund or through political dialogue in the context of the restructuring forums introduced by the Commission - and towards the implementation of the Community's regulatory framework for the informa", "8. Single European railway area (\nRamon Tremosa i Balcells\nMr President, I am the Liberal shadow rapporteur on this report. The Liberal Group would like to make an oral amendment. In the last sentence of Article 6(4), we would like to improve the text, adding only four words. After 'capital employed' we could add 'except from public funding'. I think that the other rapporteurs of the big Groups are in favour of this.\n", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nAndrews\nMr President, I have come into possession of a letter you wrote to a Secretary of State in England, Mr Howard, indicating that you did not approve of a meeting with Rois\u00edn McAliskey in Holloway Prison; that it was not an official delegation. It was not intended to be an official delegation. What was intended was that a delegation from the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs should visit Rois\u00edn McAliskey. This delegation would not contain Irish or British Members.\nOn a humanitarian basis, I want to ask you why you wrote this letter to Mr Howard. On what authority? Under what rule or regulation did you write the letter? If you, at the beginning of your presidency, are going to behave towards Hedy d'Ancona, a distinguished parliamentarian for many years, and the other Members of the European Parliament in this fashion, it seems to me that your presidency will fail almost instantly. When I saw this letter to Mr Howard, I have to say I was absolutely horrified and so were other Members of the European Parliament to whom I showed it.\nMr President, would you please indicate to the House on what basis and why you wrote this letter cancelling the visit by Hedy d'Ancona and other Members of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs?\n\nPresident\nI am very happy to respond, Mr Andrews. Pursuant to Rule 24 of the Rules of Procedure, the Conference of Presidents is the body responsible for all political relations of the committees of this Parliament. It is therefore standard practice for a committee seeking authorization for a visit, to approach the Conference of Presidents, and the Conference of Presidents will either grant it or not. So my letter was sent with the knowledge of the Conference of Presidents, to make clear that it was not a committee delegation authorized under the Rules of Procedure. I have to comply with the Rules,", "Question Time (Council) \nPresident\nThe next item is questions to the Council (B6-0013/2008).\nThe following questions have been put to the Council.\nAs they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:\nSubject: Lisbon Treaty\nAre there any issues that still need to be clarified in the current text of the Lisbon Treaty, and have all the concerns of the Slovenian Presidency regarding substance, procedure and time-frame for implementation of the Treaty been met? If this is not the case, could the Council outline what the outstanding issues are?\nSubject: Council President\nHave there been any preliminary discussions in the Council on who is going to be the President of the EU Council once the Treaty of Lisbon is ratified?\nGay Mitchell\nMr President, on a point of order, it most certainly is not the same. Could we please have some respect for the rights of Members of Parliament? To be adding questions together in this way is a disgrace. One Question Time is getting worse than the next! There is no relationship whatsoever between the two questions. I protest strongly at the way Members of this House are treated.\nPresident\nI understand, Mr Mitchell, but the more time we spend on these matters, the less time we will have to get answers to other questions also legitimately put by Members. It was a Council decision to answer these questions together. The honourable Member will not suffer as he will of course have the opportunity to speak on his particular question. I therefore feel that he will not suffer any loss.\nWe will therefore continue with our work; otherwise we will waste more time that we cannot afford to lose. It is becoming increasingly difficult to achieve a minimum level of productivity in these Question Times, which are so important for our parliamentary work. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have the floor.\nJanez Lenar\u010di\u010d\nPresident-in-Office. - (SL) I should stress that, as far as the Council is concerned, it makes no differe", "Opening of the sitting\n(The sitting opened at 10.00)\nEdward McMillan-Scott\nMr President, I rise simply to report to the House the good news that last night the President of Pakistan, who was our guest a few weeks ago, has commuted the death sentence on my constituent Mirza-Tahir Hussain, who had been on death row for 18 years but is widely regarded to be innocent of the charges against him. A number of Members of the European Parliament, led by Mr Karim, were going to Pakistan next month to make a final plea. Now, of course, we shall turn our efforts towards ensuring Mr Hussain can return to Leeds by Christmas.\nI am delighted at this news and hope that the President of Parliament will make a statement later today. I know he has worked very hard on this case, as have other Members of Parliament.\n(Applause)\n", "\n\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013 The next item is the report (A6-0131/2005) by Marie Anne Isler B\u00e9guin, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the Financial Instrument for the Environment (LIFE +) (COM(2004)0621 \u2013 C6-0127/2004 \u2013 2004/0218(COD)). \nStavros Dimas,\n\u00a0\u00a0 . Mr President, I should like to thank the European Parliament, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and, most importantly, the rapporteur, Mrs Isler B\u00e9guin, for her detailed and constructive report. My thanks also to the honourable members of the Committee on Budgets and Temporary Committee on the Financial Perspectives for their contribution to the report on LIFE +.\nLIFE + is the financial instrument for applying Community environmental policy proposed by the Commission for the period 2007-2013. Alongside application, the programme has resources for improving environmental governance and for financing information and communication actions.\nThis proposal is a positive arrangement for financing the environment. As the reports which the Commission prepared for the Council made clear, LIFE + makes provision for an average annual increase in financing of 21% compared with current levels.\nIn addition, it makes provision for the new programme to shift from a project-based approach to an approach based on national programmes. This safeguards greater flexibility for the Member States, so that they can deal with their most pressing environmental needs.\nThis approach implies even greater subsidiarity than at present. Thus the regional and local factors which often lead the way in the application of environmental legislation will be able to have their say on the planning and application of the programme.\nI am aware of Parliament's evaluation of the Commission proposal. However, the Commission considers that most spending on the environment can be better financed by the financin", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nPresident\nWe shall now proceed to the explanations of vote.\nJaros\u0142aw Kalinowski\n(PL) The Baltic Sea is a European asset which we all share, so it is important to take steps which will allow us to protect it from ourselves.\nThat may sound paradoxical, but some branches of the economy, such as industry, agriculture and fishing - if they are managed badly - can adversely affect the Baltic's biosystems. Therefore, despite the things which have to be done to benefit essential processes in the economy, it is our duty to make sure we care for and protect the Baltic, which is an exceptional natural resource. Neglecting the Baltic's biodiversity will harm those sectors of the economy which benefit from the Baltic's water. Therefore, supranational and cross-border cooperation is essential in this area.\nOnly thanks to joint research, including the participation of Russian scientists, can we create an effective system which protects the Baltic Sea and allows its potential to be used in an innovative way.\nPeter Jahr\n(DE) Mr President, I would like to extend a very warm welcome to Estonia on joining the euro area. I am pleased about every new member of the euro area, because a common currency is an important integrating factor. Nevertheless, I would like to remind the Commission at this point that there are stability criteria which must be met. Sometimes I get the impression that existing members of the euro area have special rights. Rules are there to be followed. Anyone who breaches the rules must be punished. This applies particularly to the euro stability criteria.\nSiiri Oviir\n(ET) I have faith in the euro as a currency, and, of course, as the Estonian representative, I supported the adoption of the report and the adoption of the euro from next year. Our budget deficit is small and our public sector debt is one of the lowest in Europe. The government has made cuts wherever it can. The result - approval at European Union level - i", "Agenda\nPresident\nWe have an announcement before we start with regard to this afternoon's debates. I should like to propose bringing forward the debate on the report by D\u00edaz de Mera Garc\u00eda Consuegra on EUROPOL and taking it as the second item before the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Pakistan.\nThe order of business this afternoon would, therefore, be as follows: from 15.00 to 18.00: first of all, the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Kenya, then the report by D\u00edaz de Mera Garc\u00eda Consuegra on EUROPOL, then the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Pakistan; then at 18.00, as normal, we would go on to Question Time with the Council.\nAre there any comments?\nHannes Swoboda\non behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, for once we can agree, but I should like the Commission to note that it is Parliament that sets the agenda and only in exceptional circumstances can we respond to the wishes of individual Commissioners. We can agree today, however, by way of exception.\nPresident\nThank you for that point, Mr Swoboda; it clearly is an exception. But I thank the House for its agreement.\n(Parliament agreed to the request)\n", "Monitoring the application of Community law (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Frassoni, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the Commission's 23rd Annual report on monitoring the application of Community law (2005) .\nMonica Frassoni\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, the application of Community law is a key part of the 'better lawmaking' agenda launched by the Barroso Commission. For some time it has been a kind of Cinderella, lost amidst the fashion for impact assessments and cutting costs.\nToday the Commission has started to rectify this, partly due to the pressure applied by Parliament. This is a procedure that, for years, has in many cases just been a kind of bureaucratic grind, where one infringement follows another without much ado, but it remains an absolutely essential procedure.\nThe numbers speak very clearly. To date, around 2 518 infringement procedures have been initiated in the most diverse sectors, particularly the environment and the internal market. In addition to this there are the hundreds, thousands even, of petitions that the Parliament receives each year and that often refer to specific infringements of Community law, against which citizens feel helpless and therefore turn to Parliament.\nThe question is: what chance do they have of receiving satisfaction? The infringement procedure is described by Articles 226 and 228 of the Treaty, and therefore there is not much scope for creativity. The rules in force condemn us to slow, muddled procedures where the most effective measure - a fine - is rarely applied and only after a very long time, decades even.\nHowever, a great deal, a very great deal, can be done and I thank the Commission for proposing in the last two years, and then last September in a specific communication, a series of measures that are analysed and evaluated in my report, and on which I would like to make a few comments.\nFirst, however, allow me to make a point that I believe is crucial in this debate", "2. (\n- Before the vote:\nMeglena Kuneva\nMember of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to take the opportunity to clarify a point which was raised in yesterday's debate on the proposal for a Consumer Credit Directive. This point concerned the new version of Article 8 concerning the obligation to assess the credit-worthiness of consumers. Both amendments 46 and 45 foresee that Member States whose legislation requires creditors to assess the creditworthiness of consumers on the basis of consultation of the relevant database may retain this requirement. As I understand it, this also means that the sanctions foreseen in this national legislation for a failure of the creditor to fulfil these requirements could also be retained.\nKurt Lechner\nrapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, as we have now been debating this guideline in the institutions for six years, I would therefore like to make a few comments. Firstly, I would say that this should not be taken as a criticism, but this lengthy period shows how European legislators have dealt very earnestly with this complicated subject and how close consumer protection lies to our hearts in Europe. I am confident that the legislative procedure will be finalised with today's vote, which is also my intention, despite all the differences on the subject at various points. I want to expressly put on record that in my view all the joint amendments now available without exception improve the Council's text, the joint position. They certainly also hark back for the most part to my own proposals.\nTo clarify matters, I wish to say that we have wanted to reach an agreement, and in order to come to an agreement, on Article 16(2) as well, which until recently had actually been disputed merely on account of the wording, we have decided to approve the proposal by the Socialists and Liberals in order to resolve this issue amicably, just as we have also withdrawn a few other amendments for the sake of harmony.\nI also wish to thank the Comm", "\nPresident. \u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is the statements from the Council and the Commission on the Members' Statute. \nAntonione,\n\u00a0\u00a0  \u2013 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate on a Statute for Members of the European Parliament.\nMr President, when the Council Presidency wrote to you on 21 November 2003, we stated clearly that the Council was fully open to dialogue with Parliament on this issue. Moreover, that statement confirmed the offer made by the Greek Presidency, in the person of Mr Papandreou, on 20 June 2003. That is why today\u2019s debate is important, providing us with an opportunity to move forward and to explore the possibility of reaching agreement at last after 25 years.\nMr President, the Council fully respects the primary role played by the European Parliament in drawing up the Statute for its Members. According to the procedure laid down in the Treaty, it is Parliament\u2019s responsibility to lay down the regulations and general conditions governing the performance of the duties of its Members, after seeking an opinion from the Commission and with the approval of the Council, which requires unanimity as regards taxation. It is therefore clear that the European Parliament cannot introduce the Statute without the consent of the Council, and the Council cannot approve the Statute unless Parliament puts forward proposals it can accept. It would be as well to remember this.\nMr President, I know that many of you are keen to know what the Council's position is on the Statute in general and, more specifically, on a number of proposals which have been made at different levels in recent weeks.\nWhen Parliament forwarded its proposal for a Statute to the Council last June, it was clear that substantial differences existed between our respective positions, thus preventing the Council from giving its approval. You will remember that, before that, last March, the Greek President-in-Office of the Council, Mr\u00a0Papandreou, outlined to", "Alternative investment fund managers (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Jean-Paul Gauz\u00e8s, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on Alternative investment fund managers and amending Directives 2004/39/EC and 2009/.../EC - C7-0040/2009 -.\nJean-Paul Gauz\u00e8s\nMr President, Mr Reynders, Commissioner, the text we are debating this evening, and which will be put to the vote in Parliament tomorrow, is the result of a long period of work. On 30 April 2009, the European Commission published its proposal for a directive on alternative investment fund managers. It aims to establish a safe, harmonised framework at European Union level to monitor and supervise the risks presented by managers for their investors, their counterparties, other actors in the financial markets and financial stability, while making it possible for managers, subject to observing strict requirements, to provide services and market their funds throughout the internal market.\nMr President, may I just pause a moment, I wanted to know whether, given the length of our work, I had no time limit, because I see that the clock has not started. It does not bother me but, for honesty's sake, I wanted to draw it to your attention.\nParliament received the text about 14 months ago. It has aroused obvious interest among Members of the European Parliament, as a record number of 1 690 amendments have been tabled. Professionals have been involved very extensively and the rapporteur has had nearly 200 discussions on this text, not counting the discussions with national authorities.\nFinalising the compromise text that is being debated today has been particularly hard work. Half a dozen informal trialogues took place under the Spanish Presidency during the first half of 2010 in order to facilitate the exchange of information on the progress of the work. No agreement was reached in the Council during this period.\n", "Trade and economic relations with Western Balkans (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Belder, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on trade and economic relations with Western Balkans.\nBastiaan Belder\nrapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to present my report on trade and economic relations with the western Balkans.\nIt is not without a reason that I started this report by reiterating the European perspective of those countries. The Union cannot continue to faithfully repeat past promises, such as that made to the western Balkan states at the Thessaloniki European Council of 2003 that they would join the European Union. No, the western Balkans would be better served by tangible action and tailored accession procedures than by well-nigh dutiful rhetoric.\nYou may well ask why I hold the accession prospects of those countries so dear. First of all, I am wholly convinced that the Union has a debt of honour to repay. This reminds me of the debate on Srebrenica which will hopefully be held in this House on Wednesday evening this week. Moreover, that region is of major strategic significance for Europe. The specific proposals in my report are as follows. I argue in favour of further consolidation of the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA). This is an important tool to enhance regional integration in that area, which is, in turn, important preparation if those countries want to integrate in the European market and join the Union in three stages. The European Union should mobilise pre-accession funds through aid across a wide front so as to promote the reform process in those countries. The Member States can also play an important role in this by providing specific training to local public servants.

Conference on Biological Diversity - Nagoya 2010 (vote) \n- Before the vote:\nBruno Gollnisch\n(FR) Mr President, I will be very brief.

You do not have the floor. This is not a point of order. If you continue shouting, you will be taken out of this room politely.\nSandrine B\u00e9lier\n(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask you to consider that the exact and original wording of paragraph 35 of the resolution, which is put to the vote and which stresses that corporate social responsibility should include biodiversity, is the French version, and that that should be the version used. Moreover, the word 'social', which has disappeared from the English version, should be reinserted and the version corrected.\nSandrine B\u00e9lier\n(FR) Mr President, you invited us to vote for the original text of paragraph 16. However, there was a separate vote beforehand, and paragraph 16 was amended. There were two separate votes. Therefore, we voted for the original text but not for the amendment.\nEsther de Lange\nMr President, before we take the final vote - and although I am very happy with the fact that we adopted Amendment 1 - I think that Ms B\u00e9lier of the Greens is right. In fact, you called out to vote on the original paragraph.\nOn the screens, we then saw that we voted on Amendment 1. To be fair to the Greens, I think we should take the vot", "7.

I ask my fellow Members to continue to support this recommendation, and to vote for Parliament's original proposal. For my part, I have taken note that the political declaration contains this proposal to a slightly limited degree.\n", "Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nHelmer\nMr President, on Monday I made a point of order about President Nicole Fontaine's reported comments in the British press regarding her recent visit with Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. A British Labour Member of this House, Mr Miller, repeated what were purported to be the Queen's remarks, not once but three times, on Monday, on Tuesday and on Wednesday. He sought to drag the Queen into a political controversy and to use her name to score cheap political points.\nMr President, it may be that President Fontaine was unfamiliar with the British rules of protocol which obtain in such matters, but Mr Miller has no such excuse. He knows perfectly well that ours is a non-political Head of State. He knows perfectly well that for nearly fifty years she has scrupulously avoided engaging in controversial political issues. He knows perfectly well that she cannot come to this House to set the record straight. His behaviour is a disgrace and a scandal.\nMr President, I am proud to be British but today I am ashamed to share my nationality with that man. Has he no shame? Has he no respect? Has he no decency or honour at all?\n\nMiller\nMr President, well, how can I respond to such an attack as that? When I raised the point on Monday, and on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, I asked Mr Helmer for his comments on the euro. So far, he has refused to comment. Can I also say that when Mrs Fontaine spoke to Her Majesty the Queen and obviously put certain questions to her the Queen, in her response, was representing her government, which is a Labour Government. That might not suit Mr Helmer, but I am sorry to say that is the way it goes.\nCan I also say yes, I am Scottish, yes, I am British, but, Mr Helmer, I am European as well and proud to be.\n\nSeguro\nMr President, I wish to use this point of order to speak in my capacity as chairman of the delegation fo", "8. Future of the CAP after 2013 (\nUlrike Rodust\n(DE) Mr President, I have not asked for the floor to raise a point of order, but I would like to ask you, Mr President, and my fellow Members to be aware of the following: there is a problem with the translation here. I have tabled an amendment to the Lyon report, recital Ae: 'whereas the CAP must be geared to the maintenance and development of multifunctional, sustainable agriculture throughout Europe.' Unfortunately, the word 'extensive' has been used in the translations. However, the word 'fl\u00e4chendeckend' in the German translation has a completely different meaning. It means 'in all of the regions of Europe'. There should be agriculture ('fl\u00e4chendeckend' agriculture) even throughout mountainous regions. 'Extensive' means something entirely different.\nPresident\nThank you for pointing this out. We will correct the texts and harmonise them with the original.\n- After the vote on paragraph 44:\nGeorge Lyon\nrapporteur. - Mr President, there seems to be some confusion as to what we were actually voting on there. The interpretation told us it was 44, and yet you are announcing that 45 has been accepted. There is some confusion that you need to sort out and get the votes right and call them right.\nPresident\nWe were voting on paragraph 44, as I told you. I repeat: the amendment has fallen, and paragraph 44 has been adopted. That is the outcome of the vote.\nPablo Arias Echeverr\u00eda\n(ES) Mr President, we have just voted on paragraph 44, and although my vote was in favour, I put down 'against' because there was some slight confusion: we were told that we were voting on 45, when in reality we were voting on 44.\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, if there are so many protests - please listen - we are voting on paragraph 44 again. We are voting on paragraph 44. The vote was not clear for me, either, because you did not raise your hands.\n- Before the vote on paragraph 59:\nElizabeth Lynne\nMr President, we need clarification.

Mr President, firstly I would like to say that I am grateful for the work done by the Members of the committees concerned with this Commission proposal to amend Decision 90/424/EEC on expenditure in the veterinary field. This year, the Commission allocated approximately EUR 210 million to assist Member States in running eradication and monitoring programmes to counter animal diseases. This programme is a key element in our food safety strategy.\nAs we all know, animal diseases are unpredictable - the unexpected can and does happen. In 2005-2006 even though we saw outbreaks of avian flu, blue tongue and classical swine fever in some Member States, none of them was a major outbreak and we managed to keep them under control and not allow them to cause extensive damage.\nThe Commission has embarked on a wide-ranging review of Community animal health policy. An extensive evaluation has recently been completed and the results were presented at a conference held in Brussels last month. I was pleased to note that several honourable Members attended, and indeed chaired, sessions.\nOne of the primary areas of interest for discussion today and one which generated considerable interest was the possible introduction of an insurance or cost-sharing element to help fund disease eradication costs. However, these are longer-term measures which still need considerable discussion with the various stakeholders before we can determine how best to proceed. There are, however, a number of key changes which we can make now, in order to improve efficiency in how the Commission and the Member States manage funding in this area. The proposal before us today aims to make", "2. EC/Georgia, Lebanon, Maldives, Moldova, Singapore and Uruguay Agreements: Protocols amending the Agreements on certain aspects of air services following the accession of Bulgaria and Romania (vote) \n- Report: Paolo Costa\n", "Sludge catastrophe in Hungary (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the sludge catastrophe in Hungary.\nKristalina Georgieva\nMember of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like first to express my deepest sympathy to the families of the victims and to all those who are affected by the industrial accident that occurred on 4 October in Ajka, Hungary. I also would like to recognise the decisive and effective actions of the Hungarian authorities to contain the impact of the spill and its spread from the rivers Torna and Marcal downstream into the Danube and into neighbouring countries, and also to prevent the risks of new spills by building additional protection walls.\nI had the opportunity to thank Minister S\u00e1ndor Pint\u00e9r, the Hungarian Minister of the Interior in charge of civil protection, for all the efforts of the various services involved and for the bravery and dedication of the first responders.\nI have just come back from the site of the accident where I witnessed both the catastrophic impact of the red sludge on people, homes, land and the ecology of the region, and the significant efforts of the Hungarian response teams.\nWhile the causes of the disaster and its full impact are still under investigation, it is clear that the most severe damage is in the immediate vicinity of the accident and the directly affected human settlements, agricultural land and ecological systems. 7 000 inhabitants, mainly from the villages of Kolont\u00e1r and Devecser, have been affected. Nine people died and 130 have been injured, about 35 of them first responders.\nAround 1 000 hectares of agricultural land and four Natura 2000 sites have been affected, and there has been substantial damage to flora and fauna in the area.\nAccording to the information provided by the Hungarian authorities, the red mud does not contain high concentrations of heavy metals and is therefore not considered as hazardous waste.\nNonetheless, dust from the sludge presents a health ri", "Status of elected MEPs in Poland (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate concerning an oral question to the Commission from Giuseppe Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs - B6-0002/2008) concerning the status of MEPs elected in Poland.\nGiuseppe Gargani\nauthor. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue that we are discussing tonight has been examined in detail, on more than one occasion I may say, by the Committee on Legal Affairs, which I have the honour to chair, and that Committee has asked me, through this question, to open a discussion and to exchange views with the Commission.\nThe question relates to the status of MEPs elected in Poland, who are not in the same position from the point of view of elections and all the provisions that govern the elections of other parliamentarians in other Member States. Elections to the European Parliament in Poland are in practice governed by the Act of 23 January 2004, Article 9 of which sets out eligibility requirements: candidates must be aged 21 on the day of the poll, must not have been convicted of criminal offences, must be resident in Poland and must satisfy various other criteria.\nChapter 17 of that Act sets out the circumstances in which Polish MEPs may lose their seats: their eligibility, that is the eligibility requirements on the day of the poll, may be invalidated, giving rise to the possibility of forfeiture if these requirements were not met, and various other matters, which I shall not cite in order to get to the crux of the matter that I should like to discuss here.\nOn the basis of a number of combined provisions, as we lawyers say, an MEP automatically loses his seat - that is, an MEP automatically forfeits that seat - if he or she has received a criminal conviction; in the case of members of the Polish Parliament, the law of 12 April 2001 - both as regards elections to the Sejm and to the Senate of the Republic - contains no provision of this type, with the result that these", "Preparation for the European Council meeting (24-25 March 2011) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on preparation for the European Council meeting to be held on 24 and 25 March 2011.\nEnik\u0151 Gy\u0151ri\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, President Barroso, Commissioner, honourable Members, I very much welcome the opportunity to appear before you in advance of the next meeting of the European Council. As you know, it will be a very intensive meeting due to the unforeseen events of the last couple of weeks.\nLet me first run you through the main issues on the agenda of the European Council. There will be three major items: first a comprehensive economic package which, hopefully, will be adopted by the Heads of State and Government; then Libya and the southern neighbourhood; and thirdly Japan.\nLet me start with the economic policy issues. The European Council will, I hope, adopt this package in order to respond to the economic and financial crisis. The package has six major elements, the first being the conclusion of the first phase of the European Semester, with endorsement of the priorities for fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. As you know, the European Semester cycle started early in the year with the presentation of the Commission's annual growth survey. It brings together various policy recommendations required to strengthen recovery, to help Europe maintain its international competitiveness and to achieve the EU 2020 objectives.\nThe first phase of the European Semester will now be concluded with the endorsement by the European Council of the priorities for fiscal consolidation and structural reform, in line with the conclusions prepared by the ECOFIN and EPSCO Councils. The theme of this report - which was prepared by the Presidency - was welcomed by the General Affairs Council last Monday. Member States will take these broad policy orientations into account when preparing their stability and c", "Enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection (debate) \nPresident\n\u03a4he next item is the recommendation by Mr Klaus-Heiner Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision authorising enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection [05538/2011 - C7-0044/2011 - 2010/0384(NLE)].\nKlaus-Heiner Lehne\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are dealing with the subject of enhanced cooperation here for a second time. A few months ago, we decided on enhanced cooperation for the first time under the Treaty of Lisbon in relation to the field of family law. Now we are to do so a second time. It is a purely procedural decision that is to be taken here. I want to make that clear, because at this point, we will not be debating the content of the issues in question. That will take place at a later date.\nLet me start by observing that I have been very pleased to see that the Hungarian Presidency is also present here today. This is a first, you might say, as I believe this is the first time in the history of the European Parliament that the Presidency has been present on a Monday evening. This also shows, perhaps, how important this portfolio that we are debating today actually is.\nWe have been debating the issue of the European patent on the basis of a proposal from the Commission since 2001. Within the framework of the Palacio report, Parliament took a very specific position, including in relation to potential solutions, in respect of first reading. It proved impossible to reach agreement about the patent in the Council, which was essentially due to two problems. One of the problems is the courts issue - which courts are to be competent for which disputes - but there was also the language issue. The courts issue will possibly be resolved soon through a decision of the European Court of Justice in an opinion at the beginning of March, at which point we will know precisely what can a", "EU - South Korea free trade agreement (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Daniel Caspary, Peter \u0160\u0165astn\u00fd, Pawe\u0142 Zalewski, David Martin, Gianluca Susta, Kader Arif, Michael Theurer, Niccol\u00f2 Rinaldi, Metin Kazak, Marielle De Sarnez and Jan Zahradil, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the European Conservatives and Reformists, on the free trade agreement between the EU and South Korea - B7-0001/2010).\nDaniel Caspary\nMadam President, Commissioner, the negotiations on the agreement with South Korea have been completed and the documents have been initialled. That is a very good thing. However, if we look at the details of the agreement, it seems as if speed took precedence over thoroughness. I have the impression that your predecessor wanted the agreement to be signed and sealed at any price, so that she had at least one success during her period of office.\nWe are familiar with the many expert reports which were drawn up before the start of negotiations and which clearly indicated the many possible benefits for European industry and the European economy. There is likely to be a positive impact on the mechanical engineering, chemical, pharmaceutical, food and service industries. All of these sectors and many others hope to gain major benefits from the agreement. However, the main protests are coming from the car industry. There are difficulties with the duty drawback system, with the question of the amount of parts from foreign suppliers that can be used in cars from South Korea and with the issue of environmental standards which remain unresolved.\nI would like to see us not only addressing but resolving many of these criticisms over the next few months using the safeguard mechanisms and the safeguard regulation.

Safety of Toys (\n- After the vote on Amendment 142:\nHerbert Reul\n(DE) Mr President, on a point of order, we are of course in the process of adopting a decision, a directive, on the basis of a trialogue agreement. We had a similar state of affairs yesterday with regard to emissions trading. Today we are rightly putting all the other amendments to the vote separately after adopting the overall decision; which I feel is right and proper. We did not do so yesterday, and, indeed, I cannot understand why not. The facts of the matter were the same, but separate votes were not held; which I do not consider acceptable. After all, I and 40 fellow Members tabled amendments yesterday, and I think I am entitled to see votes on those, too.\nPresident\nI am only doing my job, and I have only an executive function. I may have influence, but I do not have any real power.\nHannes Swoboda\n(DE) Mr President, it would make sense for you to get together with the Conference of Presidents to consider the introduction of a general procedure. I would certainly welcome the one followed yesterday, but we should always use the same voting system in such cases.\nPresident\nWe shall convey that to the Conference of Presidents, and shall come to a decision one way or another.\nEvelyne Gebhardt\n(DE) Mr President, one component of the agreement between Parliament and the Council was a statement by the Commission, which Commissioner Verheugen had promised us. He failed to make this statement on Monday. I had assumed that Commissioner Verheugen - who is not present here today, of course, but is represented by Commissioner Barrot - would make this statement, which concerns three points important to Parliament, in this House prior to the vote, but I have yet to hear any such statement. I wish to know the actual course of the procedure without delay.\nPresident\nThe President was not informed about this, but I have taken note of it now. Mrs Gebhardt, when do you consider an appropriate time for the Commissio", "Welcome\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, if you will allow me, I would like to point out that a group of guests have been in the gallery, a group of men and women who are known in my country as 'war children'. They were children who, between 1936 and 1939, fled Spain, the fascist bombardments, who were evacuated and who found solidarity and care in families in Belgium and the United Kingdom. Today, with all of them over 75 years old, they have come to visit Parliament, to be amongst us, and it is very important and very moving for us to pay tribute to them and, in particular, to pay tribute to the solidarity of the British and Belgian people, who took them in and provided them with the families that they had been denied in their own country.\n", "Childcare facilities - Barcelona objectives (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on childcare facilities - Barcelona objectives.\nVladim\u00edr \u0160pidla\nMadam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the opportunity, a few days after International Women's Day on 8 March, to make a declaration before the European Parliament on childcare facilities for pre-school age children. These facilities are essential for promoting gender equality and for helping to achieve a work-life balance, but also for ensuring quality of life for children. At a meeting of the European Council in Barcelona in 2002, the Member States adopted ambitious aims which were to be fulfilled by 2010. In line with the undertaking which the Commission accepted before the European Parliament in 2007, a report on the implementation of the Barcelona objectives was presented in October 2008. In the report, the Commission spoke about why it is important to invest more in childcare facilities.\nThe Commission noted mainly that the Barcelona objectives are aimed at eliminating obstacles to accessing the labour market, especially for women. More than 6 million women in the EU (aged from 25 to 49) say that they are unable to work or can work only part-time because of family obligations. The European economy is thereby deprived of significant productive potential, and this at a time when it must confront serious economic and demographic challenges, and when the social position of families is thereby weakened. The development of childcare facilities for pre-school age children will enable families to decide freely how to organise their time and how to achieve a better work-life balance. The aim is not to 'force' parents to send their children to these facilities. The aim is to offer this option to parents who want it. The development of childcare services will also contribute to the prevention of poverty, especially for single-parent families, more than a third of whom face the thr", "Situation in Kenya (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statements from the Council and the Commission concerning the situation in Kenya.\nJanez Lenar\u010di\u010d\nPresident-in-Office. - (SL) I am very pleased that today the European Parliament is going to discuss the situation in Kenya and also debate the proposed resolution on the current situation there.\nThe mere fact that the European Parliament sent the Election Observation Mission under the leadership of Mr Lambsdorff, and its own delegation led by Mr Mulder, gave a very important sign that the European Parliament is interested in the situation in Kenya.\nThe elections in Kenya, as we know, took place on 27 December. The high turnout of the Kenyan voters is proof of the commitment of the Kenyan people to the democratic process and of the trust in that process.\nThe European Union Election Observation Mission was present at the actual location and was led by Mr Lambsdorff. It warned of numerous irregularities in the counting and recording of the votes during these elections. These irregularities are causing serious doubts about the actual outcome of these elections. As we know, after the results were published, violence broke out in the capitol Nairobi and other parts of Kenya.\nSupporters of the opposition leader, Mr Odinge, clashed several times with the security forces and also attacked the followers of President Kibaki. Shots were fired by the security forces into the masses. According to Louise Arbour, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the security forces responded \"with excessive violence\u201d.\nAt least 600 people lost their lives and almost a quarter of a million people were displaced - all this in Kenya, a country to which refugees from the neighbouring countries, Somalia and southern Sudan, usually flee.\nIt has affected the economy not only of Kenya itself, but also of the neighbouring countries, especially those without their own access to the sea. That is a tragedy. At the same time it is a great ", "Erasmus Mundus programme (2009-2013) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs De Sarnez on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing an action programme for the enhancement of quality in higher education and the promotion of intercultural understanding through cooperation with third countries (Erasmus Mundus) (2009-2013. - C6-0228/2007 - 2007/0145)COD)]\nMarielle De Sarnez\nrapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, this evening we are debating the Erasmus Mundus 2009-2013 programme, on which we have finally come to an agreement with the Council. It will therefore be possible for this programme to enter into force in January 2009 and thus to benefit students starting from the beginning of the academic year in September. Here I would like to thank all my fellow Members who were draftsmen of opinions at the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, the Committee on Budgets, the Committee on Development and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, as well as my fellow Members on the Committee on Culture and Education. I would, of course, like to thank the European Commission. I would also like to thank the president of the Erasmus Mundus Association and the executive agencies that have been able to help us with their expert knowledge and, above all, their experience.\nFive years after the adoption of Erasmus Mundus, almost to the day, I am happy to be presenting to you this second-generation programme whose objective remains the promotion of excellence in European higher education, enabling the most talented students from non-EU countries and from Europe to follow high-level joint programmes in at least three universities and to benefit from a high-quality welcome and significant scholarships.\nThe previous programme's figures speak for themselves: between 2004 and 2008, 103 Master's courses were selected and approved, over 6", "\n\nAntonio Tajani (PPE-DE ). \u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0 Madam\u00a0President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to inform this Assembly that an attack took place this morning in Nassiriya, Iraq, against a European military convoy: three Italian and a Romanian solider were killed. I believe that this House should remember the sacrifice made by those European citizens, who were doing their jobs and their service in order to promote peace. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, Mr Tajani, and thank you also for informing us of this. I am sure that the House will endorse what you have said. \nMonica Frassoni (Verts/ALE ). \u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0 Madam\u00a0President, ladies and gentlemen, I too agree with Mr Tajani\u2019s remarks, of course, although I would add that it is perhaps really time that those troops left Iraq.\nI have, however, asked to take the floor under Rule 22, which relates to the duties of the Bureau. In particular, I refer to what took place in the Bureau yesterday, when the possibility for Europeans to write to the Community institutions in one of their own country's official languages was rejected. That decision by the Bureau is in no sense an administrative one, given that there would not have been any kind of cost involved for Parliament.\nIt is a political decision and, as such, my group challenges it and intends to bring it up at the Conference of Presidents. A decision such as that, which prevents citizens from communicating in a manner that has already been approved by the Commission and the Council, cannot be adopted by an Assembly like ours. In taking the floor, I simply wanted to explain our position in relation to the duties of the Bureau. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, Mrs Frassoni. Mrs Frassoni has made reference to what emerged from the Bureau meeting last night, with which I am sure not all Members will be familiar.\nMrs Frassoni, I would recommend not only that you write to the President about this matter, but also that you inform your Secretaries-General and your Joint Chairman, and get this raised in the", "Statute of the European Ombudsman (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Anneli J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament amending its Decision 94/262/ECSC, EC, Euratom, of 9 March 1994, on the regulations and general conditions governing the performance of the Ombudsman's duties.\nAnneli J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki\nrapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Diamandouros, ladies and gentlemen, first I wish to thank all parties for their excellent levels of cooperation whilst this report was being produced. It was not easy finding a solution that would satisfy everyone, and I understand that some people are still hoping for some changes, but we have achieved a unanimous result in committee. It seems appropriate to move forward from here.\nThere were four issues relating to the role of Ombudsman. These were access to documents, the testimonials of officials, information on criminal cases, and cooperation in the field of human rights. There was also a fifth issue in the European Ombudsman's original proposal, his or her power to intervene, but this was contentious and right at the end of the discussion the Ombudsman said that he wanted to withdraw it.\nThe most important amendment concerns the obligation of the EU institutions and bodies also to grant the Ombudsman access to classified information and sensitive documents, if deemed necessary for the Ombudsman to do his or her job. Up till now the institutions have had the right to refuse to disclose information. This will now be the subject of objective, and no longer subjective or arbitrary, consideration. This is an important, albeit small, step in the right direction.\nThe institutions supplying classified information or documents to the Ombudsman must inform the Ombudsman of their classified status. Furthermore, for the rules to be implemented, the Ombudsman may agree with the relevant institutions the operational conditions for acces", "2. Ban on the elections for the Tibetan government in exile in Nepal\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolution on the ban on the elections for the Tibetan government in exile in Nepal.\nJaroslav Pa\u0161ka\nMr President, I believe we have all been following with approval and admiration the efforts of the Tibetan people to win the right to run their own country. The many attempts of the government in exile or the Dalai Lama, spiritual leader of the Tibetans, to find a sensible solution through negotiation with the Chinese ruling power, have always ended in failure. The Chinese clearly do not regard the Tibetans as partners in a shared state, but as an obstacle preventing them from taking full possession of an occupied territory.\nThe position of the Nepalese Government is therefore complicated. On the one hand, it must comply with its international obligations and guarantee universal rights to the Tibetan community, but on the other, it cannot disregard the opinion of its enormous neighbour. The position of the Nepalese Government vis-\u00e0-vis the elections to the Tibetan Government in exile clearly tells us who is the real global player in this region. For the Nepalese Government, it is China.\nWe Europeans can make symbolic gestures and declare our reservations regarding the weak Nepalese Government. However, if we really want to bring about a change the position of the Tibetan people, our partner in the dialogue must be the Chinese Government, as it is the political leader in the region, influencing the rules of regional politics. We can, of course, make a declaration to the Nepalese Government, but that will not solve the problem.\nCharles Tannock\nauthor. - Mr President, since the abolition of the Nepalese monarchy and the election of a Maoist-led government in Kathmandu, Nepal and China have inevitably grown much closer. It is no surprise, therefore, that the Nepalese authorities prevented Tibetan refugees living in Nepal from voting for a prime min", "\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, I should like to welcome you to the last sitting of 1998.\n\nApproval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nMiller\nMadam President, I would like to make a comment on the Minutes concerning the Oostlander report. I congratulate the newly elected Member from Scotland on his contribution to the debate on racism and xenophobia. However, may I ask whether he would be prepared, along with myself, to condemn those narrow-minded nationalists who continue to utter and perpetrate racist comments within his own party against English people?\n\nPresident\nIt may be the last sitting before Christmas, but that is nevertheless not on the Minutes, Mr Miller.\nMr Wijsenbeek has the floor.\n\nWijsenbeek\nYou need have no worries about saying 'Wijsenbeek', Madam President.

Madam President, I am referring to the Minutes, pages 11, 12 and 13. I referred to this yesterday. Mr Elles, the rapporteur from the Committee on Budgetary Control, and the President both pointed out that they found our Rules of Procedure strange. May I assume, Madam President, that as a result of this, the presidency of the House, if not the Bureau, will provide us with a proposal to amend Annex V of the Rules of Procedure? Should not the Bureau have spoken of this much sooner and therefore have raised it much earlier in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, rather than convening us on a Monday afternoon in a kind of emergency procedure, when we could no longer of course do anything about it.\nPresident\nWe take note of that.\n\nTheato\nMadam President, I should like to endorse what Mr Wijsenbeek has just said. In the Committee on Budgetary Control, I pointed out at a very early stage that there were incompatibilities here.

He is in Ireland on personal business.\n\nPresident.\nThe final draft agenda, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 19 September 2002 pursuant to Rules 110 and 110a of Parliament's Rules of Procedure, has been distributed. The following change has been proposed:\nWednesday:\nI have received a request from the Confederal Group of the European Left/Nordic Green Left to bring forward the Council and Commission statements on the Middle East.\n\nWurtz (GUE/NGL).\nMr President, I think this is a matter of common sense. Anyone who follows my group's activities knows how important the International Criminal Court is to us. After the events that have just taken place in Ramallah, however, with the bombing and besieging of the Palestinian Authority's headquarters, this matter must clearly be our priority. The suggestion you have just mentioned, namely starting Wednesday afternoon with the statements on the Middle East, is therefore particularly welcome.\n\nBar\u00f3n Crespo (PSE).\nMr President, my group agrees with the modification of the agenda proposed by the GUE/NGL Group. However, given the seriousness of the events taking place, I would firstly like to add that we support the statement of the High Representative for the CFSP, Mr Solana, of 20 September; secondly, I would ask you - since no specific resolution on this issue is scheduled - to communicate, on behalf of Parliament, the resolution approved in April; and, thirdly, in the current circumstances, my group believes that the two hopeful amendments to the Brok report on the situation in the Middle East should be withdrawn.\n\nPresident.\nI note your point about the resolution of April.\n\nSalafranca S\u00e1nchez-Neyra (PPE-DE).\nMr President, I simply wish to say, on behalf of my group, that we are happy with this change to the agenda, since we believe that, furthermore, this change will al", "Explanations of vote\nPresident\nWe now come to the explanations of vote.\nOral explanations of vote\nMonika Fla\u0161\u00edkov\u00e1 Be\u0148ov\u00e1\n(SK) Madam President, I voted in favour of the resolution jointly submitted by the Group of European Socialists mainly for the reason that little has changed in terms of the importance and topicality of the resolution, even though certain changes have occurred in Hungary between the drafting of the resolution and today's vote on it.\nIn the first place, I would like to stress our disappointment over the fact that the Commission decided from the outset to focus on just three areas in relation to the controversial Hungarian media law. We are insistent that, after the Hungarian Government and Parliament had dealt with these three areas in a relatively acceptable way, the Commission should have continued by closely monitoring the compliance of the Hungarian media law with European legislation - specifically, the Charter of Fundamental Rights in particular.\nWe would also like to call on the Hungarian authorities, in future amendments to the law, to engage to a greater degree with the parties involved, including civil society, because that is the only way a law can be drawn up in a truly democratic country. In this way, the contributions and recommendations will surely be stimulating, whether ours - those of the European Parliament, the Commission, or the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe - or those of the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights.\nHannu Takkula\n(FI) Madam President, surely all those in this House who endorse the principles of the European Union think that freedom of the media is very important. This freedom, of course, entails responsibility. I nevertheless voted against this proposal.\nThe information which I have received regarding this matter and which has been gone through here shows that the Commission made requests to Hungary, Hungary responded to them and it amended its media laws accordingly.

We have not managed to do so. Now the intergroups have to meet on an unsuitable date. They almost never have rooms and they never have interpretation.\nI am speaking today not only as the Chair of the Intergroup on Poverty and Human Rights, but with a mandate from the majority of the intergroups in this House, and therefore from the Members of this House who are part of those intergroups. I formally ask the Conference of Presidents to reconsider and to revoke the decision of 14 February 2008, going back to the previous situation of giving freedom to the intergroups.\nIf it does not do so, I would like to say respectfully that we will bring the matter to Parliament's plenary session, which will decide who is sovereign in this House, which is Parliament.\nEvgeni Kirilov\n(BG) Today marks the 85th anniversary of the Treaty of Angora between Bulgaria and Turkey. This deals with the issue of the property rights of almost 350 000 Thracian Bulgarians, who were forcibly driven out of Turkey at the start of the last century. Some of them are still alive, while their descendants number almost 800 000.\nThe issue of the seized Thracian property has been discussed on numerous occasions by both countries, including at the highest level and in working groups, but without any result. Turkey regards these people as displaced persons, but numerous historical facts and documents, including the 1926 League of Nations Protocol on the refugee loan for Bulgaria, prove their refugee status.\nPrime Minister Erdo\u011fan already made one suggestion - people who have documents of ownership should appeal to the Turkish courts. Such documents exist, but it is obscene to demand them of people who have died and barely escaped with their lives.

Scientists and decision-makers from more than 60 countries participated in the World Science Forum, including four Heads of State, the Director-General of UNESCO and the Commission's Environment [...] (interjection: I am sorry, Mr President, but I cannot carry on like this!).\nAs L\u00e1szl\u00f3 S\u00f3lyom, President of the Republic of Hungary, recommended the creation of a world environment organisation in his address, the leaders of the United Nations Environment Programme announced the formation of a new international organisation. It was recommended at the World Forum that the parliaments of as many countries as possible should establish the institution of a commissioner responsible for future generations.\nThe main message of the World Forum is that science and politics must act together to halt climate change and the destruction of the environment. According to the participants, a 'scientific Davos' has been created in Budapest, in other words, Budapest is now for science what Davos is for economic issues.\nThe next event in the series will be in 2009, when it is intended to host the world's science, education and finance ministers in Budapest, as the main event of the Year of Creativity. I would like to ask the Commission and you to support the event and the concept behind it, that is to say, we must defend ourselves and future generations as well as the environment and sustainability. Thank you for the floor, Mr President.\nEluned Morgan\nMr President, one of the greatest problems in relation to EU policy is implementation. This is particularly true in relation to directives relating to Lisbon and climate change.\nOn 4 January 2006 the energy performance of the Buildings Directive should have been implemented in all Member States.

[COM (2001) 53 - C5-0342/2001 - 2001/2142(COS)];\nA5-0142/2002 by Paul Lannoye, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the Commission communication to the European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the regions entitled 'Towards a global partnership for sustainable development? [COM (2002) 82- C5-0173/2002 - 2002/2074(COS)].\n\nPapayannakis (GUE/NGL)\nMr President, the subject of this debate is sustainable development and the political message which Parliament wants to send out - both itself and via the European Union as a whole - to the Johannesburg Summit next August, ten years after Rio.\nIt would be very tempting to list the issues and problems of sustainable development and the future of sustainable development at length, but there is just such a list in the report and in the resolution proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. So I shall refrain from doing so. I mainly want to explain the logic behind the political message we want to send out.\nSo let us begin with the bottom line and the bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, 10 years after Rio, is clearly in the red. With the exception of Kyoto, no progress has been made either with the environment per se - in fact there have been setbacks - or with the state of the world in general. Poverty has not been eradicated or reduced; on the contrary it is rising and we know full well that, with so many people living below the poverty line, there is no point in talking about protecting productive resources, renewable sources of energy ", "Implementation of Goldstone recommendations on Israel/Palestine (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on the implementation of Goldstone recommendations on Israel/Palestine.\nDiego L\u00f3pez Garrido\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (ES) Mr President, I would like to thank the European Parliament for the opportunity to speak on this issue of the fact-finding mission, a mission sponsored by the United Nations, on the conflict in Gaza, which took place between the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009, and is known as the 'Goldstone report'.\nThe United Nations took careful note of the statement by its Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, to the Security Council on 21 January 2009, in which he gave his impressions following a visit to Gaza and South Israel just after the hostilities ended.\nIn addition, the report that has already been referred to in some of the speeches on the previous item, the Goldstone report, which was published in the middle of September last year, was debated in the 12th Session of the Human Rights Council, from 14 September to 2 October.\nFrom the very beginning of this conflict, the European Union has insisted that the parties fully respect human rights and comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law.\nThe European Union made it clear that it would closely monitor the investigations into the accusations and violations of human rights.\nIn Geneva, the Swedish Presidency of the Council established the European Union's position in the following way: firstly, the European Union considers the report to be serious, as it contains reports of serious violations of international humanitarian law, including deliberate attacks on civilians. Secondly, the European Union stresses the importance of adequate and credible investigations being conducted into the possible violations of international law by the parties to the conflict, in line with international legislation and therefore ensuring that the mission", "Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting\nPresident\nThe Minutes of the sitting of 25 March 2010 and the documents which were adopted are available for viewing. The Minutes have been approved.\nFrancesco Enrico Speroni\n(IT) Mr President, you have remembered the victims of the attacks in Russia.\nOnly recently terrorist attacks also took place in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, countries which - like Russia - are outside the European Union. I think it is only right that we remember those victims too.\nPresident\nYou are right, Mr Speroni. I agree. With these introductory words, we in the European Parliament also refer to events of this kind which are happening throughout the world. We remember all victims with great pain. We also sympathise with the victims' families and friends, and with the countries where these things happen. However, this was an exceptional case, because such things have not happened in Russia itself for a long time. This is why I mentioned it. However, you are absolutely right, Mr Speroni. We should remember that every week, throughout the world, there are many very depressing cases of this kind. This is why our work in Europe, in the European Union, makes so much sense, and this is why we can be glad that it has been possible to solve many of these problems in our Europe, although we still have not solved them all. Thank you, Mr Speroni, for pointing this out to me. Thank you very much.\n", "Advanced therapy medicinal products (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Mikol\u00e1\u0161ik on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on advanced therapy medicinal products and amending Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 C6-0401/2005.\nG\u00fcnter Verheugen\nMr President, honourable Members, I am very glad that we are able today to talk about the regulation on medicinal products for advanced therapies, which has been long awaited, and is of enormous importance to innumerable sick people in Europe, to many of whom these new therapies offer hope of new and life-saving treatment. I am not talking here about the common cold, but about such conditions as cancer, Parkinson's disease, AIDS, and other dreadful scourges. So far, no single legal framework has been put in place, with the consequence that many patients are not in a position to benefit from the treatments that are available, or they end up being prescribed medications that are not safe. By means of this regulation, we are preparing the way for easier and safer access to the ones that will save their lives.\nThe proposal is also of great importance for Europe as a centre for research. With things as they stand at present, European researchers and manufacturers - who are often small and medium-sized enterprises - can neither grow nor hold their own in international competition.\nLet me now say something about the legislative process. While it is self-evidently a matter for your House as to how the procedure is handled, I would, however, ask you to bear with me as I appeal to you to come to a decision and to refrain from dragging the process out any longer, in view of the need to create unambiguous conditions for these innovative therapies, for which people have been waiting for so long, and it is for that reason that I am all the more pleased that three groups have put forward a compre", "14. Human rights in the world 2008 and the EU's policy on the matter (\n- Before the vote\nHartmut Nassauer\n(DE) Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats I would like to ask you, pursuant to Article 151(1) and (3), to reject Amendment 45a, tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, as inadmissible insofar as it deals with the statement made by Pope Benedict for the following reasons. First, this statement was made in 2009, while the report deals with human rights violations that took place in 2008. This amendment does not therefore amend the text it is intended to amend. Second, this amendment compares the statements made by the Pope with human rights violations of the most serious kind, the use of the death penalty, human rights violations in China, and torture everywhere. This comparison shows a cynical disregard for the victims of human rights violations throughout the world.\n(Applause)\nThird, it is such an unbelievable aspersion, such an unbelievable discrimination against the Pope that the ALDE Group may well be identified with it, but under no circumstances should the European Parliament be.\n(Loud applause)\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, I am going to give you the opinion of the legal service and of the President of the European Parliament, since he has of course been consulted in accordance with our Rules of Procedure.\nDaniel Cohn-Bendit\n(FR) Mr President, I just wanted to say, on a legal note, to Mr Nassauer, that the Pope does not count the years, for he counts eternity.\nPresident\nPlease, please ... The legal service has checked this carefully, from a technical perspective, from the perspective of the elements mentioned, from a content perspective and from the perspective of the period under examination.\nThe legal service is of the opinion that the amendment is admissible, and this is also the opinion of the President of the European Parliament. It is there", "Preparation of the Eurozone summit of 11 March 2011 (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is a statement by the President of the Commission on the preparation of the Eurozone summit of 11 March 2011 (2011/2615/RSP)).\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso\nMadam President, honourable Members, we are currently experiencing one of those incredible moments when the historical process seems to speed up. On our doorstep, on the other side of the Mediterranean, a wind of freedom has started to blow.\nThis is such an important and urgent matter that I should first of all like to tell you that the College has just approved the Commission's contribution to assist the countries south of the Mediterranean in their transition process and to breathe new life into our relations with our Mediterranean neighbours. I shall present this contribution with Baroness Ashton during the Extraordinary European Council next Friday.\nThe men and women on the southern shores of the Mediterranean, especially the young people, are currently demonstrating their rejection of authoritarian regimes and their aspiration to political freedom and social justice.\nAlthough we are aware of the extreme complexity of the situation and the challenges and difficulties that it presents, the European Union cannot afford any ambiguity. We must stand shoulder to shoulder with those who are demanding political freedom and respect for human dignity. We cannot countenance any ambiguity on the part of the European Union. A regime which fires on its own people has no place within the concert of nations.\nWe are offering these peoples a 'partnership for democracy and shared prosperity' founded on three pillars: democratic transformation, involvement with civil society and mutually supportive development.\nWe are aware of the challenges that await us. Saying no to dictatorship does not automatically guarantee the rule of law and democracy. The road to democratic transition is never an easy one. It can sometimes be winding and it is always demandin", "3. Executions in Libya\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on executions in Libya.\nCharles Tannock\nauthor. - Mr President, personally I have never taken an absolutist stance with regard to the death penalty, but surely it should only ever be countenanced in a handful of the most extreme and egregious criminal cases where the conviction is by due process and beyond all doubt.\nHowever, I have very little confidence in the Libyan judicial system under the arbitrary and dictatorial nature of Muammar al-Gaddafi's regime. He remains a dictator who controls his people through coercion and is intolerant of any dissent; that makes a mockery of Libya's recent election to the UN Human Rights Council.\nNevertheless he exercises leverage over the EU and the West in general through his control of Libya's vast oil reserves. This important economic relationship notwithstanding, I do hope that the Commission will continue to raise at every opportunity the grave concerns we have in this House about human rights and fundamental freedoms in Libya.\nWe all remember the infamous case of the Bulgarian nurses in Libya who were at one point sentenced to death before being finally released after much pleading from this House and the French President's wife. We have a duty to do all we can to protect EU citizens from ever facing a similar situation in the future.\nRa\u00fcl Romeva i Rueda\nauthor. - (FR) Mr President, we should welcome this resolution on the 18 executions that have taken place in Libya, and obviously condemn the death penalty in that country while urging the Libyans to make progress towards a moratorium; we should also ask for transparency and statistics. We should remember, however, that the names of those executed have not been disclosed and that those 18 people included some non-Libyan nationals.\nWe must welcome this resolution, which addresses the issue of refugees, Libya's flawed policy regarding the protection of migrants, and the responsibility of Member States with regard to", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nJaros\u0142aw Kalinowski\n(PL) Thank you very much, Madam President. In that case, I will start again. In recent years, the European Union economy has often suffered because of crises and financial instability both at local and global levels. In order to prevent similar dangerous situations in the future, pre-prepared support plans must exist, and there must be an appropriate reaction both before and after the problem. The Instrument for Stability fills this role very well.\nFinancial and technical support should also include the promotion of human and economic development as well as consultations in the event of the violation of human rights, democracy and fundamental freedoms. I also support the position of the rapporteur on improvement of the strategic planning sector. This is particularly important in the prevention of social conflicts and in the creation of the External Action Service.\nTunne Kelam\n- Mr President, having voted for the Brantner report, I would like to use this opportunity to turn the Commission's and Council's attention to the need to reach a tripartite agreement on the modification of the stability instrument in the shortest possible time.\nThe disputed issue relates to the delegated acts and Parliament's options to exercise its rightful scrutiny over the use of the EU's financial instruments. What we need is a rapid political solution based on balance between the EU's three institutions.\nI would also encourage the Commission to improve its reporting to the European Parliament on such issues as project design, implementation and review.\nWhile Parliament receives information from the Commission on exceptional assistance measures, the Commission's reporting on broader strategic and analytical terms is still falling short of Parliament's expectations.\nJaros\u0142aw Kalinowski\n(PL) The instrument for development cooperation contributes directly to the spread of democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights", "Council Question Time\nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B6-0445/2006).\nThe following questions have been submitted to the Council.\nSubject: Qualified majority for an area of freedom, security and justice, and for immigration\nGiven the delays holding up the coming into force of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, and the prospect of a further enlargement which will make it still more difficult to adopt decisions unanimously, does the Council intend to push ahead with the legal changes required in order that decisions relating to the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice, or at least to immigration, can be taken by qualified majority, since there is an urgent need to develop fresh policies in this area?\nPaula Lehtom\u00e4ki\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council that met last June asked the Finnish Presidency to work closely with the Commission to look into ways of improving decision-making and action in the area of freedom, security and justice on the basis of the current Treaties. The Commission has put forward several proposals for this in its communication 'Implementing the Hague Programme: the way forward'. The proposals are being considered by the European Council, which is expected to return to them at its meeting in December.\nThe main proposal by the Commission for improving the decision-making process relates to the use of the passerelle clause under Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union. That would bring police cooperation and criminal justice within the framework of the Treaty establishing the European Community. The proposal was discussed at the informal meeting of Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs this September, although it did not obtain the unanimous support it needed under Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union. The Presidency will be giving a report on this to the European Council in December.\nI would also ask the honourable Member to note th", "1. European Network and Information Security Agency (\n- Before the vote:\nAngelika Niebler\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are about to vote on extending the duration of ENISA's mandate. Just to remind you, ENISA is the European Network and Information Security Agency, which we, together with the Council, brought into being five years ago. ENISA's mandate expires half-way through next year by rotation. My report proposes extending the mandate by three years, to 2012, which also matches the Council's decision.\nENISA's aim is to contribute to Internet security. However, with the increase in Internet crime, this is not possible with the available staff and the limited funding it gets so that, in the next three years by which we have extended the mandate, we need to think about what tasks ENISA should take on in the future and what role it can play, and then we will need to provide appropriate staff and funding.\nI would ask you all, most urgently, to again approve this three-year extension and then to make an effort to get involved in the debate on the future of this Agency.\n", "Coordinated strategy to improve the fight against fiscal fraud (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Bowles, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on a coordinated strategy to improve the fight against fiscal fraud.\nSharon Bowles\nrapporteur. - Mr President, may I first take this opportunity to thank colleagues for their input, especially on one or two topics where we still have differences of opinion. I think we have more in common than divides us and that we can reach a satisfactory outcome by not straying too far from the core subject.\nThe broad principles underlying this report on fiscal fraud are simple, and only fraudsters themselves would disagree. The tax losses due to fraud are difficult to assess. Fraudsters and tax evaders take care to hide their activity from the tax authorities, but estimates put the level of fraud at EUR 200-250 billion or 2-2.5% of the total GDP of the EU.\nMy question is, do we put 2-2.5% of our collective effort into resolving it? Since the answer to that question is clearly no, there can only be one conclusion. It needs more effort, more attention and in particular it needs more collective cooperative attention by Member States.\nNow VAT fraud, particularly the missing trade or carousel fraud, may be the largest single cause of tax loss. It comes about simply because of the loophole in the arrangements for VAT under which it is not levied on cross-border intra-Community trade. So VAT-free purchases can be sold on, the VAT pocketed and then the trader vanishes. In complex carousels innocent traders can get enmeshed, and measures within Member States to combat fraud, such as freezing rebates, can damage innocent businesses. This is a well-known problem in my own country, the United Kingdom. So that is all the more reason to tackle the problem at its root.\nPragmatically VAT will have to remain a consumption tax based on accruing to the fiscal authority of final destination. The report proposes that", "Eligibility of housing interventions in favour of marginalised communities (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the report by Lambert van Nistelrooij, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, concerning draft Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (EC) No .../2009, amending Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006, on the European Regional Development Fund as regards the eligibility of housing interventions in favour of marginalised communities\n- C7-0095/2009 -\nLambert van Nistelrooij\nThe European Parliament is dynamic; from fish and CITES we move onto humans, because it is also important that they, too, are dealt with in a responsible manner. I am glad that we are able to amend the European Regional Development Fund Regulation today in relation to housing people in difficult circumstances, marginalised groups throughout the Union.\nI am also glad that we managed to reach agreement last week in the first reading on a whole range of problems that arose in a legal sense within the framework of the Treaty of Lisbon. Together, we have come up with a wording for the first amendment of legislation under the Treaty of Lisbon, the first amendment of legislation in this new parliamentary term. A whole range of other proposals have been blocked, but this proposal will make it. I also thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for the pressure you exerted. Together, we have said, 'This was actually already an agreement under the Treaty of Nice'. However, there was not enough progress. It was linked to other areas, which is why an agreement was not reached under the Swedish Presidency.\nThere is also talk of a new situation this year, because 2010 is the European year of the fight against poverty and social exclusion, the best year by far to bring this type of instrument into being. Together with others, I have therefore exercised great pressure to have this area completed, and just in time, I would say.\nI am also glad and content, however, that the projects ", "Preparation of the European Council, including the situation of the global financial system (continuation of debate) \nJos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso\nPresident of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, Mr Jouyet, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to make an assessment of the role of the French Presidency of the Council.\nAs Mr Jouyet has just said, in the midst of the French Presidency of the Council, first there was the crisis between Russia and Georgia and now there is an unprecedented crisis, this global financial crisis. It is a crisis that did not originate in Europe - it came from across the Atlantic - and it is a crisis for which we do not yet, and I stress 'yet', have the necessary rules in Europe that would enable us to give a typically European response. I can bear witness to the tremendous efforts the French Presidency and Nicolas Sarkozy have made to find a European response to this emergency.\nThe gravity of the financial crisis is clear to all of us and it is absolutely right that it should be at the core of the European Council meeting next week.\nAddressing this crisis is an important test for the financial sector, for the Member States, for Europe and its institutions and for the international financial institutions. There is a wide variety of players involved - banks and other financial institutions, supervisors, the ECB and other central banks, the national governments, the Commission - so we need coordination. And events are moving very quickly - so we need speed.\nLast week I called for a coordinated European response, because I am convinced that, without it, it will be much harder for Europe to overcome this crisis. Today I am encouraged by the determination of Member States to work together, as demonstrated by the statement of the 27 leaders of the Member States and myself on Monday, the Eurogroup and the Ecofin meetings. But I am not yet satisfied - we can and we must do more.\nIn particular I urge Member States to make a real effort at coordinatio", "\nHelmer\nMr President, on a point of order. I understand that the first point of order ever raised in the directly-elected Parliament in 1979 was by the Reverend Doctor Ian Paisley and his point was that the British flag was flying upside-down. Twenty-one years later I have to tell you that yesterday evening in the forecourt in front of the Tower building, where the motorcyclists were collecting, there were sixteen flags flying. Fifteen of them were the right way up but the Union flag was upside-down. To fly the Union flag upside-down is an internationally recognised distress signal and to fly it upside-down when it is not a distress signal is a gross affront to the flag, the British people and the British nation.\nI have corresponded with the President of our Parliament on this issue and she has written to me assuring me that this matter would be corrected and that the British flag would be flown the right way up. Can I now call upon you first of all to ensure that the flag is immediately placed the right way up and also to take measures to ensure that in future it is always displayed correctly.\n\nPresident\nI can assure you, Mr Helmer, that everything will be done to ensure that the prestige of your flag is restored.\n\nChichester\nMr President, I have news for Mr Helmer, which should encourage him. He should be grateful that we see our Union flag up at all. I am advised that it is the most popular flag to be stolen in this place.\n\nGoebbels\nMr President, last year, the majority of MEPs in this House voted in favour of Friday morning sittings. Recently, however, a certain number of MEPs have, here in Strasbourg, attempted to prevent other MEPs from working during these sittings: I denounce this very undemocratic attitude, especially as those who did not want others to work were still receiving their per diem.\nI should also like to say this.

I voted in your favour, Commissioner, and I am sure I was right to do so.\nThe directive on inland transport of dangerous goods updates four Commission decisions and combines them in a single legal act. It includes in its scope the transport of dangerous goods by inland waterways, which has not been covered by EU legislation to date. The proposal also incorporates international rules for the transport of dangerous goods into Community law and extends their application to national transport. It is to be hoped that a high level of safety will be ensured as a result, whilst improving inter-modality in the transport of dangerous goods.\nI should like to recall that at first reading Parliament adopted 42 amendments. Essentially, these amendments provided that Member States that have no railway system are exempt from the obligation to transpose and implement this directive. The amendments also introduced a transitional period of two years to prepare for effective implementation of these provisions. In addition, the principle was introduced whereby the Member States may lay down specific requirements concerning the national and international transport of dangerous goods within their territory to take account of the specific nature of road vehicles, carriages and inland waterway vessels. Member States may also prescribe certain routes or specific modes of transport and lay down special rules for the transport of dangerous goods on their te", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nJanssen van Raay\nOne last word on the Minutes, concerning the Kai Islands, the eastern part of the Moluccan archipelago, Ambon itself, Ujung Pandang on Sulawesi, where Christian minorities have little or no protection against armed gangs. The Moluccans urgently need help. The case I am bringing, which you my colleagues endorsed in the run-up to Luxembourg, concerns financial penalties and roll-call voting. My main point is that it is for Members, not the administration, to decide Parliament's priorities. If I win my case, then all the fines wrongfully collected will have to be refunded, and you wished my colleagues luck with that yesterday, Mr President, for which I am grateful.\n\nPresident\nWe take note of that and it will be checked.\n\nWynn\nMr President, under Item 19 of the Minutes on the discharge, it mentions that I had a report on the EDF but when you look at the speakers' list you will see that I did not speak. Trying to be in two places at the same time is not an easy job. As coordinator for the Socialist Group I was still in the Committee on Budgets discussing the interinstitutional agreement. Therefore, I would like to apologise to Parliament for not being here to present my report and also to thank Mrs Theato for moving it during the debate.\n\nTindemans\nMr President, I have just got here only to find that my voting card is missing from the machine.\nI would point out that I am in the right place, as ever.\n\nPresident\nI think you will be able to obtain a replacement card without delay, Mr Tindemans. In any event, we shall check whether there is anyone voting with a card in your name.\n\nTheato\nMr President, Item 18 of the Minutes - the debate on the European Fraud Investigation Office - is mentioned only very briefly; neither the Council president nor the Members who spoke are mentioned. This is really not normal practice. It only says that Members ", "Explanations of vote\nLaima Liucija Andrikien\nMr President, when I spoke during the discussion on the Galina Kozlova case, I expressed my gratitude to our colleagues from the PPE-DE Group Mr Kelam, Mr Landsbergis and Mr Tannock for initiating that resolution. I was informed later that the original initiative came from our Estonian colleague Mr Savi from the ALDE Group. I should therefore like to express my respect and gratitude to him.\nMarcin Libicki\n(PL) On Nigeria, I voted in favour of the resolution tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. I do not consider it a good one, but I believe that adopting the joint resolution tabled by the Left would bring far more discredit on the House. I believe the resolution tabled by the Group of the European People's Party is a better way forward.\nPresident\nI would remind you that there are no explanations of vote concerning emergency matters.\nZbigniew Zaleski\n(FR) Mr President, I would just like to add a word to what Mr Libicki said: the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats's motion was not the result of a compromise.\nPresident\nThat concludes the explanations of vote.\nBefore closing the sitting, I have some more announcements to make.\n", "14. Progress report on Croatia (vote) \n- Swoboda report\n- Before the vote on Amendment 18\nHannes Swoboda \nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, it had been agreed with the shadow rapporteurs that this would read simply 'the Croatian authorities' rather than 'the government and local authorities'.\n(The oral amendment was accepted)\n- Before the vote on Amendment 24\nHannes Swoboda \nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, something else I have to clarify, with the agreement of the shadow rapporteurs, is that this provision is intended to apply to all problems with borders, and so I ask that 'with neighbouring countries' be inserted. This rule that recourse be had to the services of a third party should, then, apply in principle to all border problems that are as yet unresolved.\n(The oral amendment was accepted)\nPresident\nThat concludes the vote.\nReinhard Rack\n(DE) Mr President, might I ask why it is that, since we always have relatively few votes on a Tuesday and always a very large number of them on Wednesdays, why it is that formal sittings are always on Wednesdays? Could we not move them to a Tuesday? That would work every bit as well, and we would be able to organise our timetable far better.\nPresident\nI shall pass your comment on to the right person and try to get you an answer.\n", "Application of Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of EU citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is a short presentation of the report by Mrs V\u0103lean, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the application of Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of EU citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States.\nAdina-Ioana V\u0103lean\nrapporteur. - Mr President, of all the fundamental rights granted to EU citizens, the one that helps unite all of us the most is the right of freedom of movement in the European Union.\nThat right, provided for in the Treaties, is implemented by Directive 2004/38/EC, which lays down both the conditions and the restrictions for EU citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the EU.\nAs of 1 January 2006, over 8 million EU citizens have exercised this right to reside in another Member State, and millions more have used it to travel through the EU.\nAs the European Parliament rapporteur on the evaluation of this Directive, I must say that the concrete application of the right of free movement for our citizens is seriously undermined by Member States which erect dams in breach of the Treaties and of the Directive.\nFirst, talking about the transposition by Member States, we can say it has been poor at best. The Commission, along with two separate studies commissioned by Parliament, points to a series of problems, some of them being breaches of the core rights of EU citizens. These problems are highlighted in my report.\nThere are many unjustified administrative burdens, particularly for third-country-national family members, which include: entry requirements and lengthy procedural delays; a lack of recognition of free movement rights for certain registered partners, including those in same-sex relationships; public policy exceptions", "4. Financing the common agricultural policy (vote) \n- Report: Jorgo Chatzimarkakis\n- Before the final vote:\nReinhard Rack\n(DE) Madam President, in this House, neither the lift system nor the bell is working. That is the reason why many of us did not manage to get here on time, so perhaps we could ask the relevant services to get the bell to actually ring, please.\nPresident\nThe vote was scheduled for 11.00 and we have tried to start on time.\n", "1. The humanitarian situation of Iraqi refugees (vote) \nJoint resolution.\n- Before the vote on the draft resolution:\nAvril Doyle\nMr President, on a point of order, before you put the motion for a resolution to the vote, in the interests of fairness I think the ALDE Group should recognise that but for the PPE-DE Group's presence here this afternoon, its amendments would not have been passed. I think there should be consistency in our criticism about presence in this Chamber.\n", "1. Zimbabwe\nPresident\nThe next item is six motions for a resolution on Zimbabwe.\nErik Meijer\nauthor. - (NL) Mr President, Zimbabwe's President Mugabe was once the hero of the liberation struggle. Thanks to him former Southern Rhodesia gave way to a new state of Zimbabwe which gave a democratic voice to the black majority population, after the end of British colonial rule and in the teeth of a white-led policy of apartheid which rebelled against that colonial authority.\nFor years Mugabe was an incredibly moderate ruler. He did not pursue the pressing imperative of redistributing land ownership. He was radical only in his objection to homosexuals. Only when he was in danger of losing power did he remember his earlier promises about land reform. Since then his ill-considered actions have reduced his country's economy to total ruin. The redistribution of agricultural land did not follow a proper plan, but was done entirely arbitrarily, with his most aggressive supporters grabbing the land for themselves.\nWorse still is the way he has treated his political opponents. They have been relentlessly intimidated and attacked but have so far managed to survive. Last time elections were held there was already the suspicion that the results were rigged. This time the opposition won the parliamentary elections, but it seems that the proposed recount is designed to rob them of their victory. The result of the presidential election has been kept secret for a full month already, so the size of Mugabe's defeat remains unknown.\nIn the last few days he has declared enthusiastically that he will never change anything in his country. He can only make good that promise by violence and oppression. He will do it using a shipload of imported Chinese arms. Given these circumstances it is reasonable for the outside world to concern itself with this domestic conflict. Support for refugees, support for the opposition and pressure on the ruling party are essential ways of achieving what Mugabe him", "Elimination of violence against women (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on:\nthe oral question to the Council on the International Day for the elimination of violence against women by Mrs Svensson, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality - B7-0220/2009),\nthe oral question to the Commission on the International Day for the elimination of violence against women by Mrs Svensson, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality - B7-0220/2009).\nI would remind you that today is the International Day for the elimination of violence against women, and the opportunity to hold this debate is particularly important to us.\nEva-Britt Svensson\nMadam President, today is 25 November, which marks the tenth anniversary of the establishment by the UN of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. Throughout my adult life, I have been politically active in women's organisations and in networks for combating this violence against women. During my work, I think I have used every possible word to describe the situation. I think I have used very many words - we have done so together in this fight. Now I feel that we actually need to see some concrete action.\nThis is a type of violence that robs women of their human rights. It affects and defines women's everyday lives. It is a type of violence that determines the course of the lives and the situations of women and young girls.\nWe all have a responsibility to break the silence and, within Parliament and outside, to cooperate with all of the forces for good to stop this violence. It includes violence within intimate relationships, sexual harassment, physical and mental abuse, rape, murder, the sex slave trade and female genital mutilation. During wars and armed conflicts and during the reconstruction following conflicts, women are subjected to violence to a greater extent, both as individuals and collectively.\nSome people claim that violence within intimate relat", "12. Patients' rights in cross-border healthcare (\n- Before the vote:\nKartika Tamara Liotard\n(NL) I wish to raise a point of order based on Article 168(2). Our group has submitted an amendment on the change in the legal base, and a number of other groups have done likewise. The change means that now only Article 95 on the internal market, and thus only economic interests, are included as a legal base and not Article 152 on public health, in which the patient is taken as the starting point.\nIn principle, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety asked for an opinion from the Committee on Legal Affairs, but the opinion was requested solely on the basis of the original proposal from the Commission. In the Bowis report, it is now clear that a change has been made whereby patients' rights are also mentioned in this report, and therefore the legal base has also changed. These amendments have, however, been declared inadmissible and therefore the fundamental change which Parliament wishes to make - in other words from an exclusive market orientation to including patients' rights - is in trouble. I would like to ask that the report be referred back to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.\nPresident\nMrs Liotard, we will now vote on Amendment 158, which is a motion for rejection, and once we have that result I will respond to your observation.\nI should like to make a proposal regarding the amendments dealing with the legal base: the Presidency must decide on the admissibility of these amendments, specifically, Amendments 159, 119, 116 and 125, but the decision naturally has to depend on the final configuration of the directive, which will be modified in the course of voting.\nTherefore, I propose that the vote on the admissibility of these amendments should take place at the end, since at that point the Presidency will have the facts it needs to decide whether or not they are admissible. Otherwise, we would have to decide now wit", "Situation in the Mediterranean, in particular in Tunisia and Egypt (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the situation in the Mediterranean, in particular in Tunisia and Egypt.\nCatherine Ashton\nVice-President of the Commission/ High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, we have all been watching very closely the recent events in Tunisia and more lately in Egypt.\nThe people in both countries have voiced legitimate grievances and aspirations and they expect a proper response not only from within their countries but also from their partners, including the European Union. Their message is clear: their political systems have reached a point of no return, and change must come now.\nI take this opportunity to express my admiration for their dignity and courage and, in the light of what we are seeing now on our television screens from Egypt in particular, I call for calm and restraint and dialogue.\nI am going to begin by talking about Tunisia. The changes that have taken place have been remarkable and have paved the way for more democratic development of the country. Despite many challenges, we can already see the positive developments in Tunisia, where efforts have been made to meet the demands of the population. The transitional government has taken some important steps, in particular by freeing political prisoners and allowing freedom of expression, as well as prosecuting members of former President Ben Ali's family for corruption.\nFurthermore, three independent commissions have been set up and have begun their work: the Commission for inquiry into corruption and misuse of public funds; the Commission for inquiry into abuses during the repression in the course of the latest events; and the High Commission for Political Reform.\nI have taken note too of the most recent government reshuffle in resp", "1. Advanced therapy medicinal products (vote) \n- Mikol\u00e1\u0161ik report\n- Before the vote\nMiroslav Mikol\u00e1\u0161ik \nrapporteur. - Mr President, as rapporteur I would like to take this opportunity to make a clarification in introducing this report.\nI wish to condemn and strongly oppose the behaviour of some of my shadow rapporteur colleagues who, by bypassing the rapporteur and presenting block one as a so-called compromise with the Council, are undermining the role of Parliament.\nThere are eight political groups in this House, but only three groups - the PSE, ALDE and GUE/NGL - have agreed on these over 70 amendments. We have not been informed by the Council that COREPER has accepted this package. I therefore urge you to vote to reject block one and support block two, which is the result of the work done by the parliamentary committees.\nHowever, at the same time I should like to state clearly that I will listen to the voice of this House, and that as the main rapporteur I will give my definitive support to this proposal.\nDagmar Roth-Behrendt\nMr President, I simply want to stress that I myself, and members of some of the other political groups, used their democratic right to table amendments in due time. I wish to underline that all of the amendments in block one reflect the votes in committee and are in line with an agreement reached in a technical trialogue with the rapporteur, who then decided not to continue with that trialogue. We did not exceed our powers in relation to any of those items and I would propose that we proceed to the vote. I always respect the democratic procedures applicable here.\n(Applause)\nBefore the vote on Amendment 66\nHartmut Nassauer\n(DE) Mr President, I do not believe that Amendment 66 is covered by the compromise amendment, and would be grateful if we could have an additional vote on that.\nPresident\nAccording to the analysis that has been done, Amendment 66 is covered by Amendment 127, which deals with derogations for hospitals. Therefore, we believe", "Pharmaceutical products package (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the pharmaceutical products package.\nG\u00fcnter Verheugen\nMadam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposals in the so-called pharmaceutical package which I am presenting this evening at Parliament's request have a common theme. The intention of the package is to strengthen the rights, needs and interests of patients in our healthcare systems.\nIn our view patients are not merely the subject of services available from healthcare providers or the subject of the financial interests of the pharmaceutical industry. Patients are responsible citizens whose health is their most important asset and who are entitled to have the best and safest treatments and medicines at their disposal. Patients are the subject of healthcare policy.\nHowever, health or restoration to health is not just a right. It also involves an obligation to take care of oneself by eating healthily, having a healthy lifestyle and playing an active role in one's own treatment, if treatment is required.\nOur proposal for more effective monitoring of the actual effects of approved medicines, for example, presupposes this type of active involvement on the part of patients. If patients do not notify the authorities about anomalies relating to medicines that they have taken, the monitoring process will be a waste of time.\nThis also applies to protection against counterfeit medicines. Patients can, and should, in future ensure that they are not taking fake medicines by checking that all the safety features which will be required on future packaging are in fact in place. If we believe that active, informed patients play an essential role in healthcare, in monitoring medicines and in preventing the spread of counterfeits, it is hard to understand why patients are not allowed access to information about the most important medicines. For this reason, the pharmaceutical package consists of the following four parts: a political", "Quorum\nPresident\nI am pleased to see that the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is here, because we have a delicate problem to solve. My dear Jo, if you will return to your seat. I will explain the problem that we have, ladies and gentlemen.\nRule 149 states that we can establish whether a quorum is present. As you know there are always large numbers in Parliament to debate its agenda and adopt the minutes, so in that case no quorum is required. However, Rule 149(3) states that if there is a prior request from at least forty Members, we can establish whether or not the quorum is present.\nI have received a written request from forty Members who want us to verify whether or not the quorum is present. Therefore, obviously... Mr Posselt, please allow me to explain the facts. Obviously I consider that there is indeed a prior request that has been clearly made.\nThe problem is as follows: after that the Rules of Procedure are much vaguer. It does not say anywhere that the forty Members have to be present in the Chamber in order to submit this request for the quorum to be established, but it is also not excluded. I therefore have discretion. On previous occasions, which we have checked, the President of the sitting has always considered that the forty Members had to be in the Chamber in order to give some substance to Rule 149(4), which states that when the quorum is counted, the forty should be counted. That implies that the forty have to be present.\nHowever, I have discretion, and there is also the way in which the request is worded: it concerns the vote on urgencies, which is all the urgencies; not just one of them but all of them. If we consider that the quorum request is admissible and the quorum is not present, all the urgencies will be dropped, and as you know they cannot be deferred. This means that we will not vote on Kashmir, the death penalty or Bangladesh. If we do not vote on them, we will not defer them to the next sitting. Parliament will not", "11. Discrimination against young women and girls in the field of education (vote) \n- Before the vote on recital G:\nZbigniew Zaleski\n(DE) Mr President, I have just a brief statement to make on the amendment.\n(PL) The report refers to many negative aspects of so-called feminism and segregation, and I therefore consider it is worth highlighting a positive example. Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie could serve as an inspiring example of a woman, mother, wife, scientist, Nobel prize-winner and exemplary European. That is why I am surprised that Mrs Flasarov\u00e1, the rapporteur, is opposed to Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie and I cannot understand why. Is it a case of woman against woman? Is it politically and psychologically correct?\n- Before the vote on the amended motion for a resolution:\nV\u011bra Flasarov\u00e1 \nrapporteur. - (CS) Thank you for giving me the floor, Mr President. I feel that in terms of women who have made a significant contribution to our European Union and to Europe, there are too many to name. I therefore feel that it is not only Marie Curie-Sk\u0142odowska, a woman for whom I have great admiration, who should be on the list. This report, in my view, deals with the issues that have been mentioned here. Thank you.\n", "Rising food prices (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on rising food prices.\nJ\u00e1nos Martonyi\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - Madam President, thank you for inviting the Hungarian Presidency to participate in this debate on rising food prices.\nFor a second time in three years, the issue is on the agenda. Once again, rising food prices are causing social unrest and political instability in several countries. Families in the poorest regions of the world are in difficulty. Moreover, the Food and Agriculture Organisation tells us that the outlook is not good, with prices set to rise further this year as a result of adverse climatic conditions. This is a pressing issue. It was discussed between Agriculture Ministers and WTO Director-General Lamy in Berlin on 22 January 2011, and once again in the Agriculture Council on 24 January this year.\nThe reasons for this latest rise in prices are complex and are a mixture of structural and temporary factors. On the demand side, we have more people to feed than ever before. On the supply side, droughts and floods have played their part in wrecking harvests, input costs have risen and this has all been compounded by financial speculation in the commodity markets.\nSo what can the European Union do to address this problem? We need to get our internal policies right, we need to improve global governance in this area and we need to make a real contribution to the most vulnerable. Now is not the time for complacency, but we did make some important progress in all three aspects as a result of the last food prices crisis. The Council, along with Parliament, is engaged in an intensive debate on the future development of the common agricultural policy. This is highly relevant with regard to global food security. Recent Council debates put food security at the centre of the discussion, asking the question how best to ensure that agricultural production in the EU will be both economically viable and ", "12. EU-Africa relations (vote) \n- Martens report\n- Before the vote on Amendment 1\nAlain Hutchinson\n(FR) Mr President, colleagues, I should like very briefly to propose an oral amendment to the new Article 61a in Amendment 1, which would introduce the following wording in the second part: 'therefore calls on the Commission [...] to find solutions while continuing negotiations'. I believe I have the support of my ALDE and PPE colleagues.\n(The oral amendment was adopted.)\n", "Use of PCB waste oils in an Irish food recycling plant (debate) \nPresident\n- The next item is the Commission statement on the use of PCB waste oils in an Irish food recycling plant.\nAndroulla Vassiliou\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission is fully aware of the high risks of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) for human health and the environment.\nIncidents like those in Belgium in 1999, and in Ireland last year, have demonstrated once again that even small amounts of PCBs can cause severe contamination of the feed and food chain.\nOver the past three decades, the EU has established legislation to decrease the release of PCBs and dioxins into the environment, with the objective of reducing human exposure and protecting human health and the environment.\nNevertheless, as equipment containing PCBs typically has a long life expectancy, even after the ban of PCBs in 1985 significant amounts remain in use and are one source of possible human exposure.\nIn particular, the Directive on the disposal of PCBs, Directive 96/59/EC of September 1996, provides the appropriate tools to ensure the disposal of equipment and waste containing PCBs as soon as possible, and for large equipment before the end of 2010.\nHowever, there remain significant gaps in the full implementation of this legislation. The Commission had to launch infringement procedures against most Member States concerning the obligation to establish inventories of large PCB-containing equipment and PCB disposal plans.\nAs a result of these infringement procedures, the overall situation has improved. Currently only two such cases are still open, but are about to be closed.\nAll Member States have communicated their plans for the decontamination and/or disposal of inventoried equipment and the PCBs contained therein, and for the collection and subsequent disposal of equipment containing less than five cubic decimetres of PCBs (as required by Article 11 of the Directive).\nNevertheless, additional efforts are ", "7. Organisation of working time (\n- After the vote:\nAlejandro Cercas\nVery briefly, Mr President, I would first like to thank all my fellow Members and congratulate them on this triumph, which belongs to all the groups in this House. This is a victory for Parliament as a whole.\n(Applause)\nI must thank two million European doctors and a million medical students for the work they have done, and I must also thank the European Trade Union Confederation and all the national trade unions, who have worked so hard.\nMr President, it is important to remind the Council that this is not a setback, but rather an opportunity to rectify a wrong decision. It should see it as an opportunity to bring our agenda closer to that of the citizens. We must ask the Commission to don its referee's outfit and take off the Council shirt that it has been wearing these last three years. Once it has its referee's shirt on, let us go to conciliation, so that reconciling work and family life can become a reality, together with the social Europe.\n(Loud applause)\nJan Andersson\n(SV) I would like to say a sincere thank you to Alejandro and everyone else who has worked on this issue. I do not see the Council here today. We have tried to get negotiations with the Council under way, but they have been unwilling to come to the negotiating table. Now we see a large majority here in Parliament. Let us now come to the table so that we can produce a good Working Time Directive. Now we will know the opinion of Parliament with a large majority.\n", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 18 February 2000.\n\nStatement by the President\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, as you know, on 22 February, ETA struck again in a brutal attack in Spain with the murder of Fernando Buesa Blanco, the General Secretary of the Socialist Party of Vizcaya and the spokesman of the Socialist Party of the Basque Parliament, and Jorge D\u00edez Elorza, his bodyguard. The same day, I conveyed my own and the European Parliament' s deepest sympathy and sincere condolences to the victims' families.\nThese men paid with their lives for their commitment to democracy. I utterly condemn this act of barbarism that is unworthy of any civilised society. The rule of law and the respect of rights and fundamental freedoms are the principles on which the European Union is based. Terrorism, whatever form it takes, is unacceptable. In expressing the hope that these men will be the last victims of ETA, I call on this organisation finally to cease resorting to violence and to use the democratic channels that exist in Spain.\nI would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to observe one minute' s silence in memory of Fernando Buesa Blanco and Jorge D\u00edez Elorza.\n(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)\n\nBar\u00f3n Crespo\nMadam President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I want to thank you for your statement last Tuesday and for your words today in memory of Fernando Buesa Blanco. He was a member of the Basque regional parliament, spokesman for the Socialist Party in that parliament and also a former vice-president of the Basque regional government.\nMadam President, the best tribute that my Group and this House can pay to Fernando Buesa is to take on board his vision, as a European, of the Basque Country, Spain and Europe. The following is a translated extract from his autobiography. 'We are in Europe. Anyone of my age - I am 54 - can remember their grandparents' era a", "Social security systems and pensions (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Stauner, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the future of social security systems and pensions: their financing and the trend towards individualisation.\nGabriele Stauner\nMadam President, ladies and gentlemen, preparing an initiative report on the subject of the future of social security systems and pensions is a fascinating task because this area is so topical and so complex. However, it involves the significant risk of the report becoming a long wish list and catalogue of requirements for all right-thinking people.\nWe did not succumb to this temptation, as the relatively brief and highly technical text, which carefully avoids flowery wording, indicates at first glance. I would therefore like to thank all my fellow Members, in particular the shadow rapporteurs and Mrs Lulling, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, for their self-discipline.\nMy aim was to produce a report which provides a description of the developments over the next 30 to 40 years for all decision makers and interested parties and which offers food for thought and recommendations for action for the individual areas of social policy. Social security and pension systems in the Member States have traditionally been designed, developed and financed in very different ways, which is why it will not be possible to harmonise them at an EU level.\nNevertheless, all of the systems are in difficulty because of demographic developments and the changes to the labour market resulting from globalisation. This means that reforms are necessary in every case. Scientific findings have shown that continuing as before is not an option for any of the existing systems. That is the first important result.\nThe type of reforms needed in each Member State obviously varies depending on the structure of each system. In our opinion, all the systems need,", "Greenhouse gas emission allowance trading system (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Doyle, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2003/87/EC so as to improve and extend the greenhouse gas emission allowance trading system of the Community - C6-0043/2008 -.\nAvril Doyle\nrapporteur. - Mr President, the cost of reducing carbon emissions and decoupling our economies from our fossil fuel dependency will be about 1% of GDP if we act and act decisively over the next 10 years.\nIf we postpone the decisions that we as politicians have been told by peer review scientists are essential to reach the 2\u00b0C maximum increase in global temperature, the cost will be at least 10% of GDP by 2020 and increase steeply as environmental tipping points will be tracked by financial ones.\nYes, energy-efficient and resource-efficient industries are also economically efficient and, yes, revolutionary change in the energy sector is what we need. We have absolutely no choice at all on that matter. The EU is the only region in the world that currently has a functioning emissions trading system and which has put a price on carbon and which is committed to a 20% unilateral reduction in our CO2 emissions.\nEffectively we have been the pilot project for the rest of the world, for other regions. Those other regions were developing their cap-and-trade systems and I look forward to the new US Administration's proposal based on President-elect Obama's election manifesto early in the New Year. It was confirmed to us by Senator John Kerry last week in Pozna\u0144 that it would be no later.\nI also welcome today's draft ETS proposal from the Australian Government, using our ETS as a template, and I sincerely wish them well also.\nI welcome the resolve and intent of the Chinese, the Indians and so many other countries in the industrialised and less-developed parts of", "Protecting children using the Internet and other communication technologies (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Angelilli, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a multiannual Community programme on protecting children using the Internet and other communication technologies - C6-0092/2008 -.\nRoberta Angelilli\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commission, the French Presidency and my fellow MEPs, first and foremost the draftsmen of the opinions, for their hard work in drafting a compromise text at first reading that will enable the 'Safer Internet' programme to enter into force at the planned time, that is from 1 January 2009.\nThe new programme for children using the Internet and other communication technologies, as we know, will be based on four main lines of action: reducing illegal or harmful content and combating harmful online behaviour; promoting a safer online environment, including through ad hoc technological instruments; information, participation and prevention to raise public awareness of the opportunities and risks associated with the use of online technologies; and, lastly, establishing a knowledge base to encourage cooperation and exchanges of good practice and information at international level.\nThe statistics speak for themselves, as Commissioner Reding is well aware: the age at which children access the Internet has dropped considerably. From as early as the age of 9 or 10, children are going online several times a week, and 75% of 12- to 15-year-olds in Europe use the Internet for roughly three hours a day, communicating through chat services, messaging and social networking sites.\nThe aim of the programme is not, of course, to criminalise the Internet in a catastrophic vision of new technologies; quite the contrary. Our objective is to provide suitable tools to better understand ", "Order of business\nPresident\nThe final draft of the agenda for this sitting, as agreed by the Conference of Presidents meeting on Thursday, 5 February 2009, in accordance with Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been circulated. The following amendments have been proposed:\nWednesday:\nThe Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has requested that Mr Reul's report on possible solutions to the challenges in relation to oil supply be deferred to the next part-session.\nHerbert Reul\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, we debated this motion long and hard in the committee, and we reached a decision backed by a large majority, but yesterday and today, there has been an abundance of advice and suggestions that have come about primarily because other committees have added extra subjects for discussion.\nIt seems to me that it would be a good idea not to make the decision today but, instead, to have the opportunity at a later date to find a solution which Parliament is then in a position to support. I therefore ask that you adopt this deferral today. Thank you.\nHannes Swoboda\nMr President, we have tabled two motions, neither of which, most probably, will achieve a broad majority in this House. I therefore wish to endorse this motion.\nMr President, with your permission, we will also move to defer Mr Berman's report. If this motion is not accepted due to the lateness of its timing, I would like to say, now, that we will move tomorrow to postpone the vote on the report. Thank you.\nPresident\nThank you very much, Mr Swoboda.\nDoes anyone wish to oppose the motion?\nClaude Turmes\nMr President, my group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, has tabled a resolution which has the support of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and large parts of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament. I therefore think that Mr Reul is calling for a deferral out of fear that his position is a minority one.\nI ", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of Tuesday, 14 July 1998 have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nJanssen van Raay\nMr President, I will not delay matters because I am concerned with the Minutes, the unconstitutional compulsion to vote, the unconstitutional imposition of financial obligations and the disastrous fiscal consequences; but you are a renowned lawyer and instead of having my say here I will this morning write you a letter and place it on your desk.\n\nPresident\nThank you very much for your cooperation, Mr Janssen van Raay.\n(The Minutes were approved)\n\nWelcome\nPresident\nOn behalf of the European Parliament, I want to welcome to today's sitting the members of the Hungarian Parliament Delegation to the EU-Hungary Joint Parliamentary Committee, led by Dr J\u00f2zsef Sz\u00e1jer, who have taken their seats in the official gallery.\n\nProgramme of the Austrian presidency\nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council on the programme of activities of the Austrian presidency.\nI am going to give the floor to Mr Sch\u00fcssel, who will speak on behalf of the Council. I want to extend a special welcome to him on the occasion of the opening speech of the first Austrian presidency. I am sure we all wish him the greatest success in the task of exercising, for the first time, the Presidency of the Council of the European Union.\nMr Sch\u00fcssel has the floor.\n\nSch\u00fcssel\nMr President, Mr President of the Commission, Members of the European Parliament, Austria is assuming the Presidency at an exciting and momentous time for Europe. The Union is in the process of implementing two projects that will have a decisive impact on the face of our continent in the 21st century.\nWith the advent of the euro, Europe is taking a great stride towards economic and political unity, and, as the largest integrated economic area in the world, it is simultaneously becoming one of the key players in the world economy. At the same time, the enlargement of the U", "Single Market Act (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the Single Market Act.\nMichel Barnier\nMadam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to officially present to the Members of this House the Communication on the Single Market Act, which was adopted by the Commission on 27 October, and to debate it here with you. We actually began our discussions yesterday at the instigation of Mr Harbour and Mr Grech, in another place but with several hundred political, economic and social stakeholders active at European, national and regional level.\nThis is an important document. It is important, ladies and gentlemen, because we believe that Europe is being called to account on many fronts. The outside world has questions about the reasons for the crises. We have experienced an incredibly harsh financial crisis over the past two years, and its many economic, social and human repercussions are still being felt in all our countries. There is the economic crisis, in general, and then there are other crises that we cannot afford to ignore, such as the food crisis, even though less is said about them. Approximately one billion people are in danger of dying from starvation or lack of water. Then there is the environmental crisis, which is probably the worst.\nWe need to respond to these questions, but in addition to these external questions, there are internal questions, the most important of which is undoubtedly that being asked by the European citizens, who do not understand, who are often concerned, and sometimes angry, who remain unconvinced and have questions about this large single market that is the cornerstone and has been since the inception of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1950 - this large European market that we are patiently building together.\nThe question being asked by our citizens, by small and medium-sized enterprises, is: what does this single market have to offer us? What is Europe doing for us? We need to give a positiv", "Waste electrical and electronic equipment (debate) \nPresident\n(The next item is the report by Mr Florenz, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) (recast) - C6-0472/2008 -.\nKarl-Heinz Florenz\nrapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Mr Poto\u010dnik, firstly I would like to thank all the kind people in this House and in the Commission who have helped me during this phase. The process has not been exactly straightforward. The cooperation with the Commission was excellent and I would like once again to give my sincere thanks to the team in my office who worked around the clock on this report.\nThe issue of electronic waste is not about implementing exaggerated environmental standards. On the one hand, it is true that these are environmental standards, but on the other hand, this also concerns the question of safeguarding our supplies of raw materials in Europe. We all know that in the foreseeable future raw materials will be in short supply. What use are advanced technologies if we no longer have any raw materials?\nTherefore, we also need to look at this report from an economic perspective and then it unfortunately becomes clear that we are weak in a number of areas. The European countries have varying collection rates. The countries in the north are the best, with a rate of 16 kg per head of population. The worst performer is the country where my name comes from, where only 1 kg per year is collected. With rates of 16 kg and 1 kg, it is important not to keep quiet about those countries with a good record, but we also need to name and shame the poor performers and I intend to do that.\nWe must finally introduce uniform criteria in this directive, because these have been lacking until now. Every country is doing what it wants and using its own definitions. This is why it is not really possible to bring the countries", "Conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator - International carriage of passengers by coach and bus (recast) - International carriage of goods by road (recast) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following reports:\nby Mrs \u0162ic\u0103u, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing common rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator - C6-0145/2007 -;\nby Mr Grosch, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for access to the market for coach and bus services (recast) - C6-0147/2007 -; and\nby Mr Grosch, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for access to the international road haulage market (recast) - C6-0146/2007 -.\nRadovan \u017derjav\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (SL) Mrs \u0162ic\u0103u, Mr Grosch, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission published draft legislative instruments in July 2007. These were the proposal for a regulation on common rules for admission to the occupation of road transport operator, the proposal for a regulation on common rules for access to the international road haulage market, and the proposal for a regulation on common rules for access to the market for transport services by coach and bus.\nThe Portuguese Presidency began work on the regulation on common rules for access to the international road haulage market, and the Slovenian Presidency continued this work and also opened the other two dossiers. In parallel with the work in the working group, we also began informal talks with rapporteurs in the European Parliament.\nAt the April meeting of the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy (TTE) Council, ministers conduc", "EC-Comoros fisheries agreement - Community financial measures for the implementation of the common fisheries policy and in the area of the Law of the Sea - Fisheries - transitional technical measures - Imports from Greenland of fishery products (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on:\nthe report by Mr Capoulas Santos on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries relating to the recommendation on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Partnership Agreement in the fisheries sector between the European Community and the Union of the Comoros.\n(15572/2010 - C7-0020/2011 - 2010/0287(NLE)) and\nthe report by Mr Ferreira on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 861/2006 of 22 May 2006 establishing Community financial measures for the implementation of the common fisheries policy and in the area of the Law of the Sea\n- C7-0107/2010 - and\nthe report (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=REPORT&reference=A7-2011-0024&language=DE\" \\t \"_blank\" ) by Mrs Grelier on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1288/2009 establishing transitional technical measures from 1 January 2010 to 30 June 2011\n- C7-0282/2010 - and\nthe report (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=REPORT&reference=A7-2011-0057&language=DE\" \\t \"_blank\" ) by Mrs Fraga Est\u00e9vez on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries on the proposal for a Council decision laying down rules for imports into the European Union from Greenland of fishery products, live bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates, marine gastropods and by-products thereof -.\nLuis Manuel Capoulas Santos\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the external strand of the common fis", "Closure of the sitting\nPresident\nAll that remains is for me to thank our members of the public, who are few in numbers but attentive, for their presence.

When I look at the clock over there, the impression is of Parliament\u2019s having ground to a halt and of its no longer moving. That is how it has been for quite a long time, and I think we should do something about it. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Mr\u00a0Rovsing, I have been informed that the wall clock that you mentioned is indeed broken, and perhaps has been for a few months. We do, though, have another clock that works but which is located behind you. You will therefore have to turn around to check the exact time.\nWe will, however, have the technicians carry out the necessary repairs and so prevent you from having to speak again on the same subject. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0053/2004) by Mr\u00a0Belder, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on EU-Russia relations. \nBelder (EDD ),\n\u00a0\u00a0 . \u2013 Mr President, the intent of this proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on EU-Russia relations is clear \u2013 a partnership that is truly worthy of the name. Accordingly, a strengthening of these mutual relations rather than growing mutual separation is what is required. Looked at in a matter-of-fact way, that is also what our many common interests require. In all fairness, however, relations between the EU and the Russian Federation are anything but ideal, and for this both parties are to blame. That is, therefore, the angle of this proposal for a recommendation: European self-criticism and criticism levelled at Moscow. In the autumn of last year, that is the very course on which this House\u2019s Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy embarked. To our satisfaction, we can conclude today that the Commission, according to its communication of 10 February, is mor", "1. Situation in Sri Lanka\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on four motions for resolutions on the situation in Sri Lanka.\nTobias Pfl\u00fcger\nMadam President, a humanitarian disaster is currently taking place in the north of Sri Lanka that is receiving relatively little attention. The Sri Lankan army is carrying out attacks on the civilian population that could even be described as massacres. A hospital has even come under fire and, according to humanitarian organisations, the overall situation is disastrous. The Red Cross has raised the alarm.\nThe situation in Sri Lanka has escalated, and the European Union is not blameless in this, having torpedoed the negotiations that were held under the leadership of Norway by placing the LTTE on the EU list of terrorist organisations. This meant that negotiations within the European Union were no longer possible.\nIn Sri Lanka itself, freedom of the press no longer exists. Recently, a journalist was killed. The German ambassador, who spoke at his funeral, was described by the President as someone who should leave the country. All he had done was to describe the situation accurately.\nThere is talk of thousands of refugees in the north, and I must make it quite clear that the whole situation there is one on which we should be focusing much more attention. The European Union should be coming out very much more clearly against what the Sri Lankan Government is currently doing. The attacks by both the Sri Lankan army and the LTTE are wrong; it is clear that it is mainly civilians who are being hit.\nWe need to help the people trapped in the north and to achieve an immediate cease-fire, as it is quite clear that very large numbers of civilians are being killed there. This is unacceptable, and the European Union shares the blame for this if it fails to state much more clearly that the support for the Sri Lankan Government must end.\nCharles Tannock\nauthor. - Madam President, Sri Lanka's bloody civil war seems finally to be coming to a c", "Assessment and management of flood risks (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the recommendation for second reading by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the Council common position with a view to adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the assessment and management of flood risks (12131/6/2006 C6-0038/2007 (Rapporteur: Richard Seeber).\nRichard Seeber \nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me take a moment to thank my friend Jacques Barrot for repeatedly confronting the problems involved in transalpine freight haulage and for being our comrade-in-arms on the long march towards the solution of these problems.\nToday, however, we are speaking about floods and what can be done about them at the European level. At this juncture I wish to thank Commissioner Dimas and his staff, the shadow rapporteurs and the German Presidency, all of whom have worked very constructively with me to achieve an agreement at second reading, a far-reaching agreement that covers all the key issues.\nI need hardly remind you that floods have become the commonest form of natural disaster in Europe. In 2002 and 2005 we had raging floods with devastating effects. They claimed people's lives and caused serious damage to housing and infrastructure. Those floods hit us hard. There is sound scientific evidence that heavy rainfall is becoming increasingly frequent and severe and that this trend is directly linked to human activity.\nThe first reason lies in concentrated urbanisation, especially in high-risk areas, with the development of built-up areas and streets, river realignments and ill-considered construction schemes on flood plains. The second reason is deforestation, especially the authorised clearing of river valleys for developments such as the construction of holiday chalets but also for industrial estates and shopping centres. Thirdly, highly intensive farming practices result in topsoil being seal", "Explanations of vote\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Goudin and Nils Lundgren \nin writing. (SV) We would again offer our fundamental perspective on the EU's budget.\nThe June List believes that the EU's budget should be limited to 1% of the Member States' average GNI. We have therefore chosen to vote against all the increases proposed by the European Parliament, at the same time as the June List has welcomed the few savings proposed in the form of amendments by either the Committee on Budgets or individual Members.\nThere are quite a few unfortunate budget headings, but the June List particularly regrets the large amount of aid for the EU's agricultural policy, Cohesion Fund and fishing industry, as well as the budget headings under which various forms of information campaign are to be subsidised.\nThe June List also believes that Parliament's constant commuting between Strasbourg and Brussels must cease and that the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions should be closed down.\nOn 23 October 2006, the EU's Court of Auditors observed for the thirteenth year in a row that it could not guarantee that more than a small part of the EU's budget had been used correctly or for the purposes intended. How can this madness continue whereby, year after year, financial resources are appropriated, only a small portion of which can be guaranteed to be used for the purposes for which they were intended?\nJens Holm, Kartika Tamara Liotard, Erik Meijer and Eva-Britt Svensson \nin writing. We cannot support this budget for a number of reasons. First of all, out of protest against the fact that a few months ago the Court of Auditors once again did not approve the EU's accounts. Because the EU cannot successfully combat fraud and inefficiency, it should not increase its budget. Secondly, we believe this budget makes the wrong political choices, such as too large a focus on industrial agriculture and foreign policy and military projects, and not enough on environment and social projec", "14. Lamfalussy follow up - Future Structure of Supervision (\n- Before the vote on paragraph 2(c) of the Annex:\nIeke van den Burg\nco-rapporteur. - Mr President, in the light of topical developments we have strengthened the text in an oral amendment about the deposit guarantee schemes, and it reads 'the Lamfalussy Level 3 Committees can take decisions on the basis of a fair ...'. Sorry, I have the wrong one.\nThis one is about qualified majority voting in the Level 3 Committees. This text is brought in line with what should be done to guarantee that host Member States have an important say in the group supervision, and it reads that 'the Lamfalussy Level 3 committees take decisions on the basis of a fair and appropriate QMV system that takes into account the relative size of the financial sector and the GDP of each member State, as well as the systemic importance of the financial sector for the Member State'. From then on it is the same text.\nPresident\nMrs van den Burg, unless I am mistaken I do not think that you read out the correct text.\nIeke van den Burg\nco-rapporteur. - Mr President, it is the second one. It was indeed about the deposit guarantee schemes. We tried to strengthen the present text by asking that these rules in the European Union be 'urgently revised to avoid arbitrage between guarantee levels in Member States that may further increase volatility and undermine financial stability instead of increasing security and depositors' confidence'. Then it says they should also guarantee a level playing field for financial institutions. Sorry for this.\n(Parliament agreed to accept both oral amendments)\n- Before the vote on Amendment 8:\nDaniel D\u0103ianu\nco-rapporteur. - Mr President, also as an acknowledgement of the frantic search by EU Member States to rescue the banking system, but not in a sufficiently coordinated way, we have thought that it makes sense to introduce this amendment. It reads: 'whereas the increasing cross-border nature of banking in Europe and ", "14. Textile imports (vote) \n- Motion for a resolution\nPresident\nBefore we proceed to the vote on the last report, allow me to dedicate this last vote to a fellow Member who will be leaving us in a few days' time and who has done a wonderful job for us here, at the European Parliament, and for the whole of Europe. It is, of course, Jean-Louis Bourlanges.\n(Applause)\nMr Bourlanges, I hope that the warmth of this applause tells you, more than any speech, how much we will miss you. We wish you all the best.\n", "10. Research, technological development and demonstration activities (2007-2013, FP7) (vote) \n- Before the vote:\nGiles Chichester \ndraftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - I just wish to inform the House that the compromise package of amendments, which is in the first block, and amendment 15 represent a hard-negotiated compromise with the Council and the Commission. I would urge colleagues to vote for the package and against any other amendment, irrespective of its content or merits, because we have an agreement that will enable the Framework Programme to go forward and be implemented in January. Adopting any other amendment might put that at risk by reopening the procedure, which would be a matter of great concern to the research community.\n(Applause)\nCarlo Casini\n(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have tabled two amendments: numbers 47 and 48. However, with regard to the second one, number 48, the common position has been corrected in line with the aim of this amendment. I am therefore satisfied, since there is no sense in voting on an amendment that has already been accepted.\nThe second part of the other amendment has been declared inadmissible, that is to say the part that specifies today's date, 30 November, as the deadline for destroying embryos used for the procurement of stem cells. I do not agree with the declaration of inadmissibility, against which I can unfortunately do nothing. What remains of the article is the replacement of the word 'extraction', as it features in the common position, with the word 'use', as Parliament was proposing back at the stage of first reading.\nThis is an issue of secondary importance, although, with the Commissioner having stated last night that, throughout the entire development phase of the programme, the Commission would accept the word 'use' and not the word 'extraction' - which, in practice, means that it will not fund any research into the destruction of embryos - I feel that", "22. EU-Russia summit (vote) \n- Joint motion for a resolution: EU-Russia summit\n- Before the vote:\nKonrad Szyma\u0144ski\n(PL) Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that, following the discussion on the compromise version of this resolution, we had precisely 16 minutes to submit amendments and to review the results of our work. I believe that this undermines the rights of every Member of this House and every political group in this House to be able freely to influence the texts of our resolutions, including by submitting amendments.\nI would ask that this situation should not be allowed to reoccur in the future.\n- Before the vote on amendment 1:\nRia Oomen-Ruijten\non behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I would like to propose the following amendment to Paragraph 6. This will require a split vote. The first sentence should be changed to read:\n'emphasises that the situation in Chechnya continues to be a point of dissent in the relations between the EU and Russia'\n(NL) replacing the text as it currently stands. The rapporteur is in agreement.\n( The oral amendment was accepted)\n- Before the vote on paragraph 23\nRia Oomen-Ruijten\non behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, we must allow the realities to speak for themselves, and the summit on Siberian overflights. This has not taken place, so we ask that the reference to it in the text be replaced by a reference to the next summit.\n(The oral amendment was accepted.)\n- Before the vote on recital O:\nHannes Swoboda\non behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, we speak about frozen conflicts. We mention two conflicts - Abkhazia and South Ossetia - but I would like, on behalf of my Group, to introduce after 'frozen conflict' the phrase 'such as Transnistria', so that Transnistria is also mentioned in Recital O.\nMarianne Mikko\non behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, Mr Swoboda has already informed you of our amendment, which was about Transnistria.\n(The oral amendment was accepted.)\n", "8. EU strategy for reform in the Arab world (vote) \n- Report: Rocard\n- Before the vote on Amendment 19:\nMarco Cappato\n(IT) Mr President, I propose that the phrase 'full respect, including legal respect, for different sexual orientations', should be amended as follows: 'full respect for, and non-discrimination against, different sexual orientations'.\n(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)\n- Before the vote on Amendment 14:\nMarco Cappato\n(IT) Mr President, I propose to replace the term 'Palestinian State' with 'democratic Palestinian State'.\n(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)\nV\u00e9ronique De Keyser\n(FR) Mr President, my group does not object to the oral amendment, but we are not in favour of Amendment 14, even when amended by the oral amendment.\n- Before the vote on Amendment 20:\nMarco Cappato\n(FR) This is simply a linguistic point, given that it is the French version that is deemed authentic. Thus the words 'secular Islamicists' would not replace the words 'moderate Islamicists' but would be regarded as an addition.\n- Before the vote on Amendment 21:\nV\u00e9ronique De Keyser\n(FR) Mr President, Mr Cappato has tabled an oral amendment, by means of which he is asking for the separation of Church and State more or less to be guaranteed. We would ask to add as an oral amendment:\n'as it should be in any democracy'.\n(FR) Indeed, while Islam mixes politics and religion, in Europe, among our countries, there are also those who do not separate Church and State.\n(Applause from the left)\nAntonio Tajani\n(IT) Mr President, Mr Cappato's amendment deals with the separation of political and religious power. We are talking about countries of the Arab world here, not about countries of Europe. If the amendment relates to the countries of the Arab world, we are in agreement, because, when we speak of the church, we refer solely to the Catholic or the Protestant church.\nThis amendment relates to religious power and political power, and it should be made clear that we are referring only t", "3. The case of the al-Kurd family\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolution on the case of the al-Kurd family.\nMarios Matsakis\nauthor. - Mr President, let me commence by stating that I am speaking in a personal capacity on this topic.\nLet me also say that I am well aware, as you all should be, that whatever is said in this Chamber regarding Israel gets scrutinised very meticulously by the Israeli authorities and then gets totally disregarded as far as the substance of the matter is concerned. The only action taken is to attack, in various ways, those MEPs who criticised in any way, shape or form Israeli wrongdoings.\nI have had personal experience of this. During the recent debates in this House on Palestinian prisoners in Israel, I used strong language to attack the Israeli Government officials. I did this in order to stress to them that their stance on the Palestinian prisoners was - and still is, I am afraid - utterly inhuman and criminal.\nSubsequent to my speech, not only did the Ambassador of Israel to Cyprus embark on a political defamation campaign against me, but, more importantly, the Speaker of the Knesset, Ms Dalia Itzik, wrote an official letter of complaint against me personally to the President of the European Parliament. Mr P\u00f6ttering replied as diplomatically as he could, and I thank him for defending the right of free speech of MEPs in debates taking place in this House. I also thank him for copying his reply to Ms Itzik to me. I have that letter here and I submit it to the Secretariat so that there is evidence that what I am saying is true.\nFurthermore, I have this message for Ms Itzik: in the European Parliament, and in the EU in general, we have the right to express our opinions freely and democratically. Perhaps you, Ms Itzik, should do the same in your parliament and in your country too.\nAs regards the subject matter of this resolution, I wish to say the following. First, this is not a judicial civil matter, as some ill-", "Agenda: see Minutes\nPresident\nI must also inform you that, with regard to Mr Leinen's report on the amendment of Rules 15 and 182(1) of the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure: Election of Quaestors and the Bureau of committees, the vote on which was scheduled for tomorrow, Thursday, in the end the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has not approved it pursuant to Rule 131, and we will therefore hold a debate on it as the final item of tonight's sitting.\nRenato Brunetta\n(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I understand the need for security, but I must complain about the discourteous attitude and, frankly, even violent behaviour with which some security agents stopped us Members and barred our way outside this Chamber.\nThat is utterly unacceptable. I understand the reasons for security, but I do think that there needs to be courtesy and respect for our roles on both sides.\nPresident\nThe Secretary-General informs me that we have problems with certain auxiliaries who are involved in an emerging dispute. The security officers are trying to ensure that everything takes place in its normal fashion, but we are facing difficulties as a result of the attitude of certain contracted workers who are affected by industrial arrangements.\nTadeusz Zwiefka\n(PL) Mr President, yesterday was a great occasion for the European Parliament. It was a very important day for us, as the Sakharov Prize was awarded to Mr Alexander Milinkevich.\nI would like to tell you that when Mr Alexander Milinkevich began his speech here at the European Parliament, the internal broadcasting system in the European Parliament buildings failed, as did the Internet transmission system. In Belarus the Internet was the only way to hear the speech. This meant there was no access to the speech and, as a result, the citizens of Belarus received no news of what happened here last night.\nI would like to ask the President to investigate the reasons for this incident and to inform the House of his findings.\n(Ap", "The Intelligent Transport Systems Action Plan - Intelligent Transport Systems in the field of road transport and interfaces with other transport modes (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on\nthe report by Anne E. Jensen, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the Intelligent Transport Systems Action Plan, and\nthe report by Anne E. Jensen, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the framework for the deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in the field of road transport and for interfaces with other transport modes - C6-0512/2008 -.\nAnne E. Jensen\nrapporteur. - (DA) Madam President, I am not sure whether I can speak with the same enthusiasm as Mr Savary, but intelligent transport systems are a very exciting topic. So, what are intelligent transport systems? Well, it is not that simple to answer that question, because we are talking about a whole host of different systems: systems which enable safer, more effective and environmentally sound transport, by taking advantage of modern information and communication technology. ITS, as intelligent transport is also known, is therefore a generic term covering many different things. Under the umbrella of ITS can be found things as diverse as eCall, which generates an automatic call to an emergency call centre in the case of an accident, road toll systems, which are systems designed to collect road charges, and the already widely known GPS systems, which many of us have in our cars to help us navigate through unknown terrain.\nHowever, ITS has many other untapped potentials: potentials for communication between vehicles, between vehicle and road and between vehicle and information centre. So, why are we not simply starting to use this technology on a larger scale, if it is so good? Well, what we face here is the question of which comes first, the chicken or the egg. Should the technology i", "8. Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EC and Serbia (\nBefore the vote on Amendment 4:\nUlrike Lunacek\nMadam President, I would like to table an oral amendment to this Amendment No 4 by Ms Brantner and me, deleting the latter part. It should read: 'Calls on Serbia to enter into dialogue with Kosovo without any longer referring to new negotiations on its status'.\nI hope I have your support for that.\nBernd Posselt\n(DE) Madam President, I would just like to recommend under these circumstances that we vote in favour of this.\nJelko Kacin\nMadam President, in view of the importance of human rights, I would like to have a roll-call vote on Amendment 8. It addresses the surprising and unfortunate decision by the Serbian Government not to attend the Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony in Oslo. At the same time, the amendment praises the Serbian Ombudsman's decision to attend the ceremony on behalf of the Serbian people. It is a message to Serbia and all future candidate states that bargaining with human rights is not acceptable.\nIn order to have broader support for this amendment, I also want to submit a very short oral - basically compromise - amendment, originally prepared by Mrs Maria Eleni Koppa. I want to add the word 'initial' between 'the government's' and 'decision', so the wording will be 'Regrets the government's initial decision not to attend the Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony in Oslo on 10 December; welcomes, on the other hand, the Ombudsman's initiative to attend the ceremony as a responsible and praiseworthy decision'.\nI urge all my colleagues to support this amendment.\n", "Meat imports from third countries (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on meat imports from third countries.\nAndroulla Vassiliou\nMadam President, I apologise because this issue is of great interest and has many facets and I shall be a little long-winded in my statement for the benefit of the honourable Members of Parliament.\nThe Commission has in place a robust set of EU animal and public health requirements for meat coming from third countries.\nFor a number of years, the EU has maintained a very effective import policy which takes into account scientific developments and the current disease situation in third countries. In particular, it pays close attention to foot-and-mouth disease in exporting third countries because, as you know, the EU is free of this disease, which has the potential to cause serious economic harm. Very detailed standards and requirements have been established at the level of the World Organisation for Animal Health to prevent the spread of FMD.\nThe WTO agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary measures acknowledges that, while countries may use different standards and different methods of inspecting products, this does not necessarily increase the animal and public health risks. The EU cannot impose an exact replica of our internal legislative measures on third countries, just as third countries, to which we export, cannot impose their own national rules on us. We can only require that their measures have an equivalent effect to ours.\nLet me take traceability as an example. In the EU, we have very stringent rules on the individual identification and traceability of cattle. In case of a disease outbreak, our rules facilitate the tracing of potentially infected animals to limit the spread of the disease. In addition, our rules allow us to trace and follow food or feed through all stages of production and distribution from farm to table. On the other hand, traceability rules applying to third countries exporting to the EU ", "Explanations of vote\nPresident\n\u03a4he next item is the oral explanations of vote.\nZolt\u00e1n Balcz\u00f3\nMr President, can I ask you for a two-minute break while people are leaving the Chamber? Or a one-minute break?\nZolt\u00e1n Balcz\u00f3\n(HU) The aim of the regulation is a positive one: to collect information from Member States relating to energy infrastructure, organise it and make it accessible at Community level to economic actors. It thus - rightly - intervenes in the functioning of the market. Parliament has, however, accepted an initiative that is diametrically opposed to this, and even goes so far as to regard that as being the political aim of the regulation. I quote: Any measures proposed or taken at Union level should be neutral and should not amount to interventions in the functioning of the market. The majority of those sitting in this Parliament have learnt nothing from the global financial and economic crisis. It continues to stand up for neoliberal dogmas and even in this strategic area, it trusts in the self-regulation of the market. This is unacceptable, and hence I have voted against the resolution.\nPeter Jahr\n(DE) Mr President, a functioning infrastructure in the European Union is a decisive factor in the reasonable growth of prosperity. Alongside food security and a common foreign and security policy, energy policy plays a crucial role. For this reason alone, it is essential for the European Parliament not only to take part in this discussion, but also to have the right of codecision. Therefore, I call on the Commission to bring an end to its blockade policy and to grant Parliament the right of codecision.\nRyszard Czarnecki\n(PL) Mr President, I will speak very briefly. The whole idea is quite right. I particularly like the emphasis on the ecological aspect. Since we are talking about this, let us be consistent. It was precisely matters relating to ecology and environment protection which were the significant, factual arguments on which opposition to the idea of the", "Announcement of the candidates for election to the office of President\nPresident\nI would remind you that the election of the President will begin at 10 a.m. and I would point out that, in accordance with the provisions of Rule 11(2) of the Rules of Procedure, no business shall be transacted while the oldest Member is in the Chair unless it is concerned with the election of the President or the verification of credentials.\nI would also remind you that, in accordance with the provisions of Rule 12(1) of the Rules of Procedure, nominations for the presidency of the European Parliament must be submitted with the consent of the nominees and that they may only be made by a political group or by at least 40 Members.\nUnder the conditions laid down by the Rules of Procedure, I have received the following nominations for the presidency of the European Parliament:\nMr Jens-Peter Bonde\nMrs Monica Frassoni\nMr Hans-Gert Poettering\nMr Francis Wurtz\nThe candidates have stated that they accept their respective nominations.

Defence of the parliamentary immunity of Mr Bruno Gollnisch (\nBruno Gollnisch\n(FR) Madam President, I shall speak for just two minutes, if I may, since there is no debate or oral explanation of vote, which I find rather astonishing in this kind of procedure.

We have already had serious problems of this kind to contend with, as has the previous Commission, but in this particular case the accusation has been levelled that DM 300 000 were allegedly paid to an agency with nothing being received in return. I call upon you to inform the Council of this and to urge it to relieve Mr Hombach of all his duties until such time as this investigation has been resolved in a conclusive and legally valid manner. We cannot afford for the European Union to make a bad impression again.\n\nPresident\nWe take note of your comments, Mr Zimmerling.\n\nMcKenna\nYesterday evening after the votes in the Chamber, a comment was made which I would like to distance myself from and not to be associated with. There was no mistake in the interpretation and Members of this House did refer to the Technical Group as the Technical Group of Racists. This was an unfair comment. No one could, by the wildest stretch of the imagination, consider someone like Emma Bonino a racist.\nPeople need to be extremely careful how they treat other people in this Chamber. Some people may not like the fact that the Technical Group has been set up, but it has been. These Members were elected just like me and every other Member in this House and we have to accept that fact. People have rights and I do not think that the comment that was made yesterday was acceptable.\n\nPresident\nWe take note of your comments, Mrs McKenna.\n\nSepp\u00e4nen\nMr President, when, in the sitting on Monday, I thanked the French State, the city of Strasbourg and the European Parliament for the fact that we could only get sound on the Finnish television channel and that t", "Economic governance in the EU and the eurozone, and surveillance of national budgets (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by the President of the Commission on economic governance in the EU and the eurozone, and surveillance of national budgets.\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, economic governance constitutes a crucial challenge for the future of our Union. When, in 1993, President Delors made clear the need for a deeper coordination of economic policies, many Member States rejected this.\nFurthermore, when the first Commission - which I had the honour of presiding over - brought up this question in its report on the tenth anniversary of economic and monetary union, in 2008, not many people listened. I nevertheless emphasised the need to provide an adequate response to the question of economic governance in my guidelines for the present term, which we discussed together about a year ago.\nCommissioner Olli Rehn then discussed this with you during his hearing. By that time, the Commission had already announced its intention to put forward proposals to strengthen economic governance in the European Union, particularly in the euro area. Unfortunately, the crisis has shown that we were right. However, the urgency of this debate is now recognised, and I can only welcome the fact that the conditions have finally come together for advancing towards a true European economic governance.\nAs a result, the Commission provided detailed proposals on 12 May. These proposals have kept the debate alive, including with the European Parliament, and particularly the work of the task force presided over by the President of the European Council. The Commission is pleased with the progress of this work and with the consensus achieved up to now, which was shown very clearly during the European Council.\nIn order to maintain this dynamic, last Wednesday, the Commission again adopted a range of proposals which, once converted into legislative initiatives, wi", "Question Time (Council) \nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B7-0552/2010).\nThe following questions are addressed to the Council.\n\nSubject: UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities\nThe Belgian Presidency has highlighted its firm intention to make progress in the fight against discrimination and to promote equality. In this context, what concrete measures, if any, is the Presidency taking to move forward the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by all 27 EU Member States?\nOlivier Chastel\nOn 7 June 2010, the Council adopted the resolution of the Council of the European Union and the representatives of the governments of the Member States, meeting within the Council, on a new European Disability Framework. This resolution invites Member States and the Commission, in accordance with their respective competences, to promote the ratification and application of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities concluded by the European Union on 26 November 2009. To date, the convention has been ratified by 13 Member States of the European Union.\nWithin the Council, we are therefore clearly expecting those Member States that have not yet done so to ratify this convention. In particular, Articles 3 and 4 of Council Decision 2010/48/EC stipulate that a code of conduct between Member States and the Commission must be adopted before the deposition of the instrument of formal confirmation on behalf of the European Union can take place, in order to lay down details of the point of contact function conferred upon the Commission. The work relating to the code of conduct is now in its final phase and should be finished by the end of the year.\nMarian Harkin\nI would like to thank the Council for its response. I am particularly pleased to hear you say that it could be concluded before the end of this year. I think you said 13 - my figure is that 16 Member States have ratified.\nCan the Council tell me what will be ", "\n\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, good morning. Yesterday an event occurred which caused something of a sensation. At around 3.00 p.m., Mr Batten made a statement about an incident in which members of our security staff were alleged to have been involved, and this provoked discussion which became very heated. The President has, within the 24 hours stipulated by Rule 166, come to a decision, which I will now communicate to you.\nThe Quaestors have already been informed of yesterday\u2019s incident, and it will be investigated by them. They will be interviewing all the persons involved in it, and will then submit a report on it to the President.\nI therefore take it as read that this incident can, for today, be regarded as closed, since there will be an investigation. We can therefore proceed with the agenda as normal. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is the Commission statement on the results of the Ukraine elections. \nPoto\u010dnik,\n\u00a0\u00a0 . Mr President, it is an honour and pleasure for me to present the Commission's view on the presidential elections in Ukraine. More than seven weeks have now passed since what is commonly described as Ukraine's Orange Revolution. The events during that period have shown that the people of Ukraine are committed to democracy and also that the EU Member States, by acting together, can play an important role.\nLet me turn now to three questions. First, how far has Ukraine come since the first running of the second round of the elections on 21 November 2004, and what does this mean for the country in the future? Second, what role has the EU played to assist Ukraine to find a peaceful solution to the crisis? Third, what are the challenges now in European Union-Ukraine relations?\nI shall begin with the developments in Ukraine and what they mean for the future. Most importantly, Ukraine has succeeded in finding a peaceful solution to the crisis it faced after the serious shortcomings in the conduct of the presidential elections and, notably,", "11. Financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland (2007-2010) (vote) \n- Before the vote:\nJim Higgins \nrapporteur. - Mr President, I wish to thank the members of the Committee on Regional Development for the support they have given to this report. I also wish to thank the Secretariat for its input.\nNothing I can say can adequately express the gratitude that the Irish people on both sides of the border feel for the investment that Europe has made for the economic regeneration of Northern Ireland, the border counties in the Irish Republic and the Northern Ireland Peace Process.\nTo date the International Fund for Ireland has contributed EUR 803 million of funding and has leveraged a further EUR 1.46 billion in supporting 5700 projects and the creation of 55 000 direct and indirect jobs. It is has also played a crucial role in easing sectarian tensions and bridging the divisions between the two traditions on the island. The guns are now hopefully permanently silent and the economies of Northern Ireland and the border counties of the south are beginning to realise their true economic potential.\nThis will be the last time that we will ask the EU for funding for this programme, as the International Fund will cease in 2010. We have had many false dawns in the past regarding the permanent political solution in Northern Ireland. However, my Irish colleagues and I are confident that we are, at long last, on the brink of a lasting solution and that a devolved government will soon become a reality for the long term.\n(The President cut off the speaker)\n", "Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network (recast) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Simpson, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network (recast) - C7-0111/2009 -.\nAs Mr Simpson cannot be here, Mr El Khadraoui will speak on his behalf.\nSa\u00efd El Khadraoui\ndeputising for the rapporteur. - Madam President, the Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Mr Simpson, is not able to join us today and has asked me to read out his statement.\nThe recast on the development of the guidelines of the TEN-T network seeks to bring together the various amendments adopted over the years to the guidelines and to incorporate amendments that take account of the enlargement of the EU to 27 Member States.\nTo give a bit of background to the report, the guidelines give direction to the development of the Trans-European transport network. The objective is to establish the network gradually by 2020 by integrating land, sea and air transport infrastructure networks throughout the Union.\nTurning back to the report at hand, it is, strictly speaking, a codification of the legislative text, but, because the Commission made some minor changes to the annex, they were forced to do it via the recast procedure. The changes to the annex are to correct initial mistakes that were made during the accession of the 10 new Member States that joined in 2004. The changes are not about updating the maps or making any substantive changes.\nThe two changes the rapporteur has introduced to the report involve minor modifications in the recitals and some technical corrections to the maps. These are in line with the changes made by the Council and in line with correcting the guidelines.\nFollowing the Commission's advice, the decision was taken, both by Council and by Mr Simpson as rapport", "Vaccination against bluetongue (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Janusz Wojciechowski, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2000/75/EC as regards vaccination against bluetongue - 05499/2011 - C7-0032/2011 -.\nJanusz Wojciechowski\nrapporteur. - (PL) Mr President, it is with great satisfaction that I can present my report to Parliament on amendments to the directive as regards vaccination against bluetongue, a disease which poses a huge risk to cattle, sheep and goat breeding in many EU Member States. I am particularly happy since, three years ago in this Chamber, during a previous term of office, I had the privilege of presenting a report on a new strategy for animal health based on the principle 'better prevention than cure'. Today's amendment to the directive as regards vaccination against bluetongue is a practical realisation of this very principle. We are improving protection against this disease, and we are contributing to better animal health. Costs relating to their treatment will be lower and the whole vaccination process will be better organised.\nThe amendment relates to the fact that the current directive from the year 2000 was adapted to conditions at the time and, in particular, to the vaccinations which were then available on the market. Those vaccinations had to be and still have to be administered, but with certain restrictions due to the fact that there is a danger of the virus being transferred from vaccinated animals to those which have not been vaccinated. This means that various restrictions are required during the vaccination process, for example, vaccinations being administered in specified areas and restrictions being applied to the movements of animals. This represents quite a burden for breeders and, as a result, the efficacy of these vaccinations is limited. Science has taken a step forward. We have sec", "11. Specific tasks for the European Central Bank concerning the functioning of the European Systemic Risk Board (\nBefore the final vote:\nRamon Tremosa i Balcells\nrapporteur. - Madam President, I also suggest postponing the vote on the draft legislative resolution. Yesterday afternoon, in the debate on the legislative package, no member of the Council was present in this Parliament.\n", "Railway safety, including the European signalling system (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on railway safety, including the European signalling system.\nSiim Kallas\nVice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the train accident in Buizingen on Monday, 15 February 2010 was a shocking tragedy. I understand that in the aftermath of this serious accident, several technical and political questions concerning rail safety can be asked.\nFirst of all, my thoughts are with the victims of this tragedy and their relatives. It is always difficult to find words of consolation for these sad occasions and silence is sometimes more telling. The causes of the accident are not yet fully known and the technical investigation has been launched in accordance with the provisions of the EU Safety Directive.\nIt is the responsibility of the Belgian investigation body to carry this out. It should be accomplished independently of any judicial inquiry. The objective of the technical investigation is not to apportion blame and liability, but rather to identify causes with a view to improving railway safety and the prevention of accidents.\nThe Belgian investigation body has asked the European Railway Agency to support it in its investigation. Two investigators from the agency joined the Belgian team in charge of the investigation just a few hours after the accident occurred.\nI would like to stress that, since the causes of the accident have not yet been clarified, it is inappropriate to draw conclusions. Of course, I am prepared to clarify some issues, which were raised in the aftermath of this tragedy, and I will share with you my understanding of the situation.\nAs is too often the case when rail accidents happen, remarks alleging a link between European rules or regulations and the accident are made. I would first like to be very clear on the opening-up of the market. Alongside the opening-up of the rail freight sector to competition and the establishment of req", "Prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances - Implementation of excessive deficit procedure - Requirements for budgetary frameworks of Member States - Budgetary surveillance in euro area - Surveillance of budgetary positions and surveillance and coordination of economic policies - Enforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in euro area (continuation of debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances; excessive deficit procedure; requirements for budgetary frameworks of Member States; budgetary surveillance in the euro area; surveillance of budgetary positions and surveillance and coordination of economic policies; and enforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area.\nAntol\u00edn S\u00e1nchez Presedo\n(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our citizens want a strong and effective European Union. Sluggishness, inadequacy and a purely intergovernmental vision are worsening the impact of the crisis and weakening the credibility of the European project.\nWe are not facing problems that are purely national, or a crisis that is only economic; we are facing a political crisis that requires a swift, full, Europeanist response.\nThe basic concepts of 'economy' and 'union' in the Economic and Monetary Union must be strengthened. The proposal presented today on economic governance must be considerably improved if we are going to achieve that.\nWe are in favour of creating national budgetary frameworks that guarantee transparency, economic coordination and verification of compliance with European commitments.\nWe believe it is necessary to correct macroeconomic imbalances and move toward convergence, and we find that the Ferreira report makes particular progress in that area.\nHowever, the proposals to reform the Stability and Growth Pact are incomplete: they confuse stability with adjustment, and they entrust growth policies to the market and the nationa", "Consumer credit (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the recommendation for second reading of the report by Kurt Lechner, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the common position of the Council with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on consumer credit and repealing Directive 87/102/EEC (09948/2/2007 - C6-0315/2007 - 2002/0222 (COD)).\nKurt Lechner\nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner Kuneva, ladies and gentlemen, obtaining credit is a different matter from purchasing goods. The legal complexity of the transaction is far greater, and established national financing practices and legal traditions play a far greater part. Accordingly, public trust is often crucial in matters relating to consumer credit. Against this backdrop, harmonisation of the law on consumer credit has its limits and should be done cautiously and gradually.\nAs the weaker party to the contract, the consumer must undoubtedly receive legal protection, but at the same time the guiding principles in this field, as in the law of obligations in general, must be freedom of contract and the personal responsibility of grown-up people, not prescription and paternalism. National legislators must have enough discretion to guarantee consumer protection flexibly in their own countries and to deal quickly with awkward new developments in the sphere of consumer protection. A body of legal provisions alone does not ensure that consumers are actually protected. Impact assessments would have been essential, given that consumer credit affects hundreds of millions of people. Legislation should be based on typical case scenarios and not on exceptions.\nIn this respect, I must first of all thank the European Parliament as a whole for rejecting the Commission's totally unacceptable initial proposal and for amending it substantially and decisively at first reading. Secondly, I welcome wholeheartedly the new approach adopted by t", "7. Meat and livestock statistics (\n- Before the vote:\nFriedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf\nrapporteur. - (DE)\nMr President, it has in fact been fun. In terms of content, it is an important report, but I did not want to comment on it now.\nWe have not had any discussion, so it was agreed that I should comment briefly. This report concerns the codecision-making procedure. We had disputes with the Council on comitology procedure. In the codecision procedure we quite naturally wanted - as you negotiated - controls in the regulatory procedure we wanted Parliament to be able to intervene in the event of a change to the administrative procedures. The Council wanted to refuse us this. We have had a few altercations with the Council but have held sway in the end. If the Treaty, which was once called the Constitution, enters into force, there will have to be a further revision of the comitology procedure. We shall then have to ensure that what the Council has already been practising does not happen again and that we basically do not lose influence here.\nI say this so that the groups will also occupy themselves with this matter.\n", "Consular protection of citizens of the European Union in third countries (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on consular protection of citizens of the European Union in third countries.\nAlexandr Vondra\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, this debate on consular protection is, once again, a timely one. A series of events over the last few years have highlighted the importance of consular cooperation among the EU Member States. From Lebanon in 2006, through Chad to the recent tragic events in Mumbai - all have demonstrated the growing risks to citizens of the Union when travelling abroad. The extent of these risks is even greater as increasing numbers of people take advantage of low-cost travel to visit more remote regions of the world.\nCooperation between Member States in this area is therefore important. It offers a better service and an enhanced level of consular assistance. This is of direct benefit to EU citizens.\nThe Treaties provide us with a basis for this cooperation. Article 20 states clearly, and I quote: 'Every citizen of the Union shall, in the territory of a third country in which the Member State of which he is a national is not represented, be entitled to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of any Member State, on the same conditions as the nationals of that state. Member States shall establish the necessary rules among themselves and start the international negotiations required to secure this protection.'\nThe rules mentioned in this article are set out in a decision which was adopted in 1995. This decision specifies that assistance within a third country may be requested from a Member State other than one's own, on condition that there is no accessible permanent representation or accessible Honorary Consul competent for such matters.\nIn practice that means that a consul who is asked by a citizen of another Member State for assistance should refuse such assistance if that citizen'", "Approval of the minutes\n(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved.)\n\nNigel Farage\nMr President, the minutes of the last part-session mention your speech in which you talked about incidents that took place in Strasbourg in December. Since that time, under Rule 147 of our revered Rules of Procedure, you have called before you 13 Members of this Parliament to face disciplinary action.\nIt seems to me that this has been done on a pretty arbitrary basis. I doubt whether one of those that you have called - Ms Sinnott from our group - has ever shouted at anybody in her life. Another of the Members that you called to appear in the headmaster's study - an Austrian Member - was actually in Frankfurt on the day, so he must have one hell of a voice, must he not?\nWhy only 13? There were about 80 of us involved in these so-called disturbances. In fact, at the Conference of Presidents' meeting, you yourself named me as being one of the causes of the trouble, so why am I not being punished? I am Spartacus!\n(Cries of 'I am Spartacus!' from members of the IND/DEM Group)\nPresident\nI had asked for comments concerning the Minutes. I would have expected the chair of the IND/DEM Group to understand what the President was saying and to focus his remarks on the Minutes.

Situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina\nAfter the vote on Amendment 3\nDoris Pack\n(DE) Madam President, I would like to ask whether you realise that, in Article 6, the word 'central' before the word state needs to be deleted to make the wording consistent with the other texts.\nPresident\nYes, yes, we are definitely going to check all of the language versions, Mrs Pack.\n", "EU-United States summit\nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on the next EU-United States summit.\nDimitrij Rupel\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, let me say something about the coming EU-US summit. I shall use my own language, if you will permit me.\n(SL) Although the relationship between the European Union and the United States of America is essentially bilateral, the results of this relationship have global effects. The transatlantic partnership ceased to be merely economic long ago. The European Union and the United States cooperate closely both bilaterally and within international organisations on settling unresolved issues, including the most pressing regional issues, such as Afghanistan, the Middle East, and the Western Balkans.\nAs in all relationships, the European Union and the United States do, of course, sometimes have differences of opinion on certain issues, but we resolve them successfully with a constructive approach and mutual understanding. The European Union and the United States are an important, the most important, system which has a considerable effect on international relations. We have our differences but for the most part we work together as allies and friends. We have many common values and a historical link, throughout the twentieth century in fact, and in the end we stood together, side by side, during the end of the Cold War and the expansion of Euro-Atlantic links.\nSince the European Union finds it more difficult to reach consensus than the US, relations are, naturally, not straightforward. However, consensus cannot always be reached within the United States either. If we look at the reports from the election campaign we can see that consensus is difficult to reach even within the same party. The European Union is united in diversity and, I should say, proud of it. That is also the starting point of the Lisbon Treaty which, I hope, will enter into force at the beginning of next year.\nDuring ou", "Future of the European Common Asylum System (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the report by Giusto Catania, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Future of the European Common Asylum System.\nGiusto Catania\nrapporteur. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the last year the number of refugees worldwide has increased. The figure now stands at approximately 12 million. If we include those who are internally displaced, this rises to more than 26 million people worldwide who are in need of the same kind of protection. The reason for this is that wars continue to exist in the world; at present there are 4 million Iraqi refugees and displaced people, and it is clear that these refugees are a consequence of wars that our countries played a part in starting.\nThe creation of a common European asylum policy is necessary because, under the rule of law, we have an obligation to guarantee that these people are received equally throughout the European Union. This becomes all the more important if we consider that some Member States do not yet have a systematic law on asylum. I note with regret that harmonisation of asylum procedures has been deferred for two years, meaning that it will be implemented in 2012. We must put an end to the awful disparity that exists between the Member States and the different asylum systems. We are at present in a paradoxical situation whereby recognition rates of candidates to refugee status for certain third country nationals vary from approximately 0% up to 90% depending on which Member State receives the request.\nHarmonisation of standards should result in a high level of protection throughout the EU and should not be based on the lowest common denominator. The institution of asylum is an essential part of our democracy and the protection of human rights, and it is unacceptable that it has been severely eroded in recent years, as the needs of asylum seekers and the principle of ", "24. European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion (\nBefore the vote:\nMarie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached an agreement with the Council and the Commission concerning Amendments 37 and 52. The compromise refers respectively to the financing of small non-governmental organisations and the maximum level of financing of NGOs. The Commission and the Council have agreed to include a statement with the first-reading agreement and I would like to ask the Commissioner, whom I do not see here, but he made the declaration last night during the discussion; he presented the statement included with the agreement... I do not know if there is anyone here who wants to present the agreement on behalf of the Commission. In any case, I would like to ask my colleagues, provided that they agree with this statement, to vote in favour of the report so that we can proceed with the first reading vote.\n", "2. The role of NATO in the security architecture of the EU (\n- Before the vote:\nAri Vatanen\nrapporteur. - Madam President, I apologise for taking up everyone's time and delaying lunch but I do it only once in 10 years so maybe you will not mind. In fact I am like the Member of the Finnish Parliament who rose to speak only once in all his years in the Finnish Parliament and what he said was: 'could you close the window, please'.\nI would like to say a few words in relation to these three reports, which are all part of the same package, which includes the reports by Mr von Wogau and Mr Saryusz-Wolski. At the moment we are looking for solutions to the financial crisis. That was self-inflicted and we are saying this crisis must not be repeated, but what about the raison d'\u00eatre of the European Union to prevent wars and human crises? They must not be repeated either, and they do not fall on us like the roof in the Parliament building in Strasbourg. They need not be repeated, but only on the condition that we work together.\nI remind you that peace is not the monopoly of this side of the House. Peace belongs to everybody. Peace-building is our common duty. It is a little bit like love. It is unconditional. We have to be idealistic in this life. We have to look far away, like when we run in a forest. You do not look at your feet when you run in a forest. You look far away and then you know where you are going and you automatically put your feet in the right place. That is what we have to do. We have to be brutally honest and remember why the EU was formed: it was to build peace.\nAll I am saying now is that, if we are to respect the inheritance of Mr Monnet and our forefathers, we should belong to just one party and that party regarding peace-building is called the '\"Yes I Can\u201d Party'. Only then will history give us a standing ovation. And the window is open.\nAri Vatanen\nrapporteur. - Madam President, I am sorry to take up Parliament's time. I simply wish to delete the followi", "4. The situation concerning the President of the World Bank\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on four motions for resolutions on the situation concerning the President of the World Bank.\nBernd Posselt\n(DE) Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of my group. Under the Rules of Procedure, three debates on human rights issues are held within one hour on Thursday afternoon - and solely on cases of violations of human rights, democracy and the rule of law. This is a fourth debate, and it has nothing to do with democracy or human rights.\nTherefore, we are of the opinion that this constitutes an infringement of the Rules of Procedure - which not even the Conference of Presidents may disregard.\nThus my group formally proposes that this item be discontinued immediately.\nPresident\nI take note of your statement, Mr Posselt. Since the Conference of Presidents, in full knowledge of the facts, has decided to schedule four topics for debate today, I can do no more than take note of your statement and forward it to the President, who will consider how best to respond to it.\nThat having been said, this item clearly cannot be carried forward. You are familiar with the rules, according to which items not taken today under the heading of debates on matters of topical and urgent importance lapse, and so, if you are absolutely insistent on this item not being discussed today, it will lapse and will not be taken forward to the mini-session.\nJohn Bowis\nMr President, on a point of order, you said that the Conference of Presidents had decided this under the Rules of Procedure. Could you tell me under which rule they were enabled to extend this item to have four rather than three debates?\nMarios Matsakis\nMr President, there has been a decision by the Conference of Presidents to follow this particular procedure. These matters have been placed on the agenda and I think that we should continue. I do not see why we are prevented from continuing our work.\nPervenche Ber\u00e8s\n(FR) It may well be, Mr", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nFabre-Aubrespy\nMadam President, I have a point concerning page 20 of the Minutes. At the end of the debate on the eight reports on discharge - when you were in the Chair - there is a reference to a remark by me that 'although it was true that the Council had not attended the whole debate, neither had all the rapporteurs been present to hear the Council speak' . This only records part of what I said.\nI pointed out that although the absence of the Council and the Commission had been noted at the start of the debate, it was unsatisfactory that four of the eight rapporteurs were not present during the Commissioner's reply. I also stated that rapporteurs, when they accept reports, should undertake to be present at the debate on those reports. I should like those details to be included in the Minutes.\n\nPresident\nI can testify to what you say, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy. That will therefore be corrected.\n(Parliament approved the Minutes)\n\nEuropean Council in Turin\nPresident\nThe next item is the report by the Council and statement by the Commission on the outcome of the meeting of the European Council in Turin on 29/30 March 1996.\nIt gives me great pleasure to welcome to the European Parliament the Presidentin-Office of the Council, Prime Minister Lamberto Dini.\nMr President-in-Office, the floor is yours.\n\nDini\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Turin European Council marked an important new stage on the road to determining the nature of the process of European integration in the future. Last December in Madrid, the European Council decided that the Intergovernmental Conference was worthy of a solemn inauguration and that this very delicate series of meetings should start with an indication of the political priorities as agreed at the highest level. From this point of view the Turin European Council fully achieved the objective we had set ourselves. In fact, the ", "Gender aspects of the economic downturn and financial crisis - Assessment of the results of the 2006-2010 Roadmap for Equality between women and men and forward looking recommendations - Charter for Women's Rights - follow up (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on:\nthe report by Mr Romeva i Rueda, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on gender aspects of the economic downturn and financial crisis,\nthe report by Mrs Figueiredo, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on assessment of the results of the 2006-2010 Roadmap for Equality between women and men and forward-looking recommendations [2009/2242 (INI)], and\nthe oral question to the Commission by Mrs Gurmai and Mrs Thomsen, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, Mrs Figueiredo and Mrs Svensson, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, Mrs Parvanova, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and Mrs Cornelissen, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance on the Charter for Women's Rights - follow up - B7-0305/2010).\nRa\u00fcl Romeva i Rueda\nMr President, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to discuss this issue. Allow me to begin with a question; a very simple question, but one which I think highlights the problem that we are talking about very well: if we had had Lehman Sisters instead of Lehman Brothers, would we be here today talking about this? We do not know because that is not the case, but what is clear is that the situation would have been very different from the one that we have today in the context of the credit crunch and the economic and financial crisis.\nThere is an extremely clear consensus among economists, both feminist and non-feminist, that the current crises have been caused by a series of institutions that are fundamentally, basically, run by men. We therefor", "Situation in Gaza (debate) \nPresident\nAs the next item we have the statements on the situation in Gaza by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and by the Commission.\nJavier Solana\nEU High Representative for CFSP. - (ES) Thank you, Mr President, for giving me the floor in this important debate which we are about to begin.\nMr President, we are opening a debate on tragic events which have unfolded over recent weeks and days: the issue of Gaza, the issue of the borders between Gaza and Egypt and the border crossing points between Gaza and Israel.\nThe outcome witnessed by us in recent days is tragic: there has been a very sharp deterioration in the humanitarian situation and even the security situation has worsened considerably.\nI believe that today's debate should be a debate on how we can contribute to resolving problems.\nWe have had many debates in this Chamber on the problems of the past, and I believe that today we should see if we in the European Union are able to contribute to resolving this major issue (because it will also have an impact on the Annapolis Conference and the peace process).\nI would like to point out once again that we, the European Union, have been consistent in calling for the border crossings to be opened and for there to be free movement of people and goods, subject to security guarantees, not only goods for humanitarian aid purposes, but goods which may assist in the economic development of the region, more specifically, the West Bank and Gaza.\nIf those three basic elements - political development, economic development and changes in the situation on the ground - are lacking, it will be very difficult for us to move forward. Progress in these three fields must be made and that progress must be made in all three at the same time.\nWhat can we Europeans do?\nSince the emergence of this new situation we have been in constant contact with the key players.\nAs you know, on Sunday there was an important meeting of the Arab", "EU/China summit - EU/China human rights dialogue (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the EU-China summit.\nBenita Ferrero-Waldner\nMember of the Commission. - Madam President, I welcome today's debate about the EU-China human rights dialogue. As you know, the human rights issue was raised and discussed at the very recent summit meeting in Beijing and the joint statement also explicitly refers to it.\nI think it is fair to recognise that, although serious concerns remain and need to be addressed, China has also made remarkable progress in the human rights field over the last year. This is particularly true in the field of social and economic rights but also in some other areas.\nThere are moves afoot to reform the 're-education through labour' system. In this respect we welcome the new legislative initiative that is under consideration and we also hope that concrete reforms will be put in place soon. It is a fundamental principle of human rights not to deprive an individual of his or her liberty without due justice and a fair trial.\nChina is also working to implement the recommendations of the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture. For example, the Ministry of Justice has recently directed courts not to rely on confessions on their own as sufficient evidence of guilt, as such confessions can sometimes be made as a result of torture by police or detention personnel. Similarly, China is initiating specific training measures targeted at these groups of public order personnel.\nWe are also pleased to note the progress made with respect to the Supreme People's Court now exercising full review power over death penalty sentences issued by lower courts. And we understand that the result is a reduction in the number of effective death sentences and executions. This is gratifying for the European Union. As you know, it has long been a priority area of intervention.\nNevertheless - and now of course I also have to say a few negative things - the Commission rem", "Statements by the President\nPresident\nLast Friday in Warsaw we inaugurated the first Polish Presidency of the European Council in the presence of President Van Rompuy and President Barroso. The European Parliament expects that it will be as amenable to our Parliament as the Hungarian Presidency. On Wednesday morning, Prime Minister Donald Tusk will present the Polish Presidency's work programme, so we will meet the Polish Presidency on Wednesday morning.\nThere are two pieces of news concerning our nearest neighbours. We are following events in the EU's closest neighbours. In a referendum held on Friday, the citizens of Morocco approved amendments to the constitution strengthening the democratic nature of the country's regime. However, these reforms must continue and be farther-reaching, so that they reflect the true aspirations of Moroccans. I would like to add that representatives from the European Parliament were present as observers during the election.\nThe next issue concerning our neighbours is as follows. During yesterday's peaceful demonstrations which took place in many towns throughout Belarus, hundreds of people were arrested and have been put on trial today. The European Parliament supports the citizens of Belarus in their efforts to enjoy freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. We demand the immediate and unconditional release of all those arrested and sentenced for political reasons.\n", "'made in' (origin marking) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on 'made in' (origin marking).\nCatherine Ashton\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, I am happy to have the opportunity today to address you in plenary session on the proposal for a regulation on origin marking. This is a proposal which honourable Members may recall the Parliament has been a strong supporter of since its adoption by the College as long ago as December 2005. I particularly recall your resolution of July 2006 and the written declaration of September 2007. I was privileged to discuss this issue last month in Strasbourg with a group of MEPs who stressed to me the need to move rapidly to adopt this regulation.\nI think honourable Members would agree that it is of fundamental importance that trade policy not only strengthens the opportunities that open markets can offer but also addresses the concerns globalisation generates not just for consumers, but also, and perhaps particularly, for small enterprises.\nOrigin marking should therefore be considered in that spirit. In the 2007 declaration, you emphasised the right of European consumers to have clear and immediate information about their purchases. That is precisely what this regulation is about. It aims to allow EU consumers to be fully aware of the country of origin of the products that they purchase.\nThe Commission has proposed a compulsory indication of the country of origin of certain products imported into the European Union from third countries. Not all products are covered - we focused on those of real interest, following a broad consultation with consumers and with industry.\nOrigin marking, I might add, is fully in line with the current WTO rules and principles and something that exists almost everywhere in the world. Imports into the United States, into Canada, China and Japan are subject to country of origin marking. As a matter of fact, most products that you can currently purchase in shops in the Eur", "Croatia: progress report 2008 - Turkey: progress report 2008 - Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: progress report 2008 (debate)\nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and the Commission statements on:\nCroatia: progress report 2008,\nTurkey: progress report 2008, and\nFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: progress report 2008.\nAlexandr Vondra\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, let me introduce the debate on the progress reports on the three countries Croatia, Turkey and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\nLet me begin with Croatia. Your report rightly states that Croatia made good progress over the past year. Since the start of the negotiations, 22 chapters - out of 35 - have been opened, of which seven have been provisionally closed. The Presidency will continue to take forward the negotiations. Two accession conferences in particular are planned: at deputy level in the coming weeks, and at ministerial level in June.\nYour report rightly highlights the importance of reaching a settlement to the outstanding border dispute with Slovenia. I would like to assure this Parliament that the Presidency will continue to make every effort to help resolve this issue and, in this context, we fully support the ongoing efforts of the Commissioner, Olli Rehn, to find a solution to allow us to continue with the accession negotiations. We had a lunch just before the sitting to discuss this in depth. Concerning the last development, we welcome Croatia's decision announced on Monday that it accepts the mediation proposed by the group of experts proposed by Olli Rehn. We are encouraging both Slovenia and Croatia to work constructively in order to find a permanent and mutually acceptable solution as a matter of urgency, because it should not be just a prescription for more delays.\nApart from this important issue, further progress in the wider negotiations depends, above all, on Croatia itself. The necessary political, economic, legislative and administrative ref", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n(The Minutes were approved)\n\nHallam\nMadam President, on a point of order. I just wish to draw the attention of this House to the agenda for this week, particular the agenda for Friday, when the only item on the agenda is the Hallam report...\nwhich is on the agri-monetary system for the single market, 1 July 1995 to 30 June 1996. Between you and me, Madam President, this is hardly earth-shattering news. I am wondering whether it might be wise for Parliament, rather than to have a half-hour debate on a Friday - I am very flattered we are having this debate - to bring it forward and have it with the Hardstaff report on Thursday, delay the vote until the following Wednesday in Brussels, and thereby save the taxpayers of Europe thousands of pounds by not opening this building on Friday.\n(Applause)\nPresident\nMr Hallam, you have raised a delicate point which has in fact been considered by the Conference of Presidents.\nYou will be aware that, because of an exceptional chain of events, yours is in actual fact the only item on the agenda for Friday. Nevertheless, colleagues have made arrangements, changed their flights and so on. It seems to me - and this is my personal opinion, the Conference of Presidents may, of course, look at the question again - but I think it would be extremely strange to alter our agenda so abruptly by missing a morning's plenary session.\nI do not doubt for an instant that after the powerful plea you have just made, Mr Hallam, all our colleagues here will be intent on attending the presentation of your report, to which I strongly invite them.\n\nDonnelly, Alan\nMadam President, on a point of order. It concerns the Rules of this House. As chairman of Parliament's Delegation for relations with the United States, I had arranged a meeting this morning with President Santer in advance of our visit next week to Washington to discuss those issues ", "\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 13 October 2005. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Before going on to talk to you as usual about the events that have taken place between two part-sessions, I must remind you that today is the 60th anniversary of the creation of the United Nations.\nOn this occasion, the European Parliament must consider what these years have taught us in terms of cooperation and dialogue and multilateral political action.\nThe message of the Secretary-General has been distributed in full to all of the Members of the European Parliament. In that message, Kofi Annan reminds us in no uncertain terms that the United Nations must reflect the times and, as such, should adapt to the developments that have taken place in the world since 1945.\nI would also like to remind you that last September a meeting took place in New York of Heads of State or Government to draw up an inventory of reforms and to set concrete commitments with a view to their implementation.\nThis Summit did not satisfy all of our expectations in this regard. We cannot say that the Resolution on it approved by the European Parliament has been taken fully into account. For this very reason, we must monitor the way this reform process progresses very closely.\nDuring our last plenary session we approved a third Resolution on the results of the September Summit and I would like to take advantage of this anniversary to express once again our determination that reforms such as the creation of a Human Rights Council or the Peace Consolidation Committee should become realities before the end of the 60th session of the General Assembly.\nOn this date the European Parliament reiterates its support for the actions of the United Nations and for the fundamental principles that govern it. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry to have to inform you of the death on 15 October of the former Member of the European Parliament, Matti Wuori.\nMatti Wuori was a Mem", "Formal sitting - 20th anniversary of the democratic change in Central and Eastern Europe\nPresident\nBefore we begin, I should like to say that I have exchanged views with President Havel, and I can assure you that we could not have imagined something like this 25 years ago!\n(Applause)\nV\u00e1clav Havel\nformer President of the Czech Republic. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for the invitation and for the opportunity to address you during the days marking the twentieth anniversary of the dramatic breaching of the sealed borders, the cutting of the barbed wire and the tearing down of the walls between European nations and, in the case of Germany, the wall that divided one and the same nation. It was the end of the bipolar division, not only of Europe but, to a considerable extent, of the whole world. It was a moment of such historical importance that many people felt that from then onwards, the world could only prosper.\nIt did not happen. History, of course, did not end. It is all the more important to embrace this anniversary not only as an appeal to reflect on the present but, first and foremost, as an appeal to think about the future. I would like to contribute to this appeal with five comments on the theme of European unification.\nNone of us were fully prepared for the surprisingly rapid fall of the Iron Curtain, nor could we have been. It would have been unnatural. A period of specific dilemmas, examinations of various alternatives and uncertainty therefore followed. Finally, NATO took the courageous step of allowing in new members, thereby guaranteeing their security and enabling them to concentrate on preparing for accession to the European Union. After that, the Union genuinely opened its doors to the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe. From time to time, there are various difficulties with these countries. That is quite understandable. A democratic political culture cannot be created or revived on a day to day basis.

It is a great pleasure for me to appear in this House to inform you of two issues which are related for obvious reasons.\nOn the one hand, the Fifth Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference which took place in Valencia yesterday and the day before yesterday, and on the other, the current situation in the Middle East, the latest events and the efforts being made to put the peace process back on track.\nIf you will allow me, I will begin by describing the contribution I believe this ministerial meeting has made and then end with some comments on the situation in the Middle East.\nI would firstly like to say that we all had doubts about whether or not this Euro-Mediterranean ministerial meeting would be able to take place, for obvious reasons: the situation in the Middle East presented enormous uncertainties and seri", "General revision of the Rules of Procedure (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Corbett, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the general revision of _Parliament's Rules of Procedure.\nRichard Corbett\nrapporteur. - Mr President, I intend to use somewhat less than my four minutes now in introducing it and maybe a little longer when I reply at the end, if there are questions that need clarification.\nThis report is the fruit of a lot of work. The sources of the reforms that we would hope to introduce to our Rules of Procedure come in part from the work of the Reform Working Group established by the Conference of Presidents, ably chaired by my colleague, Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, who made a number of proposals that were approved by the Conference of Presidents and have been forwarded to us to translate as best we can into the Rules of Procedure.\nThe second source is a lot of smaller changes that, in many ways, have been in the pipeline for a long time but, rather than have a string of reports changing the rules on minor points, we have grouped them together. Some of these are technical; some are clarifying and make our rules more readable, such as the one that puts together Rules 141, 142 and 143 into a single codified text governing how we actually organise our debates in plenary. Related to that is the innovative amendment to say that we should have this blue card procedure to be able to interrupt each other. Mr Duff for instance, right now, may want to put a question to me about what I said, and I would let him do so for 30 seconds under this rule, if it is adopted. I am sure, Mr President, you would already let him do so now if he wanted, but, fortunately, he does not want to.\nSo there are some innovative features that should make our debates a little more lively. I remember when I first proposed the catch-the-eye period at the end of ordinary debates, everyone said: oh, no, we cannot do that, it will mess up the speaking time of the ", "One-minute speeches (Rule 144) \nPresident\nThe next item is one-minute speeches.\nGy\u00f6rgy Sch\u00f6pflin\nMr President, the mounting crisis in relations between Estonia and Russia affects us all. What we have is a clear case of undue pressure by a large country against a small one. This is the kind of behaviour from which the European Union protects small states. Russia has persistently accused Estonia of nurturing something that it calls 'fascism', without producing a shred of evidence. The campaign brings the very idea of anti-fascism into disrepute, above all because Russia itself is behaving like a fascist state. The campaign dishonours the memory of those who really did fight fascism and especially those who gave their lives in that struggle, millions of Russians included. Anti-fascism means democracy and equality of respect for all. Russia, by contradicting this, is reviving fascism and thereby turning into a threat to Europe as a whole.\nProinsias De Rossa\nMadam President, I would like to raise a serious matter of EU funding being misused, in my view, for the destruction of archaeological heritage in Ireland. I appeal to Commissioner Dimas to intervene directly with Minister Roche in Ireland to ensure that these subsidies, which are being provided to build the N3 motorway in County Meath, are not facilitating the destruction of a recently discovered Neolithic site - a 'woodhenge'. This is an extremely important site, quite close to the historic Tara Hill. The Director of the National Museum in Ireland has called for a complete archaeological excavation, but, given that Minister Roche has been deaf to all expert advice so far, there is a real risk that this unique Neolithic site will be lost. In view of the European investment in this motorway project, it is essential that the Commission step in to ensure that a significant part of not only Irish heritage, but by definition also part of European heritage, is properly excavated, and that if necessary the N3 motorway be r", "3. European Training Foundation (recast) (\n- Before the vote on the Commission proposal\nBernard Lehideux\nrapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, we have had a great many conversations with the Commission and the Council with a view to reaching an agreement at first reading. The vote on this amendment calls that agreement into question. We will be forced to go to a second reading as it is evident, and the Council has so informed us, that it will not accept this position.\nI regret this situation and in face of this problem, which is not to disown a considerable part of the text we adopted with the first amendment but to keep our word to the Council, I recommend abstention.\nPresident\nWe duly note what you have said but will nonetheless continue with the vote.\n", "1. Coup in Mauritania\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution on the coup in Mauritania.\nAlain Hutchinson\nauthor. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, we can regard the coup d'\u00e9tat that has taken place in Mauritania as a real tragedy. Just as it has invested in many other countries, the European Union has invested enormously in the democratisation of Mauritania; more than this, and even more importantly I would say, the Mauritanian people have contributed significantly and those responsible for the relatively recent overthrow of the dictator Taya succeeded in arousing huge hopes among the population of that country, while at the same time honouring each of their commitments from the organisation of the constitutional referendum in June 2006 to the presidential elections in March 2007, including the holding of local and general elections in 2006. This long process gave everyone an opportunity to have their say: trade unions, civil society and, of course, politicians. After just one year this coup has shattered everything and there is huge disappointment among the ranks of the democrats.\nThis catastrophe for democracy and for the people of Mauritania clearly reminds us of the extreme fragility of all young democracies and also of the special attention that has to be paid to them. It is now vital for us to condemn the new Mauritanian regime without equivocation. If the elected President had committed mistakes or blunders it was up to the Mauritanian people, to its parliament and to the country's elected representatives to react, to criticise and to impose sanctions. It was not in any way whatsoever the right of the army, the gendarmerie or any other police force to involve itself in what is exclusively a political matter.\nWe are therefore calling on the new 'strong men' of Mauritania to restore to the people of Mauritania the powers that they have stolen from them. We demand that they allow the elected President to resume his political funct", "EU framework for coordinating national Roma integration strategies (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the declaration by the Commission on the EU framework for coordinating national Roma integration strategies.\nViviane Reding\nVice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, I am presenting, together with my colleague, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Andor, the decision which the Commission has taken to present a new framework for national Roma integration strategies.\nThe EU framework comes at a moment when the situation of Roma has become a real focus of attention in Europe. The EU has made available to the Member States a range of legal, policy and financial instruments to address the situation of the Roma. We also have a whole legal framework based on non-discrimination, free movement of people and the enlargement strategy. However it is very clear that the economic and social marginalisation of the Roma persists, and this is neither acceptable nor sustainable in the European Union of the 21st century.\nParliament, with support from across the whole political spectrum - and I would like to underline this - has drawn attention to the urgency of promoting the integration of Roma, through its recently adopted resolution on the EU Roma strategy. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs J\u00e1r\u00f3ka, for her excellent work.\nDetermined action is needed, both at national and at European level. We need to join forces and step up our efforts to end discrimination against Roma and make sure they enjoy the same rights as any other European citizens, because that is what they are. When I say that, I of course have in mind a two-way process which requires a change in the mindset of the majority of our European citizens and of members of the Roma communities.\nWe all agree that there is a need for effective policy planning and implementation as well as for a strategic common approach. We all know that the primary responsibility for the integration of Roma lies with the Member States.

I would also like to welcome President Barroso.\nThe next item is the joint debate on:\nthe Council statement on the results of the Swedish Presidency;\nthe European Council report and Commission statement on the outcome of the European Council on 10 and 11 December 2009.\nFredrik Reinfeldt\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I am grateful for this opportunity to address the European Parliament once again and at such a crucial time.\nAs we speak, representatives from 193 countries are gathered in a conference centre in Copenhagen, talking, arguing, negotiating and trying to meet the expectations of millions of people around the world. In just two days, the UN climate conference will be over. Soon we will be looking back at a meeting that was crucial, not only for the EU but for the world; a meeting that was decisive for those who cannot grow their crops because of a lack of water, decisive for those who have lost their homes in tornadoes or floods, and decisive for those who are vainly building walls against a sea level that rises every year.\nWe know what is at risk, so why is it then so difficult to act? Is it because we fear any change of our way of life? Still, we know that if we keep on using the world's resources the way we do, our current way of life will no longer be an option and we will face even more drastic changes. We have much greater things than our everyday comfort to fear.\nThe fight against climate change has been at the top of the agenda throughout the Swedish Presidency, at all our European Council meetings and in all our summits with the Union's major partners. As you probably know, we adopted a comprehensive mandate at our October European Council to keep the EU's leading position in the climate nego", "Protection of the Communities' financial interests - Fight against fraud - Annual Report 2008 (debate) \nPresident\nThe last item is the report by Mr Cozzolino, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the protection of the Communities' financial interests and the fight against fraud - Annual report 2008.\nAndrea Cozzolino\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when the Treaty of Lisbon is giving Europe a more incisive role in the lives of millions of Europeans, the challenge of transparency and legality is crucial. Hence the report that we are presenting is the result of a highly coordinated effort. The work was confined, first and foremost, to the scenario outlined by the Court of Auditors, whereby the financial impact of irregularities fell from more than EUR 1 billion in 2007 to EUR 783 million in 2008.\nThe fall concerns all spending areas except direct expenditure and pre-accession funds. Areas of major concern still exist in relation to the Structural Funds too. However, absolute amounts and values alone do not tell us where the urgent problems are hidden and where the situation is under control. Our analyses and meetings over recent months have led us to prioritise two requirements. Firstly, the urgent need to make the Member States more responsible for identifying fraud and irregularities, and for sharing the information needed to combat fraud, waste and distortions in expenditure and in the collection of taxes.\nSecondly, the importance of presenting proposals and working hypotheses in order to make it easier to implement measures in the Member States, with administrative procedures and management strategies that give priority to the quality of the projects and to their impact on the living and working conditions of European citizens.\nIn order to achieve these objectives, we propose that Parliament insist on certain priorities: firstly, we propose that OLAF draw up 27 profiles, analysing with due care and attention the strategies followed by e", "3. Defence of the principle of subsidiarity (vote) \nMartin Schulz\n(DE) Madam President, I would like to repeat my point of order:\n(Uproar in the Chamber)\nI am pleased that I am always able to wake my fellow Members up. This is good for the circulation.\nOnce again, under the terms of Rule 177(4), I request that the vote is postponed and that the legitimacy of the resolution and the vote is investigated in the meantime.\nManfred Weber\n(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to look at the procedural argument. I would like to remind everyone that we have just voted on the Cashman report. This is a report created by Parliament in the course of an ongoing legislative procedure. Our Legal Service has stated that this is not permitted, but the socialists insisted on introducing it. While we were discussing the freedom of the press in Italy and the Commissioner responsible explained that the European Union has no authority in this area, the socialists still felt that it was worthwhile to attack Berlusconi. Whenever it suits the socialists, it is a question of there being no authority. Whenever other people are being opposed, the authority is in place. For this reason, we should not give in to them.\nHowever, the second argument is worthy of serious discussion. Are we responsible for the Convention on Human Rights? I would like to remind my fellow Members that, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union will become party to the Convention on Human Rights. This means that if it is legitimate for the Italian Parliament to discuss this, because Italy is party to the Convention on Human Rights, then it is also legitimate for the European Parliament to discuss this, as it will be party to the Convention on Human Rights in future.\nMy third and final argument concerns the fact that we are not lawyers, we are politicians. This judgment affects millions of people and, therefore, we should vote on it today.\n(Applause)\n", "Welcome\nPresident\nI would like to inform you that we have with us in the official gallery Mr Ranko Krivokapic, President of the Parliament of the Republic of Montenegro, and Mrs Gordana Djurovic, Deputy Prime Minister for European Integration.\n(Applause)\nAs you know, the first interparliamentary meeting between the European Parliament and Montenegro is being held today, and we wish our guests the very best of luck at the meetings being held with us here in Parliament.\nThank you for attending our sitting.\n", "Short selling and certain aspects of credit default swaps (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Canfin, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation on Short Selling and certain aspects of Credit Default Swaps - C7-0264/2010 -.\nPascal Canfin\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, this report concerns short selling and the supervision of credit default swaps, those products that insure debt against default, in particular state default.\nThe origins of this text lie in the Greek crisis, which began in spring 2010. Following certain movements on the financial markets that had been observed, a political request was put to Commissioner Barnier and to the European Commission to establish European rules on short selling and on sovereign debt speculation tools. The Commission drafted that regulation in September. This was followed by the adoption of our position in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in March, and of the Council position in May. Since then we have been negotiating, because we have already had five trialogues, which have enabled us to reach a number of possible compromises. Although they are not here, I should like to thank the representatives of the Hungarian Presidency who took part in these trialogues and helped to move this matter forward.\nHowever, after those four or five negotiating sessions, we and the shadow rapporteurs who voted by a majority for this text in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs - in other words, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, which I represent - took the decision to vote in the July part-session for this text, but not for the legislative proposal, in order to send two messages. The first message consists in saying that we want to carry on negotiating", "2.

Please put my vote in favour.\n", "Implementation of Directive 2002/14/EC establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European Community (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is a short presentation of the report by Mr Cottigny, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the implementation of Directive 2002/14/EC establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European Community.\nJean Louis Cottigny\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the various shadow rapporteurs for their open-minded work during our collaboration on this text in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.\nThe Member States must improve the implementation of the directive on informing and consulting employees, particularly in the current context of the financial crisis and of its consequences for companies as they restructure, merge or move abroad. This is the message the Committee on Employment was seeking to send out in this initiative report.\nThe European Union has 23 million companies with fewer than 250 employees. They represent 99% of companies and employ over 100 million people. Workers' rights to information and consultation are essential components of the social market economy.\nThe transposition of Directive 2002/14/EC has been considerably delayed in some Member States. In this own-initiative report, we point out that the impact of this directive is evident in the countries where no general system of worker information and consultation existed.\nI am calling for an improved transposition of the directive in the Member States. We ask that the Commission takes measures, as soon as possible, to ensure the proper transposition of this directive by the Member States, and to bring infringement proceedings against those that have either not transposed it at all or have done so incorrectly.\nThe report also emphasises that, in their transposition measures, some Member States have not included ", "Rights-based management tools in fisheries (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Attwooll on rights-based management tools in fisheries.\nElspeth Attwooll\nrapporteur. - Madam President, my thanks are due to the shadow rapporteurs and all on the Fisheries Committee for producing a well-balanced report on what is a very complex and in many ways sensitive issue.\nIn some public debate, rights-based management is equated with the employment of individual transferable quotas. The report takes a much broader view, treating the term as covering any of the forms that can be taken by the right to harvest fish, given that these are seen as a common public good. So understood, it is clear that there is a variety of such forms currently in operation throughout the EU. For example, the extent of the right may be specified by reference to the territory to be fished, the amount of fish to be harvested, the effort allowed or some mixture of these. Similarly, although the right is implicitly transferable, there are various limitations in this respect. For example, that from Community to Member States is conditioned by the principle of relative stability. Further, there seems to be a considerable range of such limitations. One particular form of divergence between Member States is how far transfer for economic value is permitted, either formally or informally, and thus amounts to a tradable right.\nThe central issue is, then, how fisheries management should engage in constituting the right to harvest in order best to obtain the objectives of the common fisheries policy. The Commission communication raises the question of the extent to which a single system might be introduced, either at Community level or by harmonising the practice of Member States. The report of the Fisheries Committee details a number of concerns about the adverse impacts that certain types of rights-based management might have, but also touches on the manner in which some of these might be prevented", "Bosnia and Herzegovina (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\u0160tefan F\u00fcle\nMember of the Commission. - Madam President, it is a pleasure to start with Cathy still here when we were both just discussing a couple of messages that could be shared with you. I wish to thank the European Parliament for the opportunity to make this statement on Bosnia and Herzegovina at this crucial moment for the country.\nI share your views regarding the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The political situation has deteriorated and reforms are progressing slowly. 2010 is an election year and some political leaders are engaged in divisive rhetoric. In addition, the economic crisis makes the situation even more difficult.\nOn the other hand, stability and security are not at risk, according to the reports of EUFOR and EUPM. Let me reassure you that, in these difficult times, the European Union stays fully committed to Bosnia and Herzegovina's European future. I share this personal commitment with the High Representative, Baroness Ashton. Our goal is a stable Bosnia and Herzegovina, firmly on its way towards the European Union, and we will provide all our support to reach this goal.\nHowever, it is up to the country's authorities to use all available tools and to make all possible efforts to make this happen. Otherwise, the country risks falling behind the rest of the region. We can both say - Cathy Ashton can be a witness - that the high-level meeting in Sarajevo on 2 June reaffirmed the unequivocal European perspective for the Western Balkans based, firstly, on meeting the Copenhagen criteria and, secondly, the conditionality of the Stabilisation and Association Process.\nThe high-level meeting was also an opportunity for the European Union to underline the importance of regional cooperation and to encourage positive steps towards reconciliation to be undertaken by neighbouring countries in the region. Together with all European Union interl", "Women and science (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Thomsen, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on women and science.\nStavros Dimas\nMr President, let me first of all express my gratitude to the European Parliament and especially to the rapporteur, Mrs Thomsen, for their support for the Commission policy on women and science. I should also like to thank the rapporteur from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Mr Dover, for his constructive approach.\nWe agree with Mrs Thomsen's explanatory statement that the elimination of gender discrimination in science heralds a new era of excellence for European research and academic growth, and a boost for innovation. The Commission is well aware that there is a serious imbalance between female and male researchers. The latest available statistics show that whereas women represent more than 50% of graduates in all university departments, only 15% of professors are women. In the field of science, engineering and technology, the corresponding figures are 34% female graduates and 9% female professors. The Commission agrees that this is a serious waste of talent and resources, as it is contrary to the principle of equality.\nSince 1999, the European Commission has been attending to the issue of the lack of women in research. In the Fifth Framework Programme, the Commission gave financial support to studies and projects in the field of women and science. Since 2003, the Commission has also been publishing the 'She Figures' statistics, which show the participation of women in European research. The next issue will be published in 2009.\nMore to the point, in her report, Mrs Thomsen supports the target of at least 40% women and 40% men on the various committees under the Framework Programme. This non-binding target has been in place since 2000 and has brought very good results. For example, women's participation in committees evaluating research work has increased from 10% in ", "\n\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is the statement by the Commission on the textile industry. \nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs,\n\u00a0\u00a0 . Mr President, the European textile and clothing industry is, and will remain, an essential part of the EU's industrial and social fabric. The figures speak for themselves: around 2.5 million employees, about 4% of EU GNP. There has been a significant reduction in employment in the sector over the past years. That is unavoidable in an increasingly open world economy, but this fact is of no consolation to the worker who loses his or her job.\nThe role of the Commission and the European Union as such is to provide a predictable framework for the European producers and importers in the context of an open economy. However, this framework must be a compromise between widely differing objectives. On the one hand, we must and will ensure continued protection of our industry against unfair trade practices. Also, if there are genuinely unforeseeable and major surges in imports, the European Commission should be ready to provide temporary relief to the European textile and clothing industry without neglecting other interests at stake, such as those of importers, traders and distribution or of industry that is sourcing abroad.\nOn the other hand, we must respect our commitments to China and help it to become a responsible WTO member. China, provided it avoids unfair trade practices, is entitled to enjoy the benefits of its comparative advantages and its WTO accession, while managing its integration into the global economy in a way that avoids trade disruption. This is what we have called the 'smooth transition'.\nAs far as the textile and clothing sector is concerned, the scene for what is happening today was set a decade ago. It was agreed during the Uruguay Round that we would gradually abolish the remaining quantitative restrictions on imports in the textile and clothing sector by 1 January 2005, after a decade of transition. However, few anticipated the scale and spee", "4.

As provided in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, a referendum took place in January 2011 which represented the final stage of the process leading to the independence of South Sudan from North Sudan.\nSouth Sudan is an area with approximately 10 million inhabitants, covering almost a quarter of the land area of Sudan as currently constituted and possessing about three-quarters of its oil reserves. It is a state that will have to cope with huge geographical and infrastructural limitations, without an outlet to the sea and with a practically non-existent transport network connecting it to northern Sudan, where the oil treatment and transit plant is located. The challenges the South faces are many, beginning with laying the foundations of its own institutions and improving the socio-economic and security frameworks.\nI should note, however, that intervention in this country remains a priority for the European Union. Therefore, in 2010, the Council accorded Sudan a special allocation of EUR 150 million for the period 2011-2013. The European Union must mobilise the entire panoply of instruments at its disposal to support South Sudan in the delicate post-referendum phase. At the same time, we need to maintain a balanced approach in dealing with the North and the South of the country, with particular attention being paid to the needs of the South in terms of institution building and governance.\nEuropean Union aid to South Sudan should be commensurate with what the new state can effectively absorb. We must avoid the situation in which future funding flows to Juba end up being improperly deployed or, even worse, feeding the existing high level of corruption.\nLena Ek\n(SV) Mr President, Sudan is currently in a very sensitive phase ahead of ", "Protection of minorities in Europe (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the protection of traditional national, ethnic and immigrant minorities in Europe, by Csaba S\u00e1ndor Tabajdi, Hannes Swoboda, Jan Marinus Wiersma, V\u00e9ronique De Keyser, Katrin Saks and Claude Moraes, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament - B6-0005/2009).\nCsaba S\u00e1ndor Tabajdi\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are more than 300 different national and ethnic minorities and linguistic communities living on the European continent. Of the citizens of the 27 EU Member States, some 15% are members of a traditional national minority or immigrant community. While the objective of the European Union is the preservation of cultural diversity, minority languages and groups face the threat of extinction or assimilation. The steadily growing immigrant communities are dealing with a crisis of integration; think only of the riots in the French suburbs, in the outskirts of Paris, the London terrorist attacks or the ethnic tensions in the Netherlands.\nIs the European Union credible when it condemns violations of human and minority rights in third countries? Are the EU decision makers adequately addressing the problems of national and ethnic minorities in the potential candidate countries of the Western Balkans, when some Member States are incapable of doing so at home, and in fact their practices are diametrically opposed to this policy? Those who are unable and unwilling to face these questions, who stick their heads in the sand, are playing with the future of Europe.\nToday's debate was preceded by voices of concern, with certain people claiming that this issue is too sensitive. Yes, this question is an extremely sensitive one. What would become of the European Union if we were to debate only those questions that do not offend any interests? We cannot sweep these problems under the carpet! The citizens of Europe expect us to provide g", "\n\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in the Middle East. \nBenita Ferrero-Waldner,\n\u00a0\u00a0 . Mr President, it is a great honour to address you today on the Middle East peace process. It is particularly timely, since I have just returned from a visit to Gaza, the West Bank and Israel.\nI had three objectives for this trip: first, to lend support to democracy-building in the run-up to the Palestinian elections. There is an important Election Observation Mission there with your colleague, Mrs\u00a0De\u00a0Keyser; secondly, to underline the importance of European Union financial support to the Palestinian people, and, thirdly, to thus raise the visibility of a number of EU projects, notably in Gaza.\nI spent a whole day in Gaza. The security situation there is very complicated, it was not easy to go in but in the end it was a good day and I hope that the images brought to the Palestinian people show how much we, the European Union, are standing by them.\nIt is a critical moment in the Middle East. In both Israel and the Palestinian territories, there have been tremendous changes in the political landscape. I hope that these elections will bring about two leaderships that are ready and able to inject new vigour into this peace process.\nI made it clear to both Israelis and Palestinians that the Commission will continue to offer its support to all those who seek peace by peaceful means. That means in particular that whatever the composition of the new Palestinian Government, there must be full respect for the principles enshrined in the Interim Association Agreement and in the Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan that we agreed with the Palestinian Authority. These principles include respect for human rights and the rule of law, and thus a clear commitment to the roadmap.\nThe Palestinian Authority has given the international community assurances that the elections will take place free from violence and intimidation and according to international standards; w", "Sudan and South Sudan (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the declaration by the Vice-President of the Commission and EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on Sudan and South Sudan (2011/2717 [RSP]).\nI think Mr Piebalgs is standing in for her. Thank you, Mr Piebalgs. Commissioner, you have the floor on behalf of the High Representative and the Commission.\nAndris Piebalgs\nMember of the Commission, on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission and EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Madam President, the six-year transition period of the Sudanese Comprehensive Peace Agreement will come to an end in about a month's time. This is a historic moment for Sudan, and indeed for the whole African continent. The people of Southern Sudan have waited a long time for this moment, when their country's independence will be declared on 9 July. The European Union will be represented at the Independence Day ceremony by the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission.\nFollowing a credible referendum at the beginning of this year, we commended Sudanese parties on the remarkable job they did in organising the referendum. We welcomed that President Bashir had publicly said that North Sudan would be the first to recognise an independent South Sudan. But the positive momentum of the immediate post-referendum period has vanished. There are worrying tendencies towards increased tensions and conflict. The recent violent clashes in and around Abyei could well lead to another military confrontation between North and South Sudan.\nWe discussed Sudan in the Foreign Affairs Council, both in January and in May, and will revert to it at the 20 June Foreign Affairs Council. At the Council, the High Representative intends to present a comprehensive EU strategic approach for Sudan, mainly focusing on an independent South Sudan, but also including elements for constructive engagement with North Sudan, including the Transitional Areas,", "Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes\nIsabelle Durant\n(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to draw your attention to the fact that, on your desks, you will find a file concerning the Lux Prize, a film prize that you are going to award.\nI wish to remind you that you have an opportunity to vote. You have an obligation to vote to choose one of the three films in the competition. You have in your file a programme on the films being shown. You also have a DVD of the film that won the prize in 2007, which has been translated into 23 languages, plus another seven. The idea is that everyone can watch these films in the European Union.\nI am asking you to do two things: firstly, to go and watch the films; and, secondly, to vote. It is very easy to vote: you have the procedure in your file; you can vote on the website and you can also watch the films on channel 77 on your television.\nI am asking you to watch these films. They are fine works, which convey European values. You must choose one, two or three. It is up to you to give your verdict; it is important that this House votes clearly and in large numbers. I am therefore asking you to take part in this vote. This is a fine initiative. It is a citizens' initiative, which seeks to promote European values and European film makers.\nIt is your turn; you still have a week, next week, in which to vote. I am counting on you.\nI am grateful to the Chairman of the Committee on Culture and Education, Mrs Pack, who contributed a great deal on this issue.

It failed. That is regrettable. However, whether the referendum would comply with democratic standards was also an important question. Crucially, its effective compliance has been confirmed by the international observers. This is an encouraging sign.\nThe elections of 28 November are equally important for the consolidation of democracy in the country. We will continue sending firm messages in that respect to all stakeholders. Thereafter, all political forces will have to work together, both to elect a President and to choose a government capable of taking the country through a critical reform path.\nAt the same time, we will sustain our unwavering support to the structural reforms conducted by the Moldovan Government. Let me highlight a few important aspects.\nThe European Union is not only by far the largest donor to Moldova, but in March also succeeded in mobilising over forty donors to support Moldova's reforms. They pledged an impressive EUR 1.9 billion for the years 2010-2013, including our own EUR 550 million commitment.\nOver the last months, we have provided timely responses to a number of the government's specific needs: providing high-level policy advice to ministers; supporting democratisation efforts in rule-of-law related areas; helping organise the electoral consultations; addressing emergency needs after last summer's floods; and improving possibilities for Moldovan wine exports.\nAlongside the Moldovan govern", "3.

He was a committed parliamentarian, and I had the honour of working with him in COSAC.\nThroughout his parliamentary career, Mr\u00a0Imbeni was always eager to share his values and his European ideals with fellow Members. He threw himself into his daily work, gaining the respect of his colleagues for his approach to conciliation and for his contribution to the many working groups in which he took part. Mr\u00a0Imbeni was also involved in the Mediterranean Forum and in COSAC, where, as I just mentioned, I was privileged to work alongside him.\nThe House is proud to have had him as a Member. Mr\u00a0Imbeni\u2019s work as Vice-President for a whole decade deserves particular recognition. We remember his wealth of knowledge, his generosity and his friendly smile. This was how he earned the respect of political friend and foe alike.\nMr\u00a0Imbeni served as Mayor of Bologna for many years, and he made a point of remaining in touch with his electorate and the citizens.\nI have sent a telegram to Mr\u00a0Imbeni\u2019s family, expressing condolences on behalf of the whole House.

Mr President, my party is keen on the continuing enlargement of the Union, and we look forward to our Bulgarian and Romanian colleagues joining us. We have paid close attention to the confirmation process of our two new Commissioners, and are satisfied that both are welcome additions to the College. I am pleased to support Mr Orban's appointment today.\nDavid Martin \nin writing. I welcome the appointment of a Bulgarian Member of the Court of Auditors and am glad that this proved uncontroversial in the light of other difficulties.\nDavid Martin \nin writing. I voted in favour of Mr Ispir despite allegations of corruption involving Mr Ispir being made in the Romanian media. The Committee on Budgetary Control could find no evid", "2010 progress report on Croatia (debate) \nPresident\n- The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the 2010 progress report on Croatia.\nYesterday I met with the Croatian Prime Minister, and I was accompanied by two representatives of key institutions of ours; Mr Swoboda, the rapporteur, and Mr H\u00f6kmark, the head of our permanent delegation to Croatia. We discussed the subject of Croatia's progress on its path towards the European Union. I am extremely pleased that today we can discuss the status of the negotiations and the outlook for Croatia's future in the European Union directly, with all our fellow Members present. I am also pleased that Commissioner F\u00fcle, who is responsible for our neighbourhood policy, is present in the Chamber. I would now like Mr Martonyi to take the floor on behalf of the Council. Mr Martonyi and the Hungarian Presidency attach a great deal of importance to enlarging the EU to include Croatia, and this is therefore an important item on the Hungarian Presidency's agenda. Please take the floor, Mr Martonyi.\nJ\u00e1nos Martonyi\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, on behalf of the Presidency of the European Union, may I say that it is a particular pleasure for me to address the plenary sitting of the European Parliament today.\nThis meeting provides a timely opportunity to review progress on Croatia's accession process and present the Hungarian Presidency's plans for this first semester of the year.\nFirst and foremost, I would like to welcome Parliament's active engagement with the enlargement process, and its constructive contribution to the general debate on enlargement and on Croatia's accession process in particular.\nAs we have underlined several times, enlargement reinforces peace, democracy and stability in Europe, serves the European Union's strategic interests and helps the EU to better achieve its policy objectives in important areas which are key to economic recovery and sustainable growth.\nEnlargement is a key d", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nMichl Ebner\n(DE) Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution and would especially like to thank Mr Brok for his efforts to achieve a broad consensus on it.\nI believe that, vital though it is to dialogue with Russia, we must ensure that we do not become totally or predominantly dependent on Russia in terms of energy policy, because that seriously diminishes our potential to hold discussions. It should not be forgotten that Georgia's military response relates back to a long history of provocation from the separatist forces, which has recently become very intense, and that Russia used this self-defence measure as grounds for the invasion. Nevertheless, we should make it our utmost priority to achieve a peaceful solution to this conflict and I wish all those involved speedy success, so that Crimea, Latvia, Lithuania and Kazakhstan do not also go the way of South Ossetia.\nDanutBudreikait\n(LT) European politicians are now breaking a long silence and are describing Russia's actions in Georgia as disproportionate. No, this is a case of the rights of Russians in other countries being protected by means of military aggression. Some EU countries that blocked the prospects of Georgia and Ukraine for joining NATO have enabled Russia to pursue its aggressive policy of annexing territories. Most EU countries are dependent on energy imports from Russia; they are afraid of the gas tap being turned off. This allows Russia to start dictating its conditions to the whole of the EU in a truly disproportionate way. I voted in favour of the resolution, although I feel that the position of both the Commission and Parliament with regard to future relations with Russia has not been defined clearly enough.\nMiroslav Mikol\u00e1\u0161ik\n(SK) I believe that we should terminate the visa liberalisation agreement, withdraw the Russian 'peacemaking' units and replace them with international ones and, thirdly, break off discussions on partnership and cooperat", "Welcome\nPresident\nToday we have great pleasure in welcoming to our Parliament a delegation from the parliament of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. This delegation visited our Parliament last December in Strasbourg, and we are delighted to welcome them in Brussels too.\n(Applause)\nLadies and gentlemen, I would like to express our deep and sincere condolences to your Assembly and to the Afghan people for the terrorist attack of 6 November 2007 in which six members of your parliament and about 100 Afghan citizens lost their lives. Among the victims was Sayed Mustafa Kazemi, who had been a member of the Afghan delegation on its visit to Strasbourg last year.\nThe purpose of your visit is to start a regular dialogue which will enable us to arrive more quickly at a better understanding of the political and social situation in Afghanistan, and which will give us the opportunity to discuss the assistance your country needs.\nI am confident that you all regard this visit as a symbol of our joint efforts to promote democratic values and full respect for human rights throughout the world.\nI would like to express our satisfaction at your visit, and our commitment to strengthening the cooperation between our governments.\nFrom what I know, you already have fruitful contacts with the European Parliament, and I wish you a constructive continuation of your mission, an enjoyable stay, and a good journey back to your country.\nGyula Hegyi\nMadam President, my point of order is under Rule 9(2), concerning the smooth conduct of parliamentary business.\nWe have been informed about the presence of asbestos in the Winston Churchill and SDM buildings in Strasbourg. The latest report 'has confirmed a more widespread presence of asbestos' than was initially believed in our places of work there. Asbestos is one of the most dangerous carcinogens, and can endanger human life. We should therefore request proper information on the risk assessment and detailed information on the removal of asbestos f", "Future of European aircraft construction (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on statements by the Council and the Commission on the future of European aircraft construction.\nPeter Hintze\nMr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, honourable Members, I am delighted to see that the subject of today's debate is the future of the European aerospace industry, for this industry embodies Europe's forward-looking approach, its high technology and its potential for future growth, and makes a considerable contribution to achieving the goals of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment, with Airbus being its most prominent project. Airbus is the name of a great idea - the idea of bringing together the technical capabilities of several European nations in order to build a strong aerospace enterprise that can hold its own on the global market. The story of Airbus is one of breathtaking success. Its aircraft - 4 600 of them have been delivered to date - represent European high technology on every airport in the world, thus playing a vital part in establishing an identity for Europe.\nAirbus does, however, also have serious problems. The year 2006 was one of both success and crisis for it. In that year, Airbus could not only take pride in the success of being the number one on the global market, but the company also suffered a massive crash in earnings as a result of serious delays in the rolling out of the new jumbo jet, the A380, and problems resulting from the weakness of the dollar, since Airbus is built for euros and sold in dollars.\nIt will also be necessary to reduce the development gap between the A350 XWB and its American competitor. Aircraft building is, after all, on the threshold of a technological revolution, as we move from the age of metal into the age of plastics, and that has been recognised more readily on the other side of the Atlantic than it has on our own. It is that sort of aircraft for which market demand exists.\nAirbus now wants to b", "Preparation of the European Council, including the situation of the global financial system (debate) \nPresident\n(EL) The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the preparation of the European Council, including the situation of the global financial system.\nJean-Pierre Jouyet\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Madam President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure you will understand how difficult it is to speak to Parliament immediately after such a moment of emotion, humanity and solidarity as we have just experienced with the personal account and call for action by Ingrid Betancourt.\nHowever, we need to come back to reality. The European Council meets on 15 and 16 October. This new session assumes particular importance at this time of crisis and instability, which calls for the expression of political will, initiatives and decisions from the European Union. The economic and financial situation will dominate the work of the European Council.\nAs I said to Parliament on 23 September, this crisis is not just an American crisis. It is now a European crisis. It is now an international crisis. The crisis of confidence in the markets and in our financial sector has got even worse over the last few days. The EU must shoulder its responsibilities.\nThe Council Presidency is determined to spare no effort on improving the coordination and coherence of national initiatives. It did so on Saturday with the meeting of the European members of the G7, in the presence of the Commission President, the Eurogroup president and the president of the European Central Bank. It did so yesterday at the Council of ministers of the economy and finance. It will do so again at the European Council on 15 and 16 October.\nWe have reached an agreement between Europeans on the need for close consultation about how each Member State manages the impact of the crisis on its own financial system. Dialogue within European is a concrete reality. There", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of the last sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nMcMahon\nMadam President, I refer to page 1 of yesterday's Minutes. Both Mr Smith and I raised the question of the list for Question Time and the fact that the questions we had tabled to Commissioner Kinnock on transport were not included in the transport section. We wondered whether there had been a simple administrative blunder or whether there had been some political manoeuvre to prevent embarrassment for the United Kingdom Government. The President in the chair, Mr Imbeni, said he would report the matter to the Commission. Has the presidency had any news from the Commission about what happened to these questions?\n\nPresident\nMr McMahon, the matter is being dealt with, and the Commission will decide which Commissioner is to answer your question. That will certainly be discussed, and the Commission is free to decide which of the Commissioners will answer it.\n\nMcMahon\nMadam President, I was well aware who the Commissioner would be: I tabled the question on transport to Commissioner Kinnock, who is the Transport Commissioner. Now someone in this institution - or in one of the two institutions - decided not to refer it to Commissioner Kinnock. I want to know whether the failure is in Parliament's or the Commission's services, and I want to know whether it is a simple administrative blunder or a political manoeuvre! Only the President can find that out!\n\nPresident\nNo, Mr McMahon, it is neither of those things. I can only repeat what I have just said. The questions are submitted to the Commission as a collegial body, and the Commission itself then decides who will answer a particular question. In other words, neither we nor you can decide in this case that Mr Kinnock will answer your question. We shall pass the matter on, and then the question will be answered.\n\nGuti\u00e9rrez D\u00edaz\nMadam President, if I may, I would like to make two small comments on the Minutes.\n", "Statements by the President\nPresident\nI have several things to say at the beginning of the session. In opening this plenary session of the European Parliament, once again I have to inform you of several tragic natural disasters which have occurred in recent days. Today, there was an earthquake in Turkey in which at least 57 people died. Last week, there was also an earthquake in Chile, which claimed nearly 300 victims, and storms raging across Europe caused the deaths of over 60 people, most of whom were citizens of France. Furthermore, we should not forget Haiti, where the latest toll of victims of the earthquake in January is now in excess of 300 000 people. In all these cases, I have sent condolences and expressions of sympathy, on behalf of the European Parliament, to the victims' families. Every unexpected and premature death is, more than anything, a tragedy for the families concerned, but when victims are numbered in tens or hundreds of thousands, it is also a tragedy for entire nations and the whole world. Let us join in solidarity with the families and also send expressions of solidarity to the countries which have been hit by such a tragedy.\nThursday, 11 March marks the 20th anniversary of the restoration of Lithuanian independence. Lithuania was the first country of the Soviet bloc to declare independence from the USSR. Among the Lithuanian Members of the European Parliament, there are four signatories of the declaration of independence of 1990. Congratulations to our fellow Members from Lithuania.\n(Applause)\nAlso, on 11 March 1990, the Congress of Estonia, a democratic, provisional parliament, adopted a declaration of reestablishment of the state after 50 years of Soviet occupation. We also congratulate our fellow Members from Estonia.\n(Applause)\nWednesday, 10 March marks the 51st anniversary of the popular uprising in Tibet. As a result of the uprising, the Dalai Lama and 80 000 Tibetans had to leave their country. We continue to hope, and we regularly ", "Securities settlement systems and financial collateral arrangements (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Kauppi, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 98/26/EC on settlement finality in payment and securities settlement systems and Directive 2002/47/EC on financial collateral arrangements as regards linked systems and credit claims - C6-0181/2008 -.\nPiia-Noora Kauppi\nrapporteur. - Mr President, I have had the pleasure of being the rapporteur on this topic of settlement finality in payment and securities settlement systems and the directive on financial collateral arrangements. I am leaving Parliament tomorrow - this will be my last legislative report for the European Parliament - so please accept my sincere apologies if I am a little bit emotional tonight.\nThis is not the most political of items. Sometimes what we do in the European Parliament is quite technical, but I am absolutely sure that this directive, this legislation, will also help Europe to go forward.\nThe aim of this legislation is to update the directives in line with the latest market and regulatory developments. The main change brought about by the settlement finality directive is to extend the protection of the directive to cover night-time settlement and settlement between linked systems; this is very important, since the number of links and the need for interoperability have lately increased immensely. The MIFID directive, on which I also had the honour to be rapporteur in this House, and the European code of conduct on clearing and settlement systems are expected to become increasingly operable, and that means that we have more need to coordinate our settlement and financial collateral arrangements.\nRegarding the Financial Collateral Directive (FCD), it is very important to accept credit claims as financial collateral. The European Parliament also wanted to exten", "Succession and wills (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, with recommendations to the Commission on succession and wills (2005/2148 (INI)).\nGiuseppe Gargani \nrapporteur. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me say straight away that, in relation to the measure before us, there are in the European Union between 50 000 and 100 000 cases of succession due to death, and this is a measure that is likely to become the reference in issues of international law.\nTransnational succession is an extremely wide-ranging phenomenon, and it comes up against an increasing number of difficulties stemming from profound differences between the system of private international law and the substantive law systems of the Member States. That often results in obstacles to the freedom of movement and the enjoyment of the right to own property. The Committee on Legal Affairs, which I have the honour of chairing, has therefore decided to take the initiative to make successions in Europe simpler by using the power granted to it by Article 192 of the EC Treaty, and to call on the Commission to adopt a legislative proposal.\nSince we, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately do not yet have the power to initiate legislation like all our counterparts in the national parliaments - that is an observation that I always make - I turn to you, Commissioner Frattini, and, with the strong backing that I am sure the qualified majority vote will give me, I call on you to carry forward an important request of ours in the interests of Europe's citizens.\nYou are aware that, for beneficiaries to take possession of an estate, they currently have to start proceedings in all the countries where the property is located. This is not only a costly and laborious process, but, since the transmission of property by inheritance is a special way of transferring ownership, it is associated with emotional and personal aspects - highly complex inter", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nOomen-Ruijten\nMadam President, during the sitting yesterday adjournment of a debate was requested under Rule 131. The debate covered asylum rights and the adjournment was requested by Mr Schulz. It can happen, of course, that adjournment has to be requested, but we have a feeling that the Socialist Group plays these kind of tricks every time. We saw it last week at the part-session in Strasbourg during the debate on drugs policy which was adjourned on the same grounds, and yesterday we had to witness this trick with regard to asylum policy.\nWe are under the impression that the Socialist Group does this when they cannot win a debate. It was clear that on drugs policy they were going to lose gloriously in the House. It was clear that on asylum policy the opinion of the Socialist Group was not going to be shared by the majority of the House. Mr Nassauer made that clear more than once to the Socialist Group. Using Rule 131 to spring surprises on Parliament does not fit in with the mores of the House. I have become familiar with the excuses of the Socialist Group, but I do think that on this point we have to make agreements in advance. It is not acceptable to spring surprises on one another.\n\nPresident\nMrs Oomen-Ruijten, I let you speak for longer than your allotted speaking time, but I would like to ask the other members who have asked for the floor to keep to their speaking time. I assume that you wish to speak on the same subject, Mrs Fontaine.\n\nFontaine\nMadam President, I would like to address the same subject, that is, referral to committee of the asylum rights issues which were decided upon yesterday afternoon. Of course, I am not contesting the request for referral which is entirely in accordance with the rules, but rather the conditions under which the vote was taken. Only 51 Members were able to take part in the vote, and I feel, Madam President, ", "European order for payment procedure (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the Council common position (07535/3/2006 C6-0227/2006 for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council creating a European order for payment procedure (Rapporteur: Arlene McCarthy).\nArlene McCarthy \nrapporteur. - Mr President, Commissioner, almost 12 months ago we first gave our approval to the European payment order, a new law to assist in simplified debt recovery for businesses and citizens owed money in another EU Member State. Today, a year later, the committee's view has not changed. We believe that we need this pragmatic and practical EU law, in particular to ensure that businesses and citizens have an affordable system to recover those debts owed to them. Why? Because until this law comes into force, recovery of debts from another EU State is a costly legal process. In some cases, money spent on lawyers and administrative costs exceeds the amount owed to the individual. More significantly, studies and experience show that companies which do not get their debts paid are at risk of collapsing, with knock-on effects not just in terms of job losses, but also for other SMEs in the supply chain.\nOut of between 30 and 40 billion invoices in Europe each year, as many as 1 billion default and turn into debt cases. Interim Justicia carried out a survey on payment practices in 16 European countries some 10 years ago. The average delay then was just 14 days. By the end of 2003, however, this had not declined, but risen to 16 days. According to a World Bank study, 'Doing Business in 2004: Understanding Regulation', the Nordic countries have the most efficient and effective legal systems of the countries surveyed. They take the least time to reach a solution while keeping costs low. Italy is one of the countries with the longest delays worldwide. The explanation it is said lies in the lax ap", "27. EU-Turkey relations (vote) \n- Motions for a resolution,\n- Before the vote on paragraph 19:\nRia Oomen-Ruijten\nMr President, I have an oral amendment but it is in the text. My oral amendment is: 'and to promote the application of EU environmental standards to large-scale mining and water barrage projects'.\n(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)\n", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nLaima Liucija Andrikien\n(LT) Mr President, I voted for this resolution on the ongoing negotiations on the 2011 budget. The failure of last week's Parliament-Council Conciliation Committee meeting has caused significant concern throughout the European Union. It is regrettable that some do not yet feel they need to adhere to the Treaty of Lisbon. If we are unable to agree on the budget and other related issues by the end of the year, there will be very grave consequences. The creation of the European External Action Service and the three new institutions to monitor European Union financial institutions would be very difficult if there is a lack of funding. A shortage of money would also mean that cohesion policy, one of the most important policies in the European Union, would not be implemented properly, not to mention what would happen to the Europe 2020 strategy and the GALILEO programme. I therefore feel that the constructive and flexible position of the European Parliament demonstrates once again that, faced with the conditions of the financial crisis, the European Parliament really is acting responsibly.\nPeter Jahr\n(DE) Mr President, with regard to the disaster of the budget negotiations for 2011, I would like to say: firstly, the right to draw up a budget is a central right of any democratic parliament. Secondly, a parliament that takes itself seriously must exercise this right. Thirdly, I would like to call on the European Council to respect and accept this self-evident right of the European Parliament. Fourthly, a process must be found to ensure that the voice of the European Parliament is heard when it comes to budgetary decisions.\nHannu Takkula\n(FI) Mr President, I voted in favour of this budget and it is, of course, clear that if we in Parliament have budgetary power, we should exercise it.\nNow, however, we need to think about how we can act responsibly. I might say that, in many respects, the budget's content ", "Immediate EU measures in support of Italy and other Member States affected by exceptional migratory flows (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the immediate EU measures in support of Italy and other Member States affected by exceptional migratory flows.\nCecilia Malmstr\u00f6m\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you for this very timely debate on a situation that deserves all our attention.\nThe Commission is following the situation very closely and Frontex has sent two experts to the scene. Approximately 5 500 Tunisian migrants are reported to have reached Italian shores in the last couple of days, but the numbers have dropped a little bit in the last 24 hours. Those arriving are mostly men in their thirties, but there are also 34 women and 108 children; 27 facilitators of trafficking were identified. These people arriving on Italian shores are causing exceptional pressure on the reception facilities of Italy, particularly in Lampedusa.\nLast Saturday, we already started to have contact with the Italian Ministry of the Interior and we have also received a formal request for EU assistance. We are ready to assist both Italy and Tunisia. This is a matter of importance for the whole EU, not just a bilateral issue. Even before the last developments, the Commission, together with Frontex, started to identify what can be done in the short and medium term. The EU common response should be based on the principle of EU solidarity between Member States; and we are ready to assist Italy.\nBut our approach should also be based on solidarity with Tunisia and its democratic transition. This was also expressed by Lady Ashton when she visited the Tunisian authorities in Tunis yesterday, offering them political and financial support.\nTo assist Italy in these circumstances, we have identified a comprehensive series of concrete measures as well as quick financial assistance. Financially, we are ready to mobilise extraordinary assistance, under the European Refugee Fun", "23. EU counter-terrorism policy: main achievements and future challenges (\n- Before the vote:\nSophia in 't Veld\nrapporteur. - Mr President, with reference to Rule 177 of the Rules of Procedure, I would like to propose to the House that we postpone the vote on the evaluation of EU counter-terrorism policies. Although the report was adopted by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs in July, it would seem that positions have been shifting in recent days and controversy has arisen over a number of issues. That is very unfortunate considering that the issue is very sensitive.\nAs rapporteur, I worked on a timetable which would have allowed for a plenary vote before the summer break, but the timetable has been slipping. However, what counts in the end is the result; evaluation is a key element of transparency and accountability, and it is important that Parliament has a clear and consensual view of what evaluation should include. I believe that with a little more time we may find circumstances more favourable to a common approach and be able to present a result that will command widespread support. I therefore ask the House to support postponement.\nSimon Busuttil\non behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, on behalf of the EPP Group, I wish to speak against this request for a postponement. I wish to remind colleagues that we have already agreed to postpone the vote at the committee stage and this honestly did not get us any closer to a good, reasonable compromise text that we could all agree upon. In fact, it did not get us anywhere. So a postponement at this stage is not likely to help in any way.\nAlso, I hope that this request is not motivated by the national electoral interests of those who might wish to vote one way today and another way after their election.\nHannes Swoboda\non behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, I can only agree with Mr Busuttil. I hope those opposing postponement are not motivated by national election considerations. We suppor", "\n\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is the report (A6-0216/2006) by Mr\u00a0Ransdorf on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on nanoscience and nanotechnologies: An action plan for Europe 2005-2009 [2006/2004(INI)]. \nMiloslav Ransdorf (GUE/NGL ),\n\u00a0\u00a0 . \u2013 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I take the floor on the issue of nanotechnology with some trepidation, because we have seen that the original plans in this area, from the point of view of the budget, have not been fulfilled. We have seen expenditure cut by 38%, and, even though in the last framework plan there was a substantial increase from EUR\u00a0140\u00a0million per year to EUR\u00a0600\u00a0million, this figure still falls short of what we would have wanted, especially given the EU\u2019s dynamism in this area. We are still in a great position in the area of fundamental research and publication \u2013 the EU is ahead of the United States in the field. As regards patents, however, the United States\u2019 worldwide share is 42%, whereas the EU stands at 36%. We have also seen that when it comes to getting products onto the market, the EU works more slowly. US federal expenditure is approximately equivalent to that of the whole of the EU in the area of nanotechnologies and nanosciences, and the individual Member States have unequal spending levels. In fact, only Ireland spends more per head of the population than the United States.\nI wish to stress the fact that opinion polls carried out in 2001, based on a sample of 16\u00a0000 people, showed that very few people in the EU are informed about nanotechnologies. In this regard, I should like to quote two great scholars. The first is Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. In Faust, Mephisto says: \u2018Despise reason and science, and you are mine, all mine\u2019. I do not wish to take the same position as Mephisto, but, in any event, I should warn against cutting spending in this area in comparison with other countries. The other great scholar I wish to quote \u2013 and I hope this makes him happy, even though he is n", "Multiannual Financial Framework (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by the President of the Commission on the multiannual financial framework.\nThis is one of the most important subjects we will deal with over the next few years, and it is an important subject for the future of the European Union. This is why we attach so much importance to this debate, and we are also grateful to the European Commission, and to the outgoing Hungarian Presidency, for including the European Parliament in the debate. We would like to thank President Barroso and the Commissioner for presenting proposals to us before they were presented to the press and the media, which they did on Wednesday evening, as we will all remember.\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso\nPresident of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last Wednesday, the Commission adopted its proposals for the next multiannual financial framework, and I have the honour to present it, together with Mr Lewandowski, immediately at the Conference of Presidents.\nWhile drafting these proposals, we benefited greatly from the high quality of your contributions, especially the excellent SURE report, for which I would like to thank you.\nThe European budget we are proposing for the 2014-2020 period is both ambitious and innovative, responsible and rigorous.\nIt is a budget which, in the current economic context, provides reasonable funding for our European policies, with increased funding for sectors of the future.\nIt is a budget which will cost the taxpayer no more than the current budget but which may make a huge difference for 500 million Europeans. How can we achieve this?\nFirst of all by focusing our spending on funding priorities that will enable us to work together to achieve our shared objectives, those of the Europe 2020 strategy. That is why the budget we are proposing is largely devoted to growth and employment. While it is true that, even today, in some of our countries there are quite demanding programmes, ", "EUROMED (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on preparations for the Euromed Ministerial Conference on Migration.\nBefore handing over to the Council and then the Commission I would ask Members to adhere strictly to their speaking time, for the small leeway that we had has now been used up. It is true that the previous debate was an important one. In theory, if everyone observes their speaking time we shall be fine.\nJos\u00e9 Magalh\u00e3es\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the first Euromed Ministerial Conference on Migration will be held in Santa Eul\u00e1lia, in the Algarve, Portugal, between 18 and 19 November. Said like this, it seems the most banal of statements, but it is not. We have managed to organise this high-level ministerial conference after this was defined as a priority by our Heads of State and Government in November 2005. That was nearly two years ago, on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the Barcelona Process Summit, when the growing importance of migration issues within our Euro-Mediterranean Partnership was recognised. Subsequently, as some of you will certainly remember, we had occasion in Rabat, Tripoli to reaffirm our common political agenda.\nWe did this realistically and lucidly, in the Council's opinion. There are now, on both sides of the Mediterranean region, sizeable migrant communities which play a very important role in our societies. We have a duty to give new impetus to the Partnership which can take advantage of the existence of these vigorous communities. The complexity and significance of migration issues mean that everyone needs to tackle these, both countries of origin and countries of transit and destination. At this first conference in the Algarve, the Council feels that the debate should be focused on the most pressing issues and only on these, with a step-by-step approach to these issues.\nThe main items on", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament, adjourned on Friday, 30 September 1996.\n\nApproval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of the last sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nPlooij-Van Gorsel\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, you may remember that during the last sitting in Strasbourg, I asked why the Dutch station RTL4 had disappeared from our screens here. Two weeks ago, I received a call from Parliament to tell me that it would be available again in time for this sitting. So I came to Strasbourg full of anticipation and turned my set on this afternoon, only to find that this was not the case. Channel 12 now has a teleshopping programme selling German goods, which is not the same thing at all. So I would ask you, Mr President, to do what you can to ensure that we do get RTL4 back as we were promised.\nMy second question concerns written questions. On 9 September, I tabled a question under Rule 42, which means that I should have received a reply within three weeks, or six if it was a difficult problem. It is now precisely six weeks since 9 September and I have still not received an answer. To whom should I apply for an answer to my question?\n\nPresident\nWe shall look into your first point, Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel. As regards the second matter, you will know that I am the one who has been trying to ensure that deadlines are respected in all cases, especially as regards the questions tabled by Members. If that has not worked in this case, I shall do all I can to ensure that you receive a reply very quickly.\n(Parliament approved the Minutes)\n\nOrder of business\nPresident\nThe next item is the order of business.\nThe final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 17 October 1996 pursuant to Rule 95 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.\nWednesday:\n\nPresident\nThe Group of the European Radical Alliance has requested the referral back to committe", "5. Situation in Gaza (vote) \n- Before the vote\nJos\u00e9 Ignacio Salafranca S\u00e1nchez-Neyra\n(ES) - Mr President, following consultation with the political groups signing the joint resolution, we wish to request a change in the structure of paragraph 3.\nThis is not an oral amendment, for we do not wish to add or remove any words. We merely wish to maintain the text as it is, dividing it up into three separate paragraphs.\nTo remove any doubt, Mr President, it would read as follows:\n'3. Reiterates its call for an immediate end to all acts of violence;'\n'4. Calls on Israel to cease military actions killing and endangering civilians, and extrajudicial targeted killings;'\n'5. Calls on Hamas, following the illegal takeover of the Gaza Strip, to prevent the firing of rockets by Palestinian militias from the Gaza Strip into Israeli territory;'.\nThus there is no change in the wording, Mr President. We are not asking for any words to be added or removed: only that this paragraph be divided into those three sections.\n(Parliament approved the proposal)\n", "9. The economic partnership agreements (vote) \n- Report: Sturdy\n- Before the vote on Amendment 23:\nMargrietus van den Berg\n(NL) Mr President, the last sentence of Amendment 23 now reads 'calls on the EU to set up the compensation mechanisms required to avert consequences of this sort'. This has met with opposition, for it seems to imply that we, the EU, should carry all financial consequences. In order to avoid this misinterpretation, I would suggest an oral amendment according to which it would read 'calls on the EU to help to set up the compensation mechanisms required to avert consequences of this sort'.\n(The oral amendment was accepted)\n", "EU recognition of the Roma genocide during World War II\nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by the President concerning the EU's recognition of the Roma genocide during World War II.\nToday the Roma are the largest ethnic minority in the European Union. They are also the most oppressed community in Europe at present. During World War II they were persecuted on grounds of race by the Nazis, in the same way as Jews. Hundreds of thousands of Roma, whose ancestors had been European citizens for generations, were slaughtered. The 66th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, which we commemorated on 27 January this year, serves as a reminder to us that the Roma were the third largest group among the victims of this camp. Unfortunately, not all Europeans are aware of this fact. Only a few EU Member States have officially recognised the Roma genocide. It is time to make European citizens aware of the fact that the Roma living among us experienced the trauma of genocide as a community. Education is the best way to fight discrimination. The European Parliament acts as the EU's voice in the fight for human rights. Today we are speaking up for our Roma brothers and sisters. We would like their suffering to be remembered and their situation to be better understood.\nColleagues, there will now be a very short discussion on this topic so please do not leave the Chamber. First we will have a statement from the Council and, as you know, Roma integration is one of the priorities of the Hungarian Presidency. This will be followed by a statement from the Vice-President of the Commission and then short statements on behalf of the political groups.\nEnik\u0151 Gy\u0151ri\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to begin by quoting the words of Porajmos survivor Friderika Kolomp\u00e1r: 'We found my father when we went to Auschwitz on 2 August of '94 or '95. Their names were arrayed on a large plaque. We knew that they had been taken t", "10. Integrated Maritime Policy (\nSa\u00efd El Khadraoui\n(NL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I concur with the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs that in order to underline the need for a worldwide agreement on environmental measures within the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a minor amendment of the text is needed. Specifically, reference is made to the outcome of the 61st session of the IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee a few weeks ago. The following words, which I will quote in English, should be added immediately after this: 'and maintaining its call for further substantial progress within the IMO'.\nPresident\nAre there any objections? It seems not to be the case so we will proceed with the vote on Amendment 1 by roll-call vote.\n", "Future of European standardisation (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Edvard Ko\u017eu\u0161n\u00edk, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the future of European standardisation.\nEdvard Ko\u017eu\u0161n\u00edk\nThe report that we are dealing with today is submitted as a precursor to a standardisation package which the Commission is currently working on. This should provide a legislative revision of the existing legal framework of European standardisation, which we will use to define the development of standardisation in the coming decades. It is therefore in the interest of Parliament to use this report to convey to the Commission and relevant specialists our concept of the future development of European standardisation.\nThe form of the system of European standardisation is key to fully exploiting the potential of the internal market, improving the competitiveness of the European economy and fulfilling the Europe 2020 strategy. We have therefore given our full attention to this subject in the Committee on the Internal Market. We have conducted intensive discussions with all stakeholders, both at international and European level and at the level of organisations in the individual Member States. When seeking the best form of European standardisation, we did our best by representatives of small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as consumer representatives, disabled people, environmentalists and other organisations representing community interests.\nDuring discussions on the future form of European standardisation, we concluded that the design review should be based on the strengths of the existing system, which provides a stable base on which to build. We cannot undertake any radical changes that could weaken the key merits of the current system. In order to achieve an effectively functioning system of European standardisation, it is necessary for national standardisation organisations that play a less active role in the existin", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nChristopher Heaton-Harris\nMadam President, I abstained on this particular issue because I think the Commission has got too much to do and it does not really need to reassess where it is going politically or policy-wise. It should be talking much more about deregulation, not about how we can go forward with a common immigration policy.\nMany small businesses in the region that I represent would like to see less regulation coming from this place. Actually many people would like to see the regulation that comes from this place better implemented across the whole of the European Union.\nFinally, there are many in my region who express concern that the Commission does not do what it is meant to do. For example, the Commission might at this present point in time be shelving infringement cases against various Member States, when it comes to gambling, to hide this away from the general public for a couple of years. That is something the Commission should be getting on with now.\nBernard Wojciechowski\n(PL) Madam President, the Commission's priorities for 2009 are increased employment, climate change and a sustainable Europe. Employment in the European Union is especially deserving of attention.\nThe Amsterdam Treaty was adopted in November 1997 during the Luxembourg summit. This created the basis for the formation of a European employment strategy. Due to the problem of unemployment in the Member States, where 17 million people were out of work at that time, this issue was made a priority. Nine years later, in 2006, in the enlarged European Union, 64.3% of people of working age were in employment. Denmark had the highest level of employment, Poland the lowest. A total of 7.9% of people of working age were unemployed. As a comparison, unemployment in the United States was 4.6%. Over the last year, 24 of the Member States recorded a drop in unemployment and three reported an increase. The largest decreases were seen in Poland, Bulgari", "Amendment of Regulation (EC) No 663/2009 establishing a programme to aid economic recovery by granting Community financial assistance to projects in the field of energy (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Van Brempt, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 663/2009 establishing a programme to aid economic recovery by granting Community financial assistance to projects in the field of energy - C7-0139/2010 -.\nKathleen Van Brempt\nMadam President, ladies and gentlemen, you see before you a very happy rapporteur, because I think that we - and I very much emphasise the we - have produced a report that will hopefully soon be adopted almost unanimously, as all political groups in Parliament have worked intensively on it and in close cooperation.\nThe report and the regulations it addresses have a lengthy history in this House. It had its origins, specifically, in the recovery plan launched in 2009 in the wake of the economic crisis. At the time, EUR 4 billion was freed up at European level, and these funds were earmarked specifically for economic recovery. The objective was that that money should also finance energy projects in particular: large-scale energy projects, devoted to carbon capture and storage, to infrastructure, and to a number of large offshore wind energy projects.\nAt that time, Parliament having of course approved these projects, there were quite a few objections from various quarters and from Parliament itself, especially vis-\u00e0-vis the large-scale nature of the undertaking and the question of whether this or that project would create enough jobs. However, the most important criticism regarded energy efficiency. This was followed by a political agreement and the current situation is the result of that agreement.\nYou would think that if Parliament, the Council and the Commission reach a political agreement about in", "One-minute speeches (Rule 150) \nPresident\nThe next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.\nJim Higgins\n(GA) Madam President, it must be the aim of the European Union to greatly reduce the incidence of fatalities and serious injuries and to improve road safety.\nI do not accept the need to wait until 2033 for the European Driving Licence to be put into effect. At present, there is just a European model for the driving licence but what is meant by that, really?\nWe want to protect road users, if there is the political will to do so, and I firmly believe that modern technology now available can shorten the period for putting Directive 2006/126/EC into effect. We cannot wait any longer - that is extremely important. The Commission must do something concrete about this.\nAlajos M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros\n(HU) Madam President, democracy, freedom, solidarity and Christian ideals are the common European values that I believe in. These were also avowed by Count J\u00e1nos Eszterh\u00e1zy, a Slovakian Hungarian politician, who was condemned on trumped up charges by the Communists in 1947 and died a martyr's death in M\u00edrov prison in 1957. Apart from his countless other merits, he was the only politician who, as a Member of Parliament, condemned and voted against the deportation of the Jews in the Parliament of the fascist Slovakian state in 1942. His only crime was to stand up without fail for the Hungarians of Slovakia who, together with the German-speaking citizens, were vilified en masse, and made stateless and displaced under the shameful Bene\u0161 decrees. The EU should be ashamed that these inhumane decrees legitimising state terror are still in force, and the rehabilitation of J\u00e1nos Eszterh\u00e1zy, as well as hundreds of thousands of citizens deprived of their human dignity, is still awaited. I call on my honourable fellow Members to have deeper concern about protecting our common European values.\nGeorge Sabin Cuta\u015f\n(RO) Madam President, this year, the separatist demonstrations or", "Electronic communications networks, personal data and the protection of privacy - Electronic communications networks and services - Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) and the Office - Frequency bands for mobile communications (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on:\nthe recommendation for second reading by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2002/22/EC on universal service and users' rights relating to electronic communications networks, Directive 2002/58/EC concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws (16497/1/2008 - C6-0068/2009 - (Rapporteur: Mr Harbour),\nthe recommendation for second reading by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directives 2002/21/EC on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services, 2002/19/EC on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and associated facilities, and 2002/20/EC on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services (16496/1/2008 - C6-0066/2009 - (Rapporteur: Mrs Trautmann),\nthe recommendation for second reading by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on the Council common position for adopting a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European Electronic Communications Market Authority (16498/1/2008 - C6-0067/2009 - (Rapporteur: Mrs del Castillo Vera), and\nthe report by Mrs Pleguezuelos Aguilar, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a directive of the", "External dimension of social policy (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Falbr, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the external dimension of social policy, promoting labour and social standards and European corporate social responsibility.\nRichard Falbr\nMr President, as I said in my speech a short while ago, the external dimension of social policy covers EU measures and initiatives aimed at promoting employment standards and social standards in third countries. Although the Lisbon strategy and the Europe 2020 initiative place a far greater emphasis on social policy than was ever the case before, competitiveness and economic factors are still the centre of attention. I therefore took a very critical approach to the drafting of this report. If we want the third countries with whom we negotiate agreements to respect the principles and the very basis of the European social model, we must respect this model within the European Union. If we want the countries with which we negotiate international agreements to respect the International Labour Organisation's fundamental conventions, then we must respect them ourselves. It is plain to see, however, that ILO conventions are violated in some Member States.\nAs far as corporate social responsibility is concerned, it is undoubtedly a good idea, and has been under discussion since the early 1970s. The problem is, however, that it cannot be enforced. When we were debating the comments on this report and amendments to it, one of the views expressed was that a directive should be drafted, since some businesses simply do not behave in a socially responsible way. More than 150 amendments were tabled to the report, but I think that it nevertheless still takes a critical approach. The European Union needs to do more to support the International Labour Organisation, since it is absurd that, while we profess support, fewer and fewer countries are ratifying and respecting the conven", "Disturbing situation regarding waste in the Campania region (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by the Commission on the disturbing situation regarding waste in the Campania region.\nStavros Dimas\nMember of the Commission. - (EL) Mr President, honourable members of the European Parliament, the refuse which has been accumulating in the streets of Naples and neighbouring towns since 21 December, as the media inform us, is estimated to have exceeded the huge quantity of 100,000 tonnes. This, in combination with the negative - I would say catastrophic - effects for residents and the environment, is a cause for grave concern.\nThe crisis in recent days in Naples did not come from nowhere. It is the culmination of deficient enforcement of European legislation on refuse over the past 14 years, for which Italy has been repeatedly condemned by the Court of the European Communities.\nBeyond the role of organised crime which is emphasised by the press, a direct cause of the present crisis appears to be inaction and lack of will to adopt the measures necessary for solving the chronic problem of waste management.\nWhen the Commission was first informed of the crisis in the refuse collection and disposal system in Campania, in the spring of 2007, proceedings were initiated against Italy for contravention of Community legislation on refuse. Since then, the Commission has been observing developments at first hand and has already come to an initial on-the-spot assessment of the situation, at the request of the Italian government. A further meeting with the competent Italian authorities is due to take place in the next few days. It is the responsibility of the Italian authorities to take immediate measures to clear the refuse from the streets. But as this new crisis shows, it is not enough merely to remove the refuse from the streets. Any short-term measures must be supplemented by the adoption and, most important, the effective implementation of long-term strategic measur", "15. Animal by-products (\n- Before the vote\nHorst Schnellhardt\nMadam President, I would just like to make two brief comments. The translation may give rise to confusion in the different languages. I would therefore like to state for the record that the amendment made to Article 2(2)(a) with the wording 'except wild game' must always be considered in conjunction with point aa. This will remove the confusion.\nPresident\nI can assure you that all of the linguistic versions will be checked in this respect, Mr Schnellhardt.\n", "7. Social economy (\n- Before the vote:\nPatrizia Toia\nrapporteur. - (IT) Madam President, I propose that in paragraph 12 the words 'the components of the' be added before the words 'social economy', and the words 'as a third sector' be deleted, as written in the list here.\n", "Opening of the sitting\n(The sitting was opened at 10.05 a.m.)\nPresident. In accordance with the Act relating to the election of the Members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage, I declare the session open.\nThis is the second time that, quite undeservedly, I have had the honour of presiding over the election of the President of the European Parliament. It will, of course, be the President who delivers a keynote speech. The applause with which we welcomed the new Member States (Bulgaria and Romania) yesterday and the warm tribute paid to Mr Borrell are signs of trust and continuity. In a few weeks' time, it will be the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, which marks the birth of the European family, a newcomer to the international political and economic scene. We will proudly celebrate it:\nbecause of the extraordinary 60 years of practically uninterrupted peace on our continent;\nbecause of our shared values: freedom, democracy and social justice; and\nbecause of the hopes that political Europe has inspired in many parts of the world.\nIt is only by looking ahead that we can respond to these expectations, to the demands and also to the criticisms of Europeans on institutional and social issues. I am referring to a globalised world, to the progress it has made and to the ever-growing injustice within it. I am referring to the great responsibility that we have towards the future of energy and the environment, that is to say, towards the survival of the planet and towards future generations. I am referring to new opportunities linked to developments in science, to the way in which the applications of these developments are managed, and to the advantages and ethical dilemmas that arise in everyone's minds and that mean making informed decisions.\n", "\n\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is the Council Statement on the presentation of the programme of the Finnish Presidency.\nWe welcome the Prime Minister of Finland and his Secretary of State for European Affairs, as well as the President of the Commission.\nMr Vanhanen has the floor first, on behalf of the Council. \nMatti Vanhanen,\n\u00a0\u00a0 . Mr President, Mr\u00a0President and Madam\u00a0Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, honourable guests, I warmly thank you for this opportunity to come and discuss the priorities and main objectives of the Finnish Presidency with the European Parliament. It is an exacting task to discharge the responsibilities of the Presidency in the European Union, but at the same time it is a great honour and privilege, and Finland welcomes the challenge.\nAs the country to hold the Presidency, our collaboration with the European Parliament has got off to a good start. I would like to thank the President and all the other Members of the European Parliament who attended the meeting between the Finnish Government and Parliament in Helsinki. Furthermore, several parliamentary committees and political groups have visited Finland and engaged in productive discussions regarding the aims of our Presidency.\nEver since Finland joined the EU it has supported efforts to make the work of the Union\u2019s institutions more effective and improve the close cooperation that exists between them. As the country to hold the Presidency, we will work in close and effective cooperation with the European Parliament. By that I do not just refer to Parliament\u2019s role in the codecision procedure as a legislator on an equal footing with the Council, but in a wider context, promoting the key aims of the Union.\nFinland\u2019s own national parliament, the , is celebrating a special anniversary. This year it is 100 years since the unicameral parliament was founded and universal suffrage established. Everyone, men and women alike, at the same time had the right to vote and the right to s", "\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 16 September (1). \n\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is the speeches on matters of political importance. \nMcCarthy (PSE ).\n\u00a0\u00a0  Mr President, I wish to thank you personally for your efforts and assistance in trying to secure the release of my constituent from Liverpool, Ken Bigley, who was taken hostage in Iraq. On Friday we received the very tragic news that he had been executed. I should be grateful, Mr President, if you would send our sympathy and condolences to his family on behalf of the Members of this Parliament. This request is also being made on behalf of the other Members of the European Parliamentary Labour Party.\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you very much, Mrs McCarthy. I must tell you that that letter has been sent, and that I have previously sent my condolences to the family and to the British people. The letter of condolence that I have sent to the Bigley family says that we all feel affected by this brutal murder. We had previously called on the kidnappers to free Mr Bigley, but that call \u2013 like so many from every part of the world \u2013 was in vain. Now all we can do is mourn his death and express our condolences to his family. So, that letter has been sent. I thank you for suggesting we should do so. \nDe Rossa (PSE ).\n\u00a0\u00a0  Mr President, I rise on the issue of human rights abuses in Colombia. I have been approached by the FrontLine organisation, which is an international foundation for the protection of human rights defenders. It concentrates on defending human rights defenders who engage in peaceful actions in relation to human rights in their country.\nIn February this year a number of trade unionists \u2013 members of a peasant farmers' association \u2013 were arrested. They have not yet been charged and there is no evidence of any possible serious charges against them. Up to 30 trade unionists have been assassinated in Colombia this year alone. It is a situation which the European Un", "14. Deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms (implementing powers conferred on the Commission) (vote) \n- Report: Gyula Hegyi\n- Before the vote:\nGyula Hegyi  \nrapporteur. - Mr President, I do not want to steal my colleagues' time, but as we did not have a plenary debate and we have reached the first reading discussion, I would like to inform you about the basic elements of the new legislation on GMOs.\nThe compromise package gives Parliament the right to control the deliberate release of GMOs. Parliamentary control means transparency on this sensitive issue. The Eurobarometer opinion poll showed that, with regard to GMOs, 94% of our citizens want the right to choose, 86% want to know more before consuming GMOs and 71% simply do not want GMO food. That is why our greatest success is that the Council and the Commission have agreed to Parliamentary control of the implementation of the labelling requirements of GMOs.\nI wish to thank the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency. Having greater openness on genetically modified organisms makes Europe more democratic.\n", "Approval of Minutes of previous sitting\nPresident\nThe Minutes of the sitting of Thursday 30 November 2006 have been distributed.\nAre there are any comments?\nMargrietus van den Berg\n(NL) Mr President, as you will remember and as is also evident from the Minutes, we held the debate on World AIDS Day and Europe's measures in this field on Thursday, which featured the issue of the Global Health Fund and funding. In the debate with the Commission, it became apparent that Parliament was extremely anxious about the lack of funding; the reason why it quizzed the Commission about the development instrument - which will be the subject of tomorrow's debate - was that this instrument was at risk of being looted in favour of the Global Health Fund, with the risk of the same mistake being made twice.\nI can inform you that we in the Committee on Development received a letter from the Commission on 3 December in which it still pledges to get the funds for the Global Health Fund from the European Development Fund and to leave the programming of the thematic section of the development instrument alone. We will continue this debate tomorrow, but it is good to make a mental note of this.\nPresident\nI am sorry, Mr Van den Berg, but I do not understand how what you have said relates to the Minutes of the sitting.\nAre you suggesting any amendment of the Minutes?\nMargrietus van den Berg\n(NL) No, Mr President, I have no comments regarding the content of the Minutes.\nPresident\nYou have indulged in a little parliamentary filibustering, but what is done is done, there is nothing we can do about it now. It will be recorded in the Minutes, of course.\n(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved)\n", "Restructuring of the sugar industry - Common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on\nthe report by Katerina Batzeli, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the restructuring of the sugar industry - C6-0176/2007 -, and\nthe report by Katerina Batzeli, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector - C6-0177/2007 -.\nMariann Fischer Boel\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, let me start by thanking Ms Batzeli and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for all the work they have carried out on this proposal. I will now start to place the proposal into its context.\nAs you know, the restructuring fund did not fulfil our expectations during the second year of the restructuring period, after actually quite a promising first year.\nAs you might remember, we were expecting about 1.5 million tonnes of quota to be renounced in the first year and more than 3 million tonnes in the second year. In reality, the total renunciation in the first two years amounted to only 2.2 million tonnes against an expected 4.5 million tonnes.\nI am still convinced that the restructuring fund is a good instrument as such, which should be strengthened and improved, taking into account the experiences that we have had up to now.\nConcerning the proposal we are to discuss today, let me make it clear that we are not in a process of renegotiating the sugar reform from 2005. In light of the insufficient take-up under the restructuring fund over the first two years of its operation, the objective is to make a success out of it for the last two years. Otherwise the final uncompensated cut of the quotas will kick in in 2010.\nThis proposal aims to make a very attractive offer to those undertakings and to those growers that want to give up quota production in the marketing year 2008/09, while in principle keepin", "Credit requirements directives: Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC - Community programme for financial services, financial reporting and auditing\nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on:\nthe report by Mr Karas, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC as regards banks affiliated to central institutions, certain own funds items, large exposures, supervisory arrangements, and crisis management - C6-0339/2008 -, and\nthe report by Mr Hoppenstedt, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community programme to support specific activities in the field of financial services, financial reporting and auditing - C6-0031/2009 -.\nOthmar Karas\nrapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today I have the opportunity to present to you not only the findings of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs but also the results of long negotiations with the Council and the Commission. Last week we reached agreement in a trialogue on a common approach to developing a new framework for the financial markets.\nI tell you, I ask you, to look on these proposals, which we are debating today, as a complete package. Some of us wanted more, some of us wanted less, in this Parliament, in the Council and in the Commission. I can tell you that we did not agree on the smallest common denominator but attempted to agree on more than the biggest common denominator.\nWe have proposed a line for the next steps, because this can only be a first step. We have not come up with an answer to the economic and financial crisis. But we are ready to take a new step, to achieve a breakthrough in the development of a new framework for the financial markets, which will lead to the simplification of financial market regulation ", "Closure of the sitting\nPresident\nI would like to say that as tomorrow is International Women's Day, throughout the day, only women will be in the chair. Therefore, tomorrow will, without a doubt, be a very pleasant day as they usually do it far better than us.\n", "\nR\u00fcbig\nMr President, on a point of order. Questions to the Council are no longer being answered in the time stipulated. Despite being warned on two occasions, the Council has not answered European Parliament questions. Would you please ensure that the Council fulfils its obligations in this area as well?\n\nPresident\n Thank you, Mr R\u00fcbig. Your request and your comment will be dealt with appropriately.\n  \n\nLipietz\nMr President, on a point of order. Regarding the questions that will shortly be put to the Commission and the Council, you will be aware that the French Government, confronted by the fuel crisis that has gripped France along with the rest of Europe, took a number of measures yesterday which will drastically alter the conditions of competition and the basis of the fight against the greenhouse effect, and which will, therefore, have an immediate and serious impact on Europe.\nMrs Loyola de Palacio had an extremely interesting article published in the French press this morning on this European crisis. Would it be possible for her and/or the Commissioner for Competition to speak during this part-sitting in order to tell us how the Commission intends to react to the fuel crisis, and how the Commission and the Council intend to prevent an outbreak of fiscal dumping in Europe and prepare Europe to deal with this crisis?\n\nPresident\n Of course, Mr Lipietz, the point that you have raised is very topical and very urgent, but the agenda has already been fixed, and therefore, I think it will be quite difficult to satisfy your request, although the President will do everything possible to deal with it.\n\nReding\nMr President, the honourable Member's request concerns a matter of importance. The President has very clearly ruled out the possibility of a debate this morning. I shall tell Mrs de Palacio and Mr Monti that Parliament would like to hear them and, together with the Presidency, we shall decide on a suitable time.\n\nPresident\nThank you very much, Commissioner, for making", "9. Outcome of the Copenhagen Summit on climate change (\n- Before the vote:\nJo Leinen\non behalf of the S&D Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the disappointing conclusion to the climate conference in Copenhagen, Parliament is using this resolution to make it clear that there is no alternative to climate protection and that, as we move towards the next conference in Mexico, we must increase rather than decrease our efforts in this area.\nI shall be brief. Amendment 6 from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament was intended to serve this purpose. However, as it has been worded confusingly, we are withdrawing it. Nevertheless, we do support Amendments 1 and 9 from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, which call on the EU to do more en route to Mexico. Climate protection must not come to a standstill. I would ask for your support.\nRachida Dati\n(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to Amendment 21, which I have tabled, I should first like to thank all my fellow Members for having supported me in tabling an amendment which lays down the principle of establishing a carbon tax at the borders of the EU.\nI should also like to say once again that we must not use double-speak when talking to our fellow citizens: when we are campaigning, we cannot say that Europe is protecting them, that it will protect their companies and their jobs and then, once we have been elected, forget about that commitment. I should merely like to point out that this amendment has enabled me to stimulate debate, which is why I wish to withdraw it and thus allow debate to thrive in the Council.\nPresident\nThe amendment is therefore withdrawn.\nBefore the vote on Amendment 10:\nSatu Hassi\nMr President, Amendment 10 by the Greens is not in conflict with Amendment 1. Amendment 1 is about raising our ambition level to more than 20.

He died after a long hunger strike. He is the first prisoner of conscience to die in Cuba in 40 years, and we are calling here for the release of all prisoners of conscience in Cuba and in the rest of the world. We would also like to express our solidarity with his family and with the Cuban people on their path to pluralism and development.\nThis very sad occasion could act as a catalyst for a discussion aimed at positioning the relations between the European Union and Cuba, within a comprehensive bilateral framework providing for permanent, constructive dialogue on human rights, on an equal footing with the European Union's agreements with third countries.\n", "20. Request for waiver of the immunity of Hannes Swoboda (\n- Before the vote:\nHannes Swoboda\n(DE) Mr President, I just wanted to make known that I shall not be participating in this vote.\n", "Kosovo (debate) \nPresident\n- The next item is the Council and Commission statements on Kosovo.\nHannes Swoboda\n(DE) Madam President, we are discussing Kosovo today against the background of a very detailed report by Mr Lagendijk, the rapporteur, which is, of course, linked to statements from the Commission and the Council.\nIn this case the rapporteur has no official speaking time, which I believe is an appalling situation. If the rapporteur were only to present the initiative report on Monday evening, he would have four minutes. I think that this is unfair. I would therefore ask the Bureau to consider whether someone who has worked for months as the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs should not also be given official speaking time.\nNow Mrs Kallenbach has given him her minute of time out of a sense of solidarity with a colleague from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. Perhaps it would be possible, Madam President, if this is within your power, to give Mrs Kallenbach one minute under the 'catch-the-eye''procedure. However, I would like to ask you to think about this carefully. We need to find a different arrangement in this type of case.\nPresident\n- It is certainly correct that the fundamental problem should be dealt with. As far as this specific situation is concerned, I recommend Mrs Kallenbach to request the minute under the 'catch-the-eye' procedure because that would make things significantly simpler.\nAlexandr Vondra\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - Madam President, I am grateful for this opportunity to take stock of the latest developments in Kosovo. In two weeks' time - on 17 February 2009 - Kosovo will celebrate the first anniversary of its declaration of independence, and this debate is certainly timely. Since then, Kosovo has adopted a constitution and a completely new legal and institutional framework. The declaration of independence created a new situation and new challenges for the international community and for the EU in par", "7. Cooperation in vocational education and training to support the Europe 2020 strategy (\nEmilie Turunen\nMr President, yes, it is a very simple oral amendment replacing the word 'harmonisation' with 'cooperation' since this is more appropriate and more precise as we are talking about vocational training.\n(The President asked the speaker to read out the whole text of the amendment)\nSo it will read: 'Takes the view that better cooperation among Member States' different education systems - bridging those differences and ensuring mutual recognition of certificates and diplomas among the Member States - should be emphasised in order to heighten cross-border collaboration and aid mobility'.\n", "9. External dimension of the fight against terrorism (vote) \n- Before the vote:\nLuis Ya\u00f1ez-Barnuevo Garc\u00eda \nrapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, we are going to vote on a report on the external dimension of the fight against international terrorism on the day on which the trial relating to the biggest attack in the history of Europe begins in Madrid.\nFour direct victims of that attack are with us today in the gallery, Mr President. Jes\u00fas Ram\u00edrez Castanedo, who was seriously wounded in the attack; Jes\u00fas Abril Escusa, who lost his 19-year-old son; Isabel Casanova Ortega, who lost her 22-year-old son together with her father; and Euclides Antonio R\u00edo Grajales, who was seriously wounded in the attack. For this two-fold reason, I would be grateful if this House could acknowledge them.\n(The House rose and applauded the victims)\nPresident\nWe should like to express our deepest sympathy with the victims, and we shall do everything possible within the rule of law to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice. We stand in solidarity with the victims and their families. We remember with profound compassion those who lost their lives.\n(Applause)\n- Before the vote on Amendment 19:\nAntonio Tajani\n(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I propose that after Amendment 19 we insert the text of this oral amendment, which I believe also has the agreement of the rapporteur: 'in view of the recent discoveries of extremely dangerous terrorist organisations in Italy and France'.\n(The oral amendment was accepted)\n", "Referendum in Venezuela (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the referendum in Venezuela.\nStavros Dimas\nMember of the Commission. - Madam President, the National Electoral Council has announced that a popular referendum on the proposal for constitutional reform made by the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the National Assembly will be held on 2 December 2007. On that day, the people of Venezuela will have the opportunity to exercise their democratic right of decision on the proposed changes that would shape important aspects of the political, institutional, economic and social life of that country.\nThe Commission is closely following the ongoing constitutional reform process in Venezuela, as well as in other countries in the region. It stresses the importance it attaches to the fact that each new constitution or constitutional reform should reinforce democracy and the rule of law. It also believes that each constitution should be based on a broad popular consensus and adequately reflect the plurality and diversity of each nation. Constitutions should unite people and not divide them.\nThe Commission is following with interest the intensive debate on constitutional reform in Venezuela. It has observed that some sectors of Venezuelan society are in favour of the proposed changes, but also takes note of the strong opposition to the reform expressed by other sectors. Those sectors are voicing concerns, notably on aspects of the reform which they consider would - if the reform were approved - entail an increased concentration of powers in the hands of the President, a weakening of democratic control mechanisms and of the existing institutions and a threat to democratic pluralism. Others consider that what is proposed goes beyond a mere reform and implies modification of the fundamental structure of the state.\nThe Commission is aware of the situation and is paying due attention to it. While it considers that it is the people", "SWIFT (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on SWIFT.\nDiego L\u00f3pez Garrido\nMr President, Mrs Malmstr\u00f6m, ladies and gentlemen, last month, on 24 March, the Commission adopted a recommendation to the Council to authorise the opening of negotiations between the European Union and the United States for an agreement whereby finance messaging data are made available to the US Treasury Department in order to fight and prevent terrorism and its financing.\nThe recommendation was immediately submitted to the rapporteur and certain Members of the European Parliament and forwarded to the Council of the Union.\nThe Council of the Union remains convinced of the need for an agreement like this one and therefore fully supports the Commission's recommendation to negotiate an agreement on the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme. The Commissioner's draft mandate has been closely studied within Coreper and, in principle, this Commission recommendation will be put to the vote at the next Council meeting and we will vote in favour of it, taking into account Parliament's position, of course, and the opinions that will be voiced on the subject here in this Chamber today.\nThe Council agrees with Parliament that the future agreement, known as the SWIFT agreement, must include adequate guarantees and safeguards. It agrees, therefore, with the feeling shown by Parliament that it is essential in all cases to comply with the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights, specifically Article 8 thereof, the Treaty of Lisbon and the European Convention on Human Rights. In addition, there are fundamental principles that must be respected when personal data are transferred, such as the right of the person whose data are being processed to be informed, or the right to amend or delete such data if they are incorrect.\nAll rights relating to data protection must be guaranteed without discrimination; in other words, citizens of the European Union must be treated in the ", "14. Community ecolabel scheme (\n- Before the final vote:\nMiroslav Ouzk\u00fd\nMr President, I would like to ask you to include the following Commission statement on the record, with the text as agreed and adopted.\n'Independently of the adoption of the Ecolabel Regulation, the Commission confirms that it intends to propose a regulation on ecolabelling of fishery products before the end of this year, to be mainly based on criteria for sustainable fishing. The study foreseen in Article 6(5)(a) of the Ecolabel Regulation, dealing with additional aspects such as processing, pre-packaging, packaging and transport, which will examine the flexibility of the extension of the scope of the Ecolabel Regulation to food, including the products of fishing and aquaculture, will not influence or prejudge the adoption of this regulation'.\nStavros Dimas\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, I fully agree.\n(Applause)\n(Parliament approved the motion)\n", "Question Time (Commission) \nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B7-0411/2011).\nThe following questions are addressed to the Commission.\nPart one\n\nSubject: Colombian human rights and the Free Trade Agreement (FTA)\nActivists in Colombia continue to be threatened and murdered, as shown by the recent case of Ana Fabricia Cordoba, who had publicly denounced the threats she was receiving. Her children attribute her assassination to members of the police. Since July 2010 40 activists have been assassinated, and an effective response from the Colombian Government is not forthcoming.\nThe Commission always refers to the human rights clause as a means of improving respect for human rights. Yet Colombia is already part of GSP+, which includes a human rights clause. The latter has never been invoked by the EU, and Community leaders, NGO staff and activists continue to be assassinated in Colombia.\nWhat reason do we have to believe that the impact of the clause in the FTA will be any different?\nKarel De Gucht\nMember of the Commission. - I welcome the opportunity to discuss human rights and our trade agreement with Colombia and Peru in line with the fundamental values the EU holds dear. Let me start by saying very clearly that there is no leniency in the Commission in any form whatsoever on such grave matters. We are fully aware that threats and attacks against human rights activists in Colombia continue and I deplore them. In the specific and tragic case of Mrs C\u00f3rdoba the Colombian Government has not only unequivocally condemned her killing but has also offered a reward for any information leading to the identification of her killer.\nIt is also taking measures to strengthen the safety of victims as well as activists and their leaders. On every possible occasion the EU is actively raising the issue of human rights and in particular the need to guarantee the personal safety of human rights defenders in Colombia. Only last week the EU held a human rights dialogue with the Colo", "The state of play of the Euromed Free Trade Area (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the state of play of the Euromed 2010 Free Trade Area (FTA) by Vital Moreira, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade - B7-0222/2009)\nVital Moreira\nMr President, Commissioner, this question was drafted and proposed before we knew that Mrs Ashton would cease to be Trade Commissioner. We nevertheless hope that the Commission will be in a position to respond to our question.\nHer remit, as previously mentioned, is the current situation of the Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade Area, initially planned for 2010.\nIn fact, one of the projects which came out of the Barcelona Process, launched in 1955, was the creation of a free trade area in the Mediterranean region in 2010, which was supposed to be established on a regional basis, and include a North-South network and a South-South network. Nevertheless, this objective remains very distant, and I have the following questions:\nDoes the Commission believe that the creation of the Euro-Mediterranean free trade area in 2010 was a realistic prospect from the very beginning? Can the Commission back up its response with sound reasons?\nSecondly, Parliament is aware that a new Euro-Mediterranean road map will be adopted in the near future, possibly along with a new mechanism to facilitate trade and investment in the region.\nCan the Commission provide further details about the practical aspects and implications of such a mechanism?\nThirdly, can the Commission explain the current status of the Agadir Agreement, the EU's contribution to the rewording of this agreement and, in more general terms, the South-South dimension of the Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean?\nFourthly, can the Commission tell us how it incorporated the recommendations contained in the sustainability impact assessment carried out by the University of Manchester, with a view to considering social cohesion and sust", "The Union's efforts in combating corruption (written declaration): see Minutes\nPresident\nWritten declaration 0002/2010 on the Union's efforts in combating corruption, submitted by Monica Luisa Macovei, Simon Busuttil, Luigi de Magistris, Ana Gomes and Bart Staes, has been signed by a majority of Parliament's component Members. In accordance with Rule 123, it will be forwarded to its addressees and published, together with the names of the signatories, in the Texts Adopted of the sitting of 18 May 2010.\nMonica Luisa Macovei\nMr President, I want to thank those colleagues who supported and signed this declaration, and I would like to take this opportunity to call upon the Commission and Council to establish a solid and strong anti-corruption monitoring mechanism in the European Union. I appeal to the Member States to show political will and strengthen their fight against corruption before it is too late.\nPresident\nThe next item is the vote.\n(For results and other information regarding the vote: see Minutes)\n", "Wilderness in Europe (short presentation) \nPresident\n- The next item is a short presentation of the report by Mr Hegyi, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on wilderness in Europe.\nGyula Hegyi\nAround 46% of the world's land mass can be considered a natural environment, a wilderness untouched by human civilisation. In Europe, however, wilderness makes up only 1% of the entire territory. We must do everything we can to ensure that at least the remaining wilderness, this 1%, is preserved for the sake of future generations. This is the aim of my report, and I hope that increased protection of wilderness zones will sooner or later be integrated into EU legislation. There is a dual perception of wilderness in European culture. On the one hand, it is viewed as a place to fear and avoid, where monsters and unknown dangers lie in wait for us, as is evoked in many folk tales. On the other hand, it is seen as an attractive, pleasant place that gives us temporary refuge from the stress of urban and industrial civilisation.\nEnglish-language literature on the topic makes a distinction between the concept of conservation, that is, the proper use of nature, and of preservation, in other words the protection of nature from all human use. These philosophical debates lie beyond the scope of my report, but for the record I would like to point out that I consider sustainable development to be the ideal solution. The wilderness cannot be locked up in a bank safety deposit box, like a necklace or a package of share certificates. We have a right to discover its values. Thus we must protect nature, but by means of human use.\nThe territory of Europe is too small to have zones that are off-limits to its citizens. Discovering nature and encountering conditions experienced by humanity before civilisation teaches respect for nature and can serve as the basis for high-quality tourism. At the same time, these areas are extremely vulnerable to environmental", "Explanations of vote\nHubert Pirker\n(DE) Mr President, I rejoiced to learn that the report made it unequivocally clear that neither the Austrian Government nor any official entity or authority in Austria had any kind of improper part in this.\nI have nevertheless voted against the report on the grounds that the assertions in it are made without the backing of any kind of proof, yet they have not been removed from it, and, above all that the factual error concerning Europol has not been deleted either. What that means is that the report continues to contain a misrepresentation of the facts in which it is insinuated that Europol had employed members of the American secret services, something that is without any substance whatever and the very opposite of the truth.\nA report containing errors such as these does damage to Parliament's credibility and is a contributory factor in so many of its Members having voted against the report as a whole.\nMario Borghezio\n(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Fava report is worth little more than a collage of press cuttings; while it pretends to uphold human rights, it is in fact an attempt to demolish the power and effectiveness of anti-terrorism activities.\nThe demand to see the full names of Italian military secret service personnel published on the European Parliament website just shows the level of irresponsibility of someone who hypocritically says he supports the fight against terrorism and then, in fact, takes every suitable opportunity to prevent it from being put into practice.\nParliament cannot and must not grant itself the power to strip EU national governments and Member States of their full sovereignty in matters of protecting their citizens' security, which is and must remain the inviolable province of the nations and Member States.\nCharles Tannock\nMr President, the British Conservative delegation voted against the Fava report. We regarded this report as an expensive exercise duplicating the work of Senator Marty", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 12 February 1999.\n\nStatement by the President\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, several Members and political groups have drawn my attention to the fact that over the last few weeks a number of avalanches have taken place in France, Italy, and more recently in Austria, and there have been a great many casualties. Indeed, the latest avalanche in western Tyrol was the worst for the last 50 years. Five people lost their lives and 33 more are still unaccounted for.\nI am sure I speak for the whole House in expressing our condolences to the authorities and to the victims' families, as is our custom after disasters of this nature. I am quite certain that you all share in the sadness following these events within our Union, in France, Italy and Austria.\nApplause\n\nStenzel\nMr President, let me give you warm thanks on behalf of my delegation and also of the delegation of Austrian Social Democrats for your words of sympathy on the avalanche disaster in Tyrol. Let me also make a point of order. As you said, this was the worst avalanche disaster in Austria since the second world war, although of course other Alpine regions have also been hit, in Italy and France and in a non-Member State, Switzerland. In Austria, the National Assembly observed one minute's silence for the victims. I think it would be fitting for the European Parliament also to observe one minute's silence in memory of the victims of the Galt\u00fcr avalanche.\nI would add the further request - addressed to the Commission representatives - for funds to be allocated from the 1999 budget, from budget line B4-330 for protection against environmental and other disasters, to help the regions concerned. Aid that is given rapidly is doubly useful. Thank you.\n\nPresident\nThank you, Mrs Stenzel. I am sure the Commission will have taken note. It is not Parliament's custom to observe a minute's silence following disasters", "Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes\n(The sitting was suspended at 13.05 and resumed at 15.00)\nRa\u00fcl Romeva i Rueda\n(FR) I should just like to communicate some information I received a moment ago to the House.\nFor some weeks now, a new and unprecedented phenomenon has been occurring around certain large occupied towns in Western Sahara, that is to say, more than 12 000 Saharawi men, women and children are, as we speak, deserting their towns and moving into tents in the vicinity of Laayoune, Smara and Boujdour.\nThe movements, which are steadily increasing, appear to be a new way of protesting against the unbearable political and socioeconomic situation of the indigenous inhabitants of these territories.\nI am saying this today and right now because the problem posed by the many violent interventions by the Moroccan regime could worryingly become worse this weekend. That is why I call on Parliament to be ready to react depending on how the situation unfolds.\nPresident\nI will take it into account. It was of course a point of order and the situation in Western Sahara and the situation in Morocco are not what we are supposed to be talking about this afternoon. I will, however, take note of what you said.\n", "Estonia (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statement on Estonia.\nBenita Ferrero-Waldner\nMr President, I welcome this discussion on the recent dispute between Russia and Estonia. Let me state right away that this is not a human rights issue. The moving of the bronze soldier statue in Tallinn and the exhumation of the soldiers' graves were carried out with full respect for Estonia's international obligations, notably under the Geneva Convention with regard to war graves. However, I am aware of the sensitivity of this matter, which touches on the interpretation of history.\nWhile there have been concerns in Russia about this, we made it clear to Russia at the last summit that these concerns should be addressed through dialogue rather than through 'megaphone diplomacy'. We regret that the demonstrations that took place in Estonia turned into looting and riots. There is the right to demonstrate, which emanates clearly from freedom of expression. However, the fact that it led to a siege in front of the Estonian Embassy in Moscow was unacceptable. We have made clear our views about this and a demarche was conducted in Moscow immediately to remind Russia of its obligations under the Vienna Conventions.\nWe are concerned about cyber-attacks against official Estonian internet sites. These need to be properly investigated and the perpetrators must be brought to justice. We remind Russia of our joint commitment to cooperate in fighting cybercrime both in the context of the Common Space on Freedom, Security and Justice and by acceding to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime. Today the Commission adopted a communication on cybercrimes and we will certainly work on its implementation.\nWe are also following closely the situation regarding trade between Russia and Estonia. There have been calls in Russia for trade boycotts of Estonian goods and services and restrictions on transport operations. At one point restrictions were imposed on trucks cro", "Voting time (continuation) \nPresident\nThe next item is voting time.\n(For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)\nGraham Booth\nMr President, very briefly, I do not think you actually followed the Rules of Procedure correctly during the earlier voting session.\nYou said 'the voting is now open', but you did not ask 'have all Members voted?' before saying 'the voting is closed', and you did not read out the results.\nI think you were out of order.\nPresident\nMr Booth, the result of the vote is on the screen. As you have asked for all today's votes to be roll-call votes, that is what we are doing; what I am trying to do is to make this form of voting as painless as possible for the House, if that is all right with you, Mr Booth.\n", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nBernard Wojciechowski\n(PL) Mr President, 2009 will bring many changes and challenges for the European Parliament. Not only will elections be held and a new parliamentary term begin, but also, most importantly, the challenges relating to the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty will have to be dealt with. Life does not stand still, and I am not referring exclusively to political life. There comes a time when changes are needed, along with new plans and approaches to action. Generally speaking, greater financial input is required for changes to be effective. Nonetheless, the budgetary resources should be administered more efficiently and any unnecessary bureaucracy eliminated.\nZita Ple\u0161tinsk\u00e1\n(SK) I voted in favour of the report by Mr Paul R\u00fcbig, because Eurostars is, in my view, an important initiative of the European Commission to support research and development performing SMEs.\nIn spite of the fact that SMEs account for almost 70% of the EU's GDP, their potential in the area of research and development has not yet been sufficiently exploited. I would like to underscore the rapporteur's effort to enable the highest possible number of SMEs to participate in this programme. According to the original proposal, many SMEs would be excluded from the process since they would have to contribute at least 50% towards the cost of the projects. Following the agreement between the European Parliament and the Council, SMEs will be able to participate in, and collaborate on, proposals for projects in the field of research and development.\nI am pleased that Slovakia is among the 29 participating countries that have already expressed support for this programme. It is paramount that Slovak SME entrepreneurs receive information on how to access funding for research and development under this programme, and that the research potential grows in Slovakia and in other underdeveloped regions of Europe.\nThe European research and innovation da", "Explanations of vote\nGerard Batten, Nigel Farage, Jeffrey Titford and Thomas Wise \nin writing.

We have therefore chosen to vote in favour of those amendments that give priority to research, development and education and training. We do not, however, wish to support those amendments that give more money to direct agricultural aid and export subsidies for agricultural products, as such aid is already excessive and also results in inefficient agriculture that damages the environment and that, through the dumping of surpluses, helps increase the gap between rich and poor in the world.\nNor do we want to give money to subsidise tobacco cultivation, as this contributes directly to public health problems. We believe that such aid should quickly be cut back on and completely abolished before long. The money thereby saved could be used, for example, to fund measures designed to reduce the use of tobacco and dependency on it.\nBrigitte Douay \nin writing. - (FR) On Thursday 26 October, the European Parliament ad", "Explanations of vote\nPresident\nThe next item is the explanations of vote.\nDaniel Hannan\nMadam President, it did not take very long for us to get back to business as usual. In the run-up to the Irish referendum there were no end of reports saying 'please don't publish this until after the Irish have voted'. As soon as the ballots were safely counted, we have gone back to our agenda of harmonising policy, particularly in the field of militarisation and justice and home affairs.\nThe last time we met in this Chamber as an Assembly, speaker after speaker spoke about respecting the Irish vote, 'but ...'. Now we understand what the 'but' meant. The 'but' meant that we should disregard the outcome and push ahead with this process of harmonising criminal justice, civil law, immigration, asylum and the rest of the home affairs field.

As you know, that same night I sent a message to the Vatican, the text of which has been distributed to you. And on Friday morning I attended his funeral in Rome on behalf of the European Parliament, accompanied by Vice-President Saryusz-Wolski, as part of the joint representation of the European Union, together with Mr Barroso.\nI believe that today we must all pay tribute to the memory of Pope John Paul II, who leaves behind him the great legacy for humanity of his constant message of peace, love and freedom. He offered everybody a great example of faith and courage and endured the suffering of his later years with great dignity.\nAbove all, however, we in the European Parliament must acknowledge the gratitude Europe owes him for its reunification; his messages of peace and freedom undoubtedly had an enormous influence on the fall of the Communist system: firstly in his own country, Poland, and then in all the other countries of Eastern Europe. His contribution to the fall of the Berlin Wall, which then lead to the reunification of the Europeans, of which this Parliament is undoubtedly the highest expression, was undoubtedly decisive.\nWe should recall his words here in this Parliament when he said that Europe needed to breathe with both lungs. Those visionary words are today a reality, and the European Union is moving ahead with the unity we all need and which he wanted to see.\nJohn Paul II leaves behind him a legacy of dialogue, understanding and reconciliation amongst religions, and also amongst believers and non-believers. He was a great man and, undoubtedly, a great Europe", "Reprimand of a Member\nPresident\nI should like to start by making an announcement. The House will remember the publication issued by our fellow Member Mr Giertych bearing the parliamentary logo, which provoked reactions throughout the world. I looked into the matter as soon as I heard about it. On 1 March, the Bureau of Parliament unanimously condemned the contents of a certain section of this pamphlet. I have instituted the procedure pursuant to Rules 9 and 147 of our Rules of Procedure. This procedure provides for the imposition of a penalty; subject, however, to a hearing of the party concerned. I attempted to reach Mr Giertych immediately, but was unable to do so as there was no one at his office for a few days. We then established e-mail contact, however, in order to prove - including for our sake - that we had endeavoured to make contact. Mr Giertych has been away from Brussels for the last week, so it was not until yesterday that I was able to have the discussion pursuant to Rule 147 with him in the presence of the Secretary-General of the European Parliament.\nThe second part of my notification was transmitted to Mr Giertych at 7.30 p.m. yesterday via several technical channels. I shall shortly be presenting my conclusion on this to the House. At 8.30 a.m. today, this notification was transmitted also to the Bureau of Parliament, the Group Chairmen and the bodies of which Mr Giertych is a member - that is, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Delegation for relations with the United States.\nI shall now present to the House the second part of the contents of my letter to Mr Giertych, which relates to yesterday's discussion with him:\n'On this occasion, I deeply regretted what is objectively a serious breach of the fundamental rights, and, in particular, the dignity of human beings, to which our institution so strongly adheres. On this basis, I have decided, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Rule 147, that a reprimand should be imposed on you, whi", "Announcement by the President\nPresident\n(After the speech by Mrs Harms, see item 4.1). Yes, Mrs Harms. Regarding the matter that you have just mentioned, I must inform the House that President Buzek has made a public statement, which I will read to you.\nIt is with great sadness that I have learned of the tragic death of Natalia Estemirova, who was abducted earlier today in Grozny. On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to express our sympathy and condolences to the family and friends of the deceased.\nNatalia Estemirova was a human rights activist and a leading researcher, with Memorial, on Chechnya. In 2005 she was awarded the Robert Schuman Medal by the EPP Group in the European Parliament. We in the European Parliament have appreciated her work in the fields of human rights, promoting democratic accountability and the implementation of the rule of law.\nWe strongly call on the authorities of the Russian Federation to start a fully fledged inquiry into her death and to do their utmost to bring those responsible for this tragic death to justice. The European Parliament is at the forefront of promoting democracy, implementing the rule of law and defending human rights. It is, therefore, our obligation to support and show our solidarity with all those who struggle everywhere in the world for the same values, as was the case with Natalia Estemirova.\n(Applause)\nMs Harms, the Presidency agrees with your proposal to hold a minute's silence in memory of Natalia Estemirova.\n(The House observed a minute's silence)\n", "Banning seal products in the EU (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by the Commission on banning seal products in the EU.\nStavros Dimas\n\u039cember of the Commission. (EL) Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, thank you for giving me this opportunity to formulate the Commission's position on the ban on seal products in the European Union and to comment on the action already taken or planned.\nSeal hunting has been the subject of dispute and intense debate for many years now. I absolutely agree that there are reasonable questions in connection with seal hunting, irrespective of where it takes place. Nonetheless, it is encouraging that most seal populations appear to have stabilised and their survival is not endangered in their natural habitat. This opinion is based on the scientific statistics available on the development of populations of grey harp seals and blue hooded seals. There are no scientific indications of serious adverse repercussions from the hunt on the survival of these species of wild fauna.\nThe seal population in the northeast Atlantic has increased significantly since the beginning of the 1970s from just 2 million to about 5.8 million grey harp seals, which are the main target during the annual hunting season. In other words, the seal populations in question are endangered at present and, consequently, they do not come under the CITES Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. In order for these species of seal to be included in the C\u0399\u03a4\u0395S Convention, international trade would have to threaten their survival in their natural habitat.\nThis should not of course dissuade us from addressing the other important issue which arises in connection with seal hunting in numerous countries, including certain Member States of the European Union, by which I mean the issue of whether the importation and exportation and the marketing of seal products should be banned where the seals are not hunted ", "5. Draft amending budget No 6/2010: Section II - European Council and Council; Section III - Commission; Section X - European External Action Service (\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, we have now completed the legislative process on the European External Action Service. Above all, I would like to thank the many people who are now with us in the Chamber, the MEPs, for their exceptionally hard and challenging work. The chairs of several committees of the European Parliament played a leading role in this work. I would like to thank the chairs for their sound work, but would like to extend my thanks, in particular, to a number of people who represented this House both as negotiators and as rapporteurs, and whose names I would like to mention here. Their names are: Elmar Brok, Guy Verhofstadt, Roberto Gualtieri, Ingeborg Gr\u00e4\u00dfle, Crescenzio Rivellini and Bernhard Rapkay, as well as the MEPs who worked on the budget, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Surj\u00e1n and Sidonia J\u0119drzejewska.\nI have named them, in particular, because they put an enormous amount of work into ensuring that we obtained a good agreement on the European External Action Service. We believe that this agreement will be useful to the European Union. I would like to congratulate everybody but, in particular, let us also congratulate Lady Ashton and those who negotiated alongside her, and congratulate the Council on the result. Also among us is Ambassador Christoffersen, who also took part in the negotiations. Applause, please.\n(Applause)\n", "1. Pakistan - murder of Shahbaz Bhatti, Minister for Minorities\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Pakistan - murder of Shahbaz Bhatti, Minister for Minorities.\nJean Lambert\nauthor. - Mr President, I think all of us have been very deeply shocked and appalled by the assassination of Minister Shahbaz Bhatti, not least because he is someone known to us in this Parliament: he has visited here, he has met many of us; but also because this is another highly symbolic killing, striking at someone who was looking for reconciliation and work across all minorities in Pakistan.\nWe should also add our condolences not only to his family, but also to all the families of those who have been killed in terrorist attacks in Pakistan. This week, we have seen two such attacks, which have killed and injured more people than, for example, the London bombings.\nThe whole population is suffering, and intimidation is undermining democracy in Pakistan. We are seeing a change in the demographics of certain constituencies, for example, Quetta, as intimidation works to force people out.\nOur resolution is important in terms of wanting to continue and support the work, in terms of tolerance and mutual understanding. I would like to make the point that we need that in the European Union, too, where certain recent ministerial statements, in my view, have not helped that. So we expect leadership in Pakistan and in the European Union.\nMarietje Schaake\nauthor. - Mr President, despite the request made by the Pakistani Minister for Religious Minorities, Shahbaz Bhatti, for more protection after numerous threats, an assassin managed to murder him on 2 March. Our sympathies go out not only to his loved ones, but also to all Pakistanis who seek a more tolerant society. This is a real blow to Pakistan as well as to humanity as a whole.\nWhy did the Pakistani authorities deny the Minister's request for a bullet-proof official car, as well as his request that he select his ow", "European electricity network breakdown (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the European electricity network breakdown.\nAndris Piebalgs\nMember of the Commission. Mr President, the serious incident on the continental European electricity network on Saturday, 4 November led to blackouts over most of the system. We know from E.ON that the fault originated in northern Germany, where switching off an extra high-voltage line in Lower Saxony later led to the switching off of lines across Europe.\nE.ON had carried out a planned deactivation of an overhead line and this operation had also been done with a previous line. The incident led to the splitting of the Union for the Coordination of Transmission of Electricity Network into three zones: west, east and south-east. The western zone was short of power and the eastern zone had too much power. To cope with the lack of power in the western zone, automatic devices had to switch customers off in the countries affected.\nThe worst affected countries were France, where five million customers were reported to have been cut off. In Germany, millions of customers were affected, as in Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy and Spain, where some hundreds of thousands of customers were without electricity. Affected countries also included Austria, Slovenia, Portugal and Switzerland.\nThe incident was resolved after an hour and the power supply was re-established. The incident could have had much greater consequences but the cooperation between transmission system operators and the size of the network made it possible to supply customers very quickly.\nThe precise cause of the failure is not yet known. I have asked the European regulators to provide a report on what actually caused this blackout. That involves analysing a huge amount of information before the blackout and after the blackout, so at this stage I cannot report to you on what actually triggered it. The UCTE investigation committee will also provide a repor", "2. Guant\u00e1namo: imminent death penalty decision (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolution on Guant\u00e1namo: imminent death penalty decision.\nCharles Tannock\nauthor. - Mr President, the ECR Group believes that capital punishment is a personal conscience issue for each MEP and, although we acknowledge the EU's common position opposing execution in all circumstances, the fact of the matter is that many millions of European citizens, our constituents, are still in favour of capital punishment.\nFurthermore, this resolution refers to the potential death penalty being imposed on some of the most dangerous terrorists in the world, who thought nothing of conspiring to murder thousands of innocent people. Indeed, when reading this resolution, I thought of my own constituents who were mercilessly blown up by al-Qaeda-inspired terrorists in London six years ago. The struggle against global Islamic terrorism is an asymmetric war with unforeseen results and unprecedented consequences, and new jurisprudence internationally is now needed to address this.\nThe detention camp in Guant\u00e1namo Bay is a reflection of this tragic situation. It is also a reflection on the fact that the United States is carrying a disproportionate share of the burden for the global war on terror. Of course, all such trials by the US authorities - which, after all, is a country that is a democracy and shares our common values - must nevertheless be conducted fairly with all legal safeguards of due process, and ideally by civilian courts.\nAna Gomes\nauthor. - Mr President, Europe stands right against capital punishment. It should be abolished and the EU, particularly the High Representative and the upcoming Polish Presidency, and all the Member States, must firmly demand that the US exclude the death penalty as an option in the first military commission trial for a Guant\u00e1namo detainee. The case of the Saudi citizen, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, must set the standard.\nNot only would it", "3. Appointment of a Member of the Court of Auditors (Mr Gijs M. de Vries, NL) (\nDimitar Stoyanov\n(BG) This morning, activists from some environmental organisation took it upon themselves to deface sixteen of the twenty seven national flags of the Member States of the European Union. Whatever the point, whatever the cause, I believe, and I am certain that you will support me, that defacing national symbols should not be tolerated. Furthermore, defacing the Bulgarian national flag is a criminal offence under the Bulgarian criminal code, and the guilty party has to be handed over to the appropriate authorities. I am sure you will agree, regardless of the cause, that defacing national symbols of Member States must not be allowed.\n", "The demographic future of Europe (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Castex, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the demographic future of Europe.\nFran\u00e7oise Castex\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate we are continuing this evening began within these walls several years ago. It will not end with the adoption of this report, which still leaves some questions unanswered, and which we will undoubtedly have to come back to in the near future. In any case, I would like to thank the Commission for the quality of its communication, which has enriched the debate, and we have benefited from it in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.\nIn my report, I develop the consequences of demographic change, i.e. the shrinking of the active population, the growing number of elderly people, and the demographic imbalances between different regions of Europe. Is this to say it is impossible to act on the causes? I would first like to remind you that the 20th century saw two vast changes.\nFirstly, women gained access to education and training on the same footing as men. Secondly, women gained control over their reproductive lives through contraception. These are two factors of women's emancipation. They mark great, and I hope irreversible, progress for humanity.\nHowever, to have all the information for analysis at hand, two other things need to be added as well. All the studies show that European citizens would like more children than they actually have, and secondly, in Member States where the employment rate among women is high, the birth rate is also high. An active working life therefore does not prevent people from having children, provided that there is reconciliation of work life and family life for everyone, men and women alike. There is still a lot of progress to be made in this area, in all Member States.\nAnother point arose during our discussions, one that nobody essentially disputes. Economic insecu", "Statement by the President\nPresident\nYesterday another murder was committed by the terrorist organisation ETA. A 46-year-old army sergeant-major, Luis Conde de la Cruz, was killed by a car bomb in northern Spain. This was the third car bomb to explode in Spain within 24 hours. Several people were injured in the three blasts, one of them seriously. The European Parliament strongly condemns this act of terrorism and wishes to express its deep concern.\nOn behalf of the European Parliament, may I express my sincere condolences to the family and relatives of Sergeant-Major Conde and our solidarity with Spain, its authorities and especially the Spanish security forces. I would also like to express our support and deep sympathy to those who were injured in the bomb blasts and to their families.\nWe must reiterate time and again in no uncertain terms that terrorism is a direct attack on freedom, human rights and democracy. We cannot repeat often enough that there is no justification whatsoever for terrorism. For this reason we must act together in our fight against terrorism, always respecting the rule of law and applying the full force of the law. The European Union is a community based on solidarity. An act of terrorism in a member country of the European Union is an attack on the entire European Union, on every single one of us.\nI now ask you all to rise for a minute's silence.\n(The House rose and observed a minute's silence.)\n", "Commission Question Time\nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B6-0125/2007).\nThe following questions have been submitted to the Commission.\nPart One\nPresident\n\nSubject: Insurance companies in the EU\nInsurance companies will reportedly conclude insurance policies only in respect of vehicles which are registered in and have number plates issued by the State in which each company is based, despite the fact that EU legislation makes provision for the insurance of vehicles with number plates issued by another Member State. In the light of the third directive on direct insurance 92/49/EEC and the fourth directive on motor vehicle insurance 2000/26/EEC, will the Commission propose a review of the directives so that European consumers will be able themselves to choose their insurance companies and the State in which it is in their interests to conclude their motor vehicle insurance? Does the Commission consider that this freedom will also promote competition and thereby appreciably reduce the cost of insurance?\nCharlie McCreevy\nMr President, the principal aims of the EU legislative framework are a high degree of protection of road traffic accident victims, the promotion of free circulation of vehicles and the encouragement of cross-border activities of insurance undertakings.\nThe EU legal framework for compulsory motor insurance is a major EU success story. Developed since the early 1970s, it has been a fundamental factor in making the free movement of motorists and their vehicles in the Union a reality. The motor insurance directives have permitted the abolition of border checks on insurance, so the vehicles can be driven as easily between Member States as between one country. They also allow for easy compensation for the thousands of accidents involving vehicles from more than one Member State.\nThe motor insurance directives require that insurers have a local presence for claims settlement and oblige them to be members of the local guarantee fund and the local green ", "23. Creation of the European Return Fund (2008-2013) (vote) \n- Before the vote:\nBarbara Kudrycka \nrapporteur. - (PL) Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to an outstanding controversy, which is the requirement announced since the beginning of this Parliament making the establishment of a Return Fund conditional on the need to adopt a returns directive by the end of next year.\nIt is essential for this House to link the Return Fund with a Return Directive, but it has not succeeded in doing so. I would therefore like to inform the Council that it is possible that if a Returns Directive is not adopted, Parliament may make use of its budgetary entitlements and suspend payments to the Return Fund in the 2008 budget. That is why this matter is so important.\nI therefore call upon this House to vote in favour of the Return Fund, because previously the Council threatened us with a veto of the Integration Fund. I therefore urge you to vote together in this matter.\nUlla-Maj Wideroos\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council will continue its work, during which it will be in close contact with the European Parliament to ensure that consensus is reached soon on the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally remaining third country nationals.\nThe Council would point out that agreement on this proposal is one of the priorities that the Council and the Commission set in the action plan on the implementation of the Hague Programme established to strengthen freedom, security and justice in the European Union. The Council will do all it can to promote the achievement of this objective and remind everyone of the European Parliament's role in any agreement on this proposal.\nAndris Piebalgs\nMember of the Commission. Mr President, the Commission will continue to encourage the Council in all appropriate fora to make progress on t", "13. Enforcement of intellectual property rights in the internal market (\nJorgo Chatzimarkakis\n(DE) Mr President, there is an error in the Dutch version of the resolution on the Gallo report. I am listed there among the signatories to the resolution by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left as a member of the GUE/NGL Group. In this regard, I would like to say that, firstly, I am not a member of the GUE/NGL Group, I am not a Leftist and I am no Communist. Secondly, I remain a member of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe - a Liberal - and will vote for the ALDE resolution, as will many members of the other groups in this House. Thirdly, I call on the GUE/NGL Group to also vote for the ALDE resolution.\n(Laughter)\nPresident\nVery well, we shall correct this, Mr Chatzimarkakis, although never say never! In any case, we shall correct the positions.\nMarielle Gallo\nMr President, the two alternative resolutions have fallen. There is only one text left. That is my report which is a compromise ... Listen, Mr Cohn-Bendit, let me at least tell you that it is a compromise between the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the European Conservatives and Reformists and the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group. I have taken all of the sensitive issues surrounding intellectual property into consideration. I now feel that it is Parliament's responsibility to come to a decision. I do not see why we should give the Commission a free hand. Ladies and gentlemen, I therefore call on you all to come to a decision at least on this issue which will launch a debate and ...\n(The President cut off the speaker)\n- After the vote on paragraph 13:\nrapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I would again like to hold out my hand to our liberal colleagues", "11. Consumer confidence in the digital environment (vote) \n- Report: Roithov\u00e1\nThijs Berman\nMr President, on 31 January 2007 I sent a letter to the President of this Parliament proposing the organisation of an annual lecture to honour the memory of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya. This Politkovskaya lecture should be held by a journalist who distinguishes her or himself through an outstanding effort to defend democracy and respect for all human beings. With this lecture we would honour all journalists for their essential role in keeping societies open.\nThis proposal was co-signed by Bart Staes, Jean-Marie Cavada, Ewa Klamt and Luisa Morgantini. Rule 28 states that the Presidency has to answer within 30 days. I received only a vague reply and nothing has happened in the mean time. We would like to organise this event for October this year, one year after the assassination of our valued Anna Politkovskaya. We need the cooperation of the Presidency and we hope we can count on it.\n(Applause)\nPresident\nThank you, Mr Berman. I believe the aim of the brief reply was precisely to prevent the time period from lapsing. Clearly, however, I shall refer this to the Bureau and the President and check with them what will be done to follow up your request.\n", "Social package (First part) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Statements by the Commission and the Council on the Social Package (First part).\nVladim\u00edr \u0160pidla\nMember of the Commission. - (CS) Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, two months ago the Commission adopted a renewed social agenda. It is designed to help the Union to solve the social problems which Europe will have to tackle in the 21st century. It contains an ambitious and cohesive set of measures in the field of social policy, enabling Europeans to grasp the opportunities open to them.\nAs has been said already, the renewed social agenda was discussed by Ministers for Labour and Social Affairs at an informal meeting of the Social Council held in early July at Chantilly.\nI was pleased to receive a report on the very positive welcome of the renewed social agenda by Member States and I await with interest the conclusions which the Council should receive by the end of this year. I have already had the opportunity to present this package to the Conference of Presidents and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. A suitable time has also arisen for an in-depth debate here in Parliament. I am convinced that today's exchange of views will help us to reach a consensus on the question as to what kind of social Europe we wish to build for European citizens.\nI should like to remind you of developments up to now. This complex package is the result of two years of joint efforts. The Commission has been working with all interested parties, including representatives of workers and employers, civil society, Member States and regional and local bodies. The package forms a cohesive whole, emphasising links to other areas, such as education, health, environment, the information society and the economy, and it clearly shows that economic and social objectives are two sides of the same coin and must operate in close cooperation for the benefit of the people. It is an ambitious package, attempting to offer pra", "Explanations of vote\nCarlos Coelho \nAlthough I understand the need for Europol to carry out internal changes with regard to salaries and subsidies, Parliament has, since 1998, consistently rejected all initiatives put to it when consulted on detailed issues relating to Europol.\nSuch consultation could not be considered relevant while Europol remained intergovernmental in scope, with neither democratic nor legal control.\nI welcome the fact that Parliament's repeated requests have finally been answered: in December 2006, the Commission stated its intention to give Europol a more acceptable legal framework, conferring on it the status of an EU agency, funded by the Community budget, and giving its staff the status of Community employees.\nAlthough the process of transforming Europol has yet to be concluded, I have decided to vote in favour of this Finnish initiative on adapting the basic salaries and allowances of Europol, and this as a message of good faith and of complete support for this process of transformation, which I trust will be completed at the earliest opportunity.\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Goudin and Nils Lundgren \nin writing. (SV) The June List believes that increased democratic, legal and budget-related control over Europol is desirable. Because the Europol Convention constitutes intergovernmental cooperation, it is the national parliaments, however, that should exercise this control, and not the European Parliament. We have therefore voted against the report.\nDuarte Freitas \nBulgarian and Romanian refiners depend to a great extent on the import of raw cane sugar from third countries.\nThat being the case, in order to prevent a break in the supply of raw cane sugar to full-time refiners, tariff quotas for imports of raw cane sugar to Bulgaria and Romania from third countries must be opened.\nIt is in this context that the Commission's proposal, which will have no impact whatsoever on the refineries of other Member States, has appeared.\nI agree with the Commission proposal, gi", "AIDS/HIV in view of the XVIII International AIDS Conference (Vienna, July 18-23 2010) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on AIDS/HIV in view of the XVIII International AIDS Conference (Vienna, July 18-23 2010).\nCatherine Ashton\nVice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Madam President, honourable Members, I welcome the opportunity to participate in this session on human rights and HIV/AIDS. It is a timely debate, as we are only 11 days from the opening of the 18th World AIDS Conference, which will take place in Vienna.\nThe spread of HIV continues to cause considerable suffering. The impact of HIV is worse in situations where human rights are not respected, and we know that conflict situations can lead to an increase in HIV infections, especially when sexual abuse against women and children is common. In the absence of proper anti-discrimination laws, people living with HIV are often too frightened to come forward for help because of fear of stigma.\nIn countries where homosexuality is criminalised, some face the additional fear of imprisonment and, in extreme cases, even the death penalty. Human rights should empower individuals, including people affected with HIV. The right of everyone to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health implies that those who are affected by HIV must have access to information as well as to effective prevention and treatment options. Affected people should not be discriminated against because of that status.\nHonourable Members, we know that HIV infection is used in some countries as a reason to exclude asylum seekers from their right to seek protection. Infected persons may lose their right to work; infected children are sometimes excluded from school. The European Union has been at the forefront of the defence of the rig", "EU-Brazil Strategic Partnership - Mexico Strategic Partnership (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following reports:\nby Mrs Koppa, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the European Union-Brazil Strategic Partnership, and\nby Mr Salafranca S\u00e1nchez-Neyra, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on an EU-Mexico Strategic Partnership.\nJos\u00e9 Ignacio Salafranca S\u00e1nchez-Neyra\nMr President, Latin America is a continent with more than 600 million inhabitants, contributes more than 10% of the world's gross domestic product, has 40% of the earth's plant species and at the same time has a dynamic and extraordinarily active young population.\nDespite the economic boom of recent years, however, this is not the best time for Latin America in terms of its integration. This is what President \u00d3scar Arias said at his inauguration and I was reminded of it last weekend at a seminar organised in S\u00e3o Paulo with Alejandro Toledo, the former President of Peru, and Fernando Enrique Cardoso, the former President of Brazil.\nThere have been tensions between Argentina and Uruguay; the ALCA project has failed; Venezuela has left the Andean Community; there have been problems between Brazil and Bolivia over the nationalisation of energy resources, and between Argentina and Bolivia for the same reason; there have been disputes between Ecuador and Colombia, between Colombia and Venezuela, between Mexico and Venezuela, and so on.\nThis initiative by the European Commission, supported by Parliament and the Council, to establish this strategic partnership therefore sends out a clear, well-defined message that Latin America remains on the list of action priorities for the European Union, due not least to Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner's personal commitment.\nIn the case of Mexico, this strategic partnership aims specificall", "6. Situation in Iran (\n- Before the vote:\nJos\u00e9 Ignacio Salafranca S\u00e1nchez-Neyra\n(ES) Mr President, before we vote on this draft resolution on Iran, I merely wish to inform the Chamber that there has been an attempt to storm the Italian Embassy in Tehran and that similar incidents have also taken place at the embassies of other Member States, such as Germany, France, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.\nMr President, in Paragraph 24, this draft resolution calls for a European Union delegation to be established in Iran; my group would not want the adoption of this paragraph, which has been used in other European Parliament resolutions, to be taken as a sign of complacency with regard to these events. I would therefore ask Mr F\u00fcle to tell Mrs Ashton that the circumstances I have just mentioned should be borne in mind during the application of this resolution's mandate. I believe Mr Gahler is going to request the addition of an oral amendment to the resolution text so that the diplomatic interests of Member States can be protected in Iran.\nMichael Gahler\n(DE) Mr President, this has been discussed with the groups. I will read the text out briefly in English:\n'Is concerned about the nature of demonstrations held in front of EU embassies in Tehran on 9 February as being orchestrated by the Basij militia, and calls on the Iranian authorities to guarantee the safety of diplomatic missions'.\nLena Kolarska-Bobi\u0144ska\nMr President, on behalf of the authors of the resolution just adopted on Iran, I would like to request that the parliamentary services translate this text into Farsi so that the Iranian regime and people can fully understand the clear message sent today by the European Parliament.\n(Applause)\nPresident\nThank you for this valuable suggestion which we will forward to the appropriate department.\n", "Organic production and labelling of organic products (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Aubert, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on organic production and labelling of organic products - C6-0032/2006 -\nMariann Fischer Boel\nMember of the Commission. Mr President, I welcome this opportunity to discuss our proposal for a new Council regulation for organic production. I want to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Aubert, and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their efforts. The thorough work that they have been doing is a very valuable contribution to our discussions.\nWith 160 000 organic farms and more than 6 million hectares of land in the European Union, the turnover of organic products is estimated to have a value of between 13 and 14 billion euros. This tendency is on the increase, so it is indeed a very important sector. There is no doubt in my mind that this expanding sector has an essential role to play. It addresses a range of expectations on the part of the public and of consumers; expectations about food quality, care for the environment, animal welfare and opportunities for developing the countryside.\nIt is also a sector with plenty of optimism and confidence about what the future has to bring, as I was able to see clearly during my recent visit to the BioFach in Nuremberg. But in order to develop and reach its full potential, the sector needs an appropriate regulatory framework, and this is actually what we are trying to achieve with our new regulation. It is therefore a very important legislative proposal, and I am pleased with the progress that we were able to make through our deliberations last year.\nIn 2006 very intensive discussions were held on our proposal in the Council and in Parliament. As a result, some elements from the original proposal that proved to be very sensitive ones have now totally disappeared. This", "Implementation of the Services Directive (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on\nthe oral question to the Council on implementation of Directive 2006/123/EC, by Malcolm Harbour, Andreas Schwab, Evelyne Gebhardt, Cristian Silviu Bu\u015foi, Heide R\u00fchle, Adam Bielan, Kyriacos Triantaphyllides and Matteo Salvini, on behalf of the IMCO Committee - B7-0216/2009), and\nthe oral question to the Commission on implementation of Directive 2006/123/EC, by Malcolm Harbour, Andreas Schwab, Evelyne Gebhardt, Cristian Silviu Bu\u015foi, Heide R\u00fchle, Adam Bielan, Kyriacos Triantaphyllides and Matteo Salvini, on behalf of the IMCO Committee - B7-0219/2009).\nMalcolm Harbour\nauthor. - Madam President, it is a privilege to be able to make my first intervention in the Chamber since being elected as chairman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and to present this question on behalf of all the political groups on the committee as well as the coordinators. I am very pleased that many new members of the committee are here tonight to support me and to contribute to the debate.\nI do not think that this House needs any reminding about the importance of the Services Directive. In unleashing the power of the single market in a sector that comprises probably 70% of the European economy, the jobs that it will create, and the dynamic effect of that, are sorely needed at the moment in the stagnant conditions that we face.\nThis is a very wide-ranging directive. It has many new features. It is complicated in many areas. It has needed a lot of attention. The transposition of this, in a consistent and full way, is absolutely vital for its effective operation. At the very core of this directive is the fact that Member States will remove barriers to business and, in particular, measures in their own national legislation that discriminate against service companies who want to do business. Believe me, there are literally hundreds of legislative proposals or pieces of legislation ", "Financing instrument for development cooperation - A financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high-income countries and territories (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the\nRecommendation for a second reading, by Mr Mitchell, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the Council common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation (11944/2/2006 C6-0357/2006\nand\nthe report by Mr Martin on behalf of the Committee on International Trade on the draft Council regulation establishing a financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high-income countries and territories (11877/2006 - C6-0265/2006 -\nGay Mitchell \nrapporteur. - Mr President, this regulation has been in gestation for almost two years. At times, the pressure on Parliament to cave in, to divide, to give up our legislative role, was barely tolerable. I have been taken aback by the willingness of fellow MEPs, at times, to give other institutions carte blanche in this important area, so long as some little interest of theirs or influence was not lost. However, I wish to pay tribute to my colleagues in the Committee on Development - Members who did not allow pressure to divide us, across all groups, and who, in the end, carried the day. I should also like to pay tribute to the secretariat of the Development Committee and to the secretariats of those groups that worked constructively with us in these negotiations.\nHaving threatened to reject the original Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation Instrument (DCECI), as it was called, which sought to take away codecision powers by changing the legal base from Article 179 to Article 181a and to include developed countries and expenditure on non-development issues in a development instrument, we have negotiated with the Council and the Commission an instrument which few thought possible 12 months ", "2006 Annual report on the CFSP - Annual report on the implementation of the European Security Strategy and ESDP (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on\nthe report by Mr Saryusz-Wolski, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the annual report from the Council to the European Parliament on the main aspects and basic choices of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) presented to the European Parliament in application of point G, paragraph 43 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 - 2006 and\nthe report by Mr Kuhne, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the implementation of the European Security Strategy and ESDP.\nJacek Saryusz-Wolski\nrapporteur. - Mr President, I should like to comment and express the views of Parliament on foreign policy during this debate, which is more than just a routine annual debate on foreign policy and the state of play of foreign policy in the Union: the participation of Mr Solana with us is a testimony that it is a special debate. Thank you for coming, Mr Solana.\nFirst, we are at a very important juncture, if not a turning point, in terms of foreign policy because of the Lisbon Treaty innovations. We have to look back in order to evaluate as usual, but we also have to take a forward-looking approach. We have high and growing citizen support for foreign policy, for one which is genuine and robust. Member States' perceptions increasingly change, seeing that speaking with one voice and acting in common is the only way to have an effective Union foreign policy.\nEntering this new chapter of EU foreign policy, we are moving towards a qualitative change. The new foreign policy should draw its legitimacy not only from its intergovernmental source, but also from European Parliament scrutiny, hence, as we will see, the growing importance and role of the European Parliament in shaping this policy, as we called for in our report. We need an integrated and holistic approach to foreign policy, with", "Innovation partnerships (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council by Judith A. Merkies, on behalf of the S&D Group, Paul R\u00fcbig, on behalf of the PPE Group, Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, on behalf of the ALDE Group, Philippe Lamberts and Reinhard B\u00fctikofer, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, Ev\u017een To\u0161enovsk\u00fd, on behalf of the ECR Group, and Marisa Matias, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on innovation partnerships - B7-0560/2010).\nJudith A. Merkies\nMr President, 90% of people think that innovation will give us a green, more competitive economy, and we agree. However, evidently, the urgency of the matter is not yet quite clear, as the European Council has decided not to discuss the Innovation Union until February and March of next year.\nWhy is this? Have the urgent, major societal challenges perhaps all been solved already? Have the energy problem, the raw material problem and the ageing problem been solved already? No, they have not, and that is why we need to deal with and discuss this innovation strategy as a matter of urgency. There are plenty of questions. What exactly are these Innovation Partnerships? The Commission's innovation strategy is clear, but this question remains open.\nWhat is clear is that there should be no new - or at least completely new - instruments, but rather better ones. Long-term security is important, but we would ideally like a well-functioning instrument with a vision until 2020. What is important is that Innovation Partnerships be as tangible and clear as possible, have a real impact, be technologically neutral and close to the market, and have a clear deadline; and that there be involvement by all the important partners and also industry, the government, the research institutes and, above all, citizens, who are the driving force behind innovation and its success.\nIt is very good that existing strengths are being built on by means of 'Active and Healthy Ageing' - actually, healthy living rather than health", "Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\n\u00ccarinos\n. (EL) Mr President, I see from the Minutes that the question and answer exchange during question time with Minister Moscovici has been wrongly recorded.\nThe Minutes state, on page 14, in the Greek version at least: \"Question 16 by Mr \u00ccarinos: Violations of Cypriot airspace by Turkish fighter-planes. Mr Moscovici replied to the question and to Mr Marino's supplementary question and Mr Zacharakis then intervened\" .\nI should like to point out that in the morning the President of the French Republic, Mr Chirac, gave the impression, by appearing here in person and from what he said in his speech, that under the French presidency there would be closer, more systematic cooperation between the European Parliament and the presidency; however, in the afternoon, the first minister of the presidency to appear and work with us, the former MEP Mr Moscovici, did exactly the opposite. Apart from the fact that he was curt with us, he gave I think almost all my fellow members more or less one-word replies or claimed that he had replied, although he did indeed reply to the written question which I had submitted. But when I then submitted a second question as a result of yesterday morning's debate on the incursion of the Turkish occupying army into another part of Cyprus, instead of replying on the issue which I had put to him, he said \"I have already replied\" . Mr Zacharakis then intervened with two questions and Mr Moscovici barely bothered to stand up and did not bother to reply.\nI should like to ask, first, if a minister or commissioner questioned here is able not only to refuse to reply but to do so in a completely disdainful manner and if we are supposed to take \"I have already replied\" as an answer, when they have not done so. The same happened to other fellow members who, if they are present here, can confirm this. I should like ", "Prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances - Implementation of excessive deficit procedure - Requirements for budgetary frameworks of Member States - Budgetary surveillance in euro area - Surveillance of budgetary positions and surveillance and coordination of economic policies - Enforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in euro area (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following reports:\nby Mrs Ferreira, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances_-_C7-0301/2010 -\nby Mr Feio, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure -\nby Mrs Ford, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive on requirements for budgetary frameworks of the Member States - 2010/0277(NLE)]\nby Mrs Goulard, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the effective enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area - C7-0298/2010 -\nby Mrs Wortmann-Kool, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies - C7-0300/2010 -, and\nby Mr Haglund, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on enforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area - C7-0299/2010 -.\nElisa Ferreira\nMr President, in the", "Situation in Albania (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the situation in Albania.\n\u0160tefan F\u00fcle\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you for inviting me to speak on Albania this evening. Although on the European mainland, Albania was isolated for a large part of the 20th century. However, Albania is now open and accessible. It has become a country with a European perspective.\nToday, Albania is in political crisis. The developments in Tirana on Friday, 21 January 2011, were tragic. The increasingly bitter political stalemate has resulted in four needless deaths. The tone in Tirana needs to change. The dangerous downward spiral must end. The political crisis must be resolved. This is the shared responsibility of the political leaders in Albania.\nThat is what the citizens of Albania expect, and they are right. Democratically elected representatives must act as such: represent the people and find democratic compromise.\nIf the solution to the crisis lies in domestic hands, we as outsiders must do all we can to help facilitate such a solution. The External Action Service managing director, Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, visited Tirana twice to meet the President, the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition, and I am happy he has joined me today.\nHis messages on behalf of the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission, Cathy Ashton, and myself were clear: first, stop the violence and investigate the events of 21 January correctly. These investigations should be conducted by the judicial authorities without political interference.\nSecond, stop the verbal abuse and the implicit and explicit undermining of State institutions.\nThird, get the political dialogue back on track: acknowledge that you have a shared responsibility to secure a more positive future for Albania. In the near future, this means jointly ensuring the conduct of free, fair and transparent local elections.\nFourth, begin the important task of implementing the 12 p", "One-minute speeches on matters of political importance\nPresident\nThe next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.\nMany Members are listed, but they will not all be able to speak. I shall have to be strict about speaking times and I would remind you that Members who have spoken in either, or both, of the previous two sittings will not have priority. Members that did not speak in either the sitting of 13 November or the sitting of 29 November will have priority.\nZita Ple\u0161tinsk\u00e1\n(SK) As soon as the Commission announced last October that the free movement of citizens from the new Member States would be postponed until 2009, we voiced our objections in the European Parliament. We also launched several initiatives, including questions to the Council and Commission, and we subsequently drafted Declaration No 72, which is still pending. This declaration is designed to ensure compliance with the original deadline for accession to the Schengen area.\nFor this reason I regard the decision taken last week on St. Nicolas Day by EU interior ministers, enabling citizens from the nine new Member States to travel freely within the European Union from 1 January 2008, as a great success of the European Union and a consequence of the intervention by the MEPs.\nColleagues, I would like to thank you for your support. I am convinced that all countries, including Slovakia, will soon agree upon the strict security requirements involved in temporarily deploying an enhanced version of the current system as proposed by Portugal.\nKyriacos Triantaphyllides\n(EL) Mr President, last week Turkey made a 'Diplomatic move' by agreeing to open a port and an airport for trade with the Republic of Cyprus.\nTheir timing was a bit odd, considering that their move was made during the COREPER meeting. However, the Turkish proposal is nothing more than a clumsy, unacceptable and provocative manoeuvre, whose sole objective is to bypass the obligations undertaken by Ankara towards the Eu", "17. Interim Trade Agreement with Turkmenistan (vote) \n- Before the vote:\nDaniel Caspary\n(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I request a postponement until the April-II plenary session pursuant to Article 170 paragraph 4. Yesterday, during the group meetings, we received documents from the Commission and the Council in which the Commission and the Council are approaching our position. We did not have time to discuss these documents adequately, however. I would therefore be grateful for a postponement.\nHowever, I would again ask all Members from all groups to please refrain from using this interim agreement with Turkmenistan as a hostage by means of which to gain greater rights for Parliament in comparison with the Council and the Commission. It would be a great shame if this document had to suffer from this problem.\nStavros Dimas\nMember of the Commission. - We do not object to the postponement.\n(Parliament decided to postpone the vote)\n", "Amendment of Directive 2003/87/EC so as to include aviation activities in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Council common position with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2003/87/EC so as to include aviation activities in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community (05058/3/2008 - C6-0177/2008 - 2006/0304) (Rapporteur: Peter Liese).\nNathalie Kosciusko-Morizet\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Madam President, I would first of all like to express my gratitude to the Slovenian Presidency, to Parliament's rapporteur and to the Commission, who combined their efforts to reach an agreement on the inclusion of aviation in the European emission allowance trading scheme, and I know that it was difficult.\nThis agreement is a very important political signal and an instrument for achieving the ambitious objectives we have set in order to combat climate change. It is also an ambitious undertaking that is part of a wider political context, namely the current negotiations on the energy/climate package in Europe and the current negotiations taking place around the world on the fight against climate change.\nThe international economic and political context is difficult and it made the negotiation of this text especially tricky. Several factors had to be taken into consideration: first and foremost, the rising price of oil, as well as the need to preserve the global competitiveness of European airlines, the Union's desire and commitment to combat climate change, and the conclusion of an international agreement in Copenhagen in 2009. It was vital to take account of the interests of each party, including the interests of the regions that, as a result of their geographical sit", "Tribute\nPresident\nNews has reached us of the death of Otto von Habsburg. Otto von Habsburg-Lothringen was one of the first promoters of European integration and a co-author of the idea of Pan-Europa. For many years he was Chairman of the International Paneuropean Union, the oldest European integration movement. For two decades, as a member of the European People's Party, he was also a keen proponent of expansion of the EU to include the countries of Eastern Europe. A former Member of the European Parliament has left us.\nOn 25 June another of our fellow Members, Jan Ku\u0142akowski, a former member of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, died. As a Polish emigrant at a time when the Communist regime was still in power in Poland, he was Secretary-General of the World Confederation of Labour for 14 years. While I was Prime Minister, he was the chief EU membership negotiator for four years. Jan Ku\u0142akowski contributed greatly to the fact that Poland can now preside over the activities of the European Council.\nTwo outstanding Europeans with very different biographies have left us. Their lives were linked by the idea of a peaceful reintegration of our whole continent. They have left us, but their legacy to future generations, including all of us seated in this House, remains. The way that Europe changed in their lifetime is proof of how much can be achieved even when the starting point is one of crisis and difficulty. Let us not forget their input into the European idea. We will build on their achievements.\n(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)\n", "25.

The Maltese Parliament, for its part, unanimously approved the Treaty. This is an important political signal whereby Member States have shown clearly that they want the ratification process to proceed rapidly so that the Treaty can enter into force as planned on 1 January 2009.\nI congratulate Slovenia and Malta on this landmark decision.\n(Applause)\nFor domestic reasons, as you know, the Slovakian Parliament decided yesterday to postpone its vote until a later date. I appeal to all political leaders in Slovakia to fulfil their great political responsibility.\n", "Statement by the President\nPresident\nI have further bad news to communicate to you. It was with sadness and indignation that I received the news of the murder of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya. I believe that the European Parliament must pay tribute to this journalist, to her courage and her exceptional determination.\nAs you know, following the news of her murder I issued a press communiqu\u00e9 urging the Russian authorities to do everything in their power to ascertain the causes and perpetrators of this horrendous event as quickly as possible. We hope that in identifying the culprits Russia will demonstrate the state of democracy and freedom of expression there.\nThis event, on the eve of the Lahti meeting, is clearly of particularly crucial significance to us. On my own behalf and on behalf of the whole of the European Parliament, I would like once again to express our sincerest condolences to her family and friends.\nI also believe, however, that this is a good opportunity to remember that the murder of journalists is not, unfortunately, something that happens only on the odd rare occasion. On the contrary, many people lose their lives defending freedom of expression and information. It has happened in Russia today, but it happened in Lebanon the day before yesterday, in many Latin American countries, in many African countries and in many South-East Asian countries. People who produce information and create opinion often do so at risk of their lives.\nThis latest murder is no more or less tragic than any of the many other cases we have seen. I believe, however, that the case of Anna Politkovskaya's death and the cases of the 63 journalists murdered and more than 120 imprisoned warrant an expression of our respect for these people.\nI would ask that we observe a minute's silence in tribute to Anna Politkovskaya and the 63 journalists who have been murdered while carrying out their work.\n(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)\n", "Specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union (amendment of Regulation (EC) No 247/2006) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Alves, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union - C7-0255/2009 -.\nLu\u00eds Paulo Alves\nMadam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to point out the fact that we are debating the first report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that is subject to the ordinary legislative procedure as set out in the Treaty of Lisbon. It is an historic moment and, if this House votes in the way I am suggesting, it will get this new period of shared competences regarding agriculture in the European Union off to the best possible start.\nIt does so precisely by colegislating with its outermost regions, in a practical demonstration of the will to build a Union that is strengthened by cohesion, in a spirit of active solidarity, in respect for the specificities and differences of its parts, as the only viable path towards building our common European project.\nIt also does so by introducing basic regulations to make the sugar sector in the Azores - and I particularly welcome this, as that is my home region - more viable, as it is hundreds of years old. Furthermore, it contributes to the healthy diversification of agriculture in a region which, as we know, makes an irreplaceable contribution to Portugal's milk sector. We must consolidate it and make it sustainable.\nMr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Ciolo\u015f and the Commission's high officials, with whom we worked and negotiated, for the openness and flexibility they showed.

Welcome, everyone. Welcome to our guests.\nWe have before us one of the most important decisions in this parliamentary term. For it is to us that the citizens of Europe have committed the task of electing the best European Commission. We have completed the hearings, and I have received 26 letters of recommendation. For the first time in history, we are electing the European Commission as a co-equal legislator. This puts us under an obligation to work especially closely with the European Commission. We represent two institutions of the European Union. In relation to this, we have entered, provisionally, into a new Framework Agreement, and today we are going to endorse it. We are going to vote on this agreement at 12.00. The vote will be held at 12.00. Before that, there may be a short break, if we finish the discussion early.\nWe want the Union to be represented by institutions which are more dynamic, and this is why the agreement is so important to us. We also have the good experience of recent months. The hour of direct discussion with the President of the European Commission, here in plenary, has been a great success. We are going to have similar contact with the Commissioners, with the Vice-Presidents of the European Commission, and so we are going to have an hour of questions and answers which will help us to understand the work of the Commission. There are also many solutions in our new Framework Agreement which we did not have before. In their work, the European Commission and the European Parliament must also take account of the opinions of national parliaments, which represent the principle of subsidiarity in the European Union.\nI am sure this is not only", "Statement by the President\nPresident\nToday we are commemorating the fourth European Day of the Victims of Terrorism. It is a day that we must keep in our memory in order to remember all those who have been the innocent victims of terrorism.\nThe terrorist attacks in Madrid on 11 March 2004 -four years ago today - and in London on 7 July 2005 claimed many victims and left many families torn apart by the barbarities of terrorism.\nJust last Friday, the terrorist organisation ETA assassinated again. Isa\u00edas Carrasco, a former Socialist councillor, was shot when he left his home in Mondrag\u00f3n. I wish to express our deepest condolences to all his family. As President of the European Parliament and on my own behalf, I should like to reassure you that the victims of terrorism - wherever they are in the world - will never be erased from our memories. Today, we shall commemorate Isa\u00edas Carrasco and all the victims of terrorism, in order to assure the victims of the madness of terrorist attacks of our respect and our sympathy. They are and will always remain present in our hearts and in our work. Sympathy for and solidarity with all the families of the victims is a duty for all of us.\nThe European Parliament is actively involved in the fight against terrorism and in supporting the victims of terrorist attacks. I cannot repeat often enough that there is absolutely no justification for terrorism. We must therefore take a united approach in this fight on the basis of the rule of law and with all the force of the law.\nLadies and gentlemen, please rise from your seats for a minute's silence in memory of the victims of terrorism.\n(The House rose and observed a minute's silence.)\n", "Question Time (Council)\nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B6-0475/2008).\nThe following questions are addressed to the Council.\nI am sorry to say that we are short of time, but I intend to suspend the sitting at 19.00 as planned. Mr Jouyet has been here all afternoon, as has Mrs Ferrero-Waldner.\n\nSubject: Progress on the 'Blue Card'\nAt this mid-point of the French Presidency, what progress can the Council report on the 'Blue Card' and the related priorities of skilled migration and circular migration?\nJean-Pierre Jouyet\nMr President, I should like to say to Mr Moraes that the proposal for a directive on the conditions for entry and residence of third-country nationals for highly qualified employment - the 'Blue Card' Directive - was presented by the Commission to the Council in October 2007, as he is moreover aware.\nThe aim of this proposal is to encourage highly qualified third-country nationals to settle in the European Union. In order to make the EU more attractive, this proposal establishes common criteria for their admission, recognises equal treatment with EU nationals in several areas, and offers Blue Card holders opportunities to move about within the Union.\nAs you know, this proposal is one of the priorities of the French Presidency within the framework of the Pact on Immigration and Asylum. On 25 September, the Council gave its support to this initiative on the basis of a compromise proposed by the Presidency. This compromise focused, on the one hand, on the definition of higher professional qualifications and of higher education qualifications, and, on the other, on the relationship with national law; lastly, it focused on the minimum salary threshold for which a derogation is provided for in case of specific need within a profession.\nThe Council has given the Permanent Representatives Committee the task of finalising the examination of the text, with a view to arriving at a proposal very quickly, and final adoption will be able to take place after", "3. Sudan: Killing of African Union peace-keeping soldiers\nPresident\nThe next item is six motions for resolutions on Sudan and particularly the killing of African Union peacekeeping soldiers.\nMarios Matsakis  \nauthor. - Mr President, this House has repeatedly been dealing with the dire situation in Darfur, the last resolution having been adopted only in mid-September this year. The news that, at the end of September, a murderous attack took place against an African Union base in south Darfur, resulting in the death of 10 peacekeepers, the serious injury of eight other personnel, and the apparent taking hostage of approximately 40 people more, has come as a grim reminder that, despite our efforts, much remains to be done in order to secure peace and stability in this sad corner of the world.\nWe should, of course, recollect that at least 200 000 people have died in Darfur during the four-year conflict, and more than two million people have been forced from their homes. The September attack on African Union peacekeepers must force the EU and the UN to make sure that peacekeepers in Darfur are adequate in numbers and training, that they are properly and fully equipped and that they are given adequate logistical and other necessary support in order to fulfil their task safely and effectively.\nMerely sending poorly trained and ill-equipped AU civilians into highly hazardous situations does not, as has been demonstrated in this case, serve any useful purpose other than to reduce the cost in terms of money but increase the cost in terms of human lives. An urgent rethink and replanning by the international community is essential.\nLast but not least, we must not forget those 40 people still missing and thought to have been taken hostage. Every effort must be made to establish their fate and help bring them safely back to their loved ones.\nAlain Hutchinson  \nauthor. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, colleagues, after losing ten men in the raid at Haskanita, the head of the ", "35. Insurance and reinsurance (Solvency II) (recast) (\n- Before the vote:\nCharlie McCreevy\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to express my appreciation and admiration for the efficient handling of the Solvency II file by the European Parliament and for your willingness to compromise.\nWith Solvency II, the EU will have a modern framework for insurance supervision, which will then be official for the insurance industry and for policyholders.\nI personally regret the deletion of the group support regime, because it is a missed opportunity to make further progress in group supervision. However, the Commission will support the agreement between Parliament and the Council if it is endorsed by your vote.\nThis, of course, is not the end of the story. Much work remains to be done: implementing measures will need to be in place some time before October 2012 in order to give the Member States and the industry enough time to prepare for the introduction of Solvency II.\nI can assure you that the Commission will play its role in order to facilitate this process and to put these long overdue reforms into practice as soon as possible in the interests of all parties concerned.\n", "2. Parliament's new role and responsibilities in implementing the Lisbon Treaty (\n- Before the vote\nJo Leinen\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say just a few words in German. The fact that, to round off its work in this parliamentary term, this House has adopted five reports, all of which are connected with the Treaty of Lisbon, is an important signal for the European elections and for the time after that.\nThis House has always worked continuously and consistently for the Reform Treaty, even in times of difficulty and when many had doubts and even wanted to abandon the project. Yesterday, with the 'yes' in the Czech Senate, we took a huge step forward. Congratulations to the country that has the Presidency.\n(Applause)\nWe may now be justifiably optimistic that this reform project will enter into force at the end of 2009 with a positive vote in Ireland.\nThe newly elected European Parliament will have many new powers and capabilities. This newly elected Chamber of Citizens in the European Union can fulfil the promise we have made to achieve a better EU with more democratic control and more transparency. I thank all my colleagues in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, especially today's rapporteurs and the overwhelming majority of Members in this House who supported all the reports and made this progress possible. Thank you very much.\n(Applause)\nPresident\nOur fellow Member, Hans-Peter Martin, has asked to take the floor; it really must be for a point of order.\nHans-Peter Martin\n(DE) Mr President, I have just one question. If the Irish say 'no' again, how often must they keep going to the polls? A third, fourth, fifth time? That is not democracy, it is a karaoke parliament.\nPresident\nIt was not a point of order, but I had the good grace not to make a martyr of you.\nProinsias De Rossa\nMr President, I want to make a personal statement in relation to what Mr Martin just said. The Irish Parliament is not a 'karaoke parliament', and I object to it bein", "2. Somalia: routine killing of civilians\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution on Somalia.\nMikel Irujo Amezaga\nauthor. - (ES) Mr President, I would first like to express my deep concern at the recent cases of hijacking of boats in Somali waters and the hijackers' humiliating treatment of crews.\nFrom this same seat, I asked the European Union to adopt a Community policy of coordination and mutual assistance that would allow military vessels in international waters and flying the flag of a Member State to protect merchant and fishing boats flying the flag of other Member States at the first possible opportunity.\nIn addition, I would like to denounce categorically the trade in weapons and ammunition with organised bands and paramilitary factions. My group would like to ask the competent international organisations and appropriate regional organisations to recommend adequate preventive measures to stop weapons reaching such groups.\nMy group would like to ask donor countries and the European Union to respect their commitments and guarantee close coordination to increase the effectiveness of development aid.\nWe would also like to ask the Commission, represented here today, to propose a rapid, considerable increase in European Union financial resources for Somalia, particularly on the occasion of the intermediate review of the 10th European Development Fund, and also an increase in its physical presence in that country. I would like to take advantage of the presence of the Commission to ask what it is doing or plans to do in this regard.\nObviously, I cannot finish my speech without calling on all Somali factions to end one of the longest and most destructive armed conflicts in recent years and this resolution does the same.\nMarios Matsakis\nauthor. - Mr President, Somalia is a country stricken by civil war and poverty over a number of years now. Thousands of civilians have died as a result, and hundreds of thousands have suffered and are stil", "Crisis in the EU livestock sector (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Esther Herranz Garc\u00eda, Albert De\u00df, Mairead McGuinness, Giovanni La Via, Michel Dantin, V\u00e9ronique Mathieu, Gabriel Mato Adrover, Herbert Dorfmann, Georgios Papastamkos, Mariya Nedelcheva, Filip Kaczmarek, Jaros\u0142aw Kalinowski, B\u00e9la Glattfelder, Czes\u0142aw Adam Siekierski, Rare\u015f-Lucian Niculescu, Sergio Paolo Francesco Silvestris, Elisabeth K\u00f6stinger, Milan Zver, Peter Jahr and Maria do C\u00e9u Patr\u00e3o Neves, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), James Nicholson, on behalf of the European Conservatives and Reformists, and Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos, Paolo De Castro, St\u00e9phane Le Foll and Iratxe Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, on the crisis in the EU livestock sector (O-0141/2010/r\u00e9v. 1) - B7-0559/2010).\nEsther Herranz Garc\u00eda\nCommissioner, thank you very much for being here and for having shown so much sensitivity regarding this very important parliamentary initiative that is so necessary for the European livestock sector.\nThe sector is particularly vulnerable to the crises affecting EU agriculture as a whole, due to multiple factors: the high costs of inputs, the fall in market prices, imbalances of power in the food chain and the current increase in cereal prices.\nThe European livestock industry has to deal with these problems just like other agricultural sectors, but with an aggravating factor: the large investments that are particular to this type of production.\nAs the European Commission is on the verge of presenting its communication on the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), I think this is a very good time to send a message of solidarity and concern to this group of producers. In my country, Spain, as in other EU countries, we are talking about a structural crisis, and the cereal price rises have just aggravate", "\nPresident. \u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0 I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 26 February 2004. \nPresident. \u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0 It is my sad duty today to express, on behalf of this House, our condemnation and our grief at the terrorist attacks in Baghdad and Karbala last Tuesday, 2 March 2004, aimed at the Shiite community as they celebrated the festival of Ashoura. At least 170 innocent people were killed and almost 400 injured in those attacks.\nAs the European Parliament, we offer our sympathy and sincere condolences to the families of the victims and to the Iraqi authorities. We condemn those behind indiscriminate and criminal terrorist attacks, which struck at a time of traditional, peaceful and religious celebration. I ask you, colleagues, to join with me now in a minute of silence.\nPresident. \u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0 Colleagues, today we mark and celebrate International Women's Day. For almost 90 years, International Women's Day has been marked and celebrated. In Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland the German feminist, Clara Zetkin, who wanted a single day to remember the 1857 strike of garment workers in the United States, took the initiative in March 1911 when more than a million men and women rallied to demand to right to work, to hold public office and to vote.\nMuch has changed since then and much remains to be achieved. Women continue to experience discrimination and we know all too well \u2013 including in politics and in this institution \u2013 the glass ceiling which can operate in so many ways as regards possibilities of access, promotion and playing a full role. We also know the extent to which we in this House have debated the victimisation of women through rape, domestic violence and trafficking.\nToday in this Parliament we recognise and salute the leadership given by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities: it has played a major strategic role and I thank, through Mrs Karamanou, its chairman, all the members of that committee for the leadership which", "3. Decision of the European Parliament on the proposal for a member of the panel for the selection of Judges and Advocates-General of the Court of Justice and the General Court (vote) \n", "2. Darfur (vote) \n- Motion for a resolution\n- Before the vote:\nJosep Borrell Fontelles\n(ES) Mr President, this resolution is brought to plenary under Rule 91, as a result of urgency, without debate. It is certainly urgent and on my own behalf and on behalf of the five Members who have spent five days in Darfur, I would like very briefly to point out the reasons for this urgency.\nDarfur today is a lawless territory, in which everybody is waging war against everybody else. The great problems of our times are condensed there: the conflict between central and peripheral areas, ethnic conflicts, the cynical exploitation of rivalries between groups for political purposes, and perhaps the first war in the world to be caused by climate change.\nBut it is urgent because security is deteriorating even further, and if that continues, humanitarian workers will not be able to carry on doing their work. The fate of two and a half million people depends on that work, since they are fed each day thanks to their efforts, and partly thanks to European Union money.\nIf there is no improvement in security between now and the end of the year, we may find that two million people have been abandoned to their fate in the desert, in danger of creating the greatest humanitarian crisis the world has ever seen.\nIt is therefore important, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that United Nations forces, which we have asked to be sent to Darfur so many times, finally go, now that the Sudanese Government has no objection. The Sudanese Government is no longer saying no. It is now saying yes. It says that they should go as soon as possible, because it is no longer capable - as if it ever wanted to - of guaranteeing the least security.\nThe Janjaweed have not been disarmed. Quite the opposite. The Sudanese Government is not going to increase security in Darfur. If we want to avoid the risk of total humanitarian crisis, we must exert pressure in order to ensure that that force gets there as soon as possib", "12.

Hungary is occupying the Presidency for the first time in its history, which is always an important event in the European Union. During the Belgian Presidency, we developed new ways of cooperating with the Presidency and the Council, with meetings at administrative, Commission, ministerial and presidential level, or, in other words, between the Presidency and the President of the European Parliament. We will continue these forms of cooperation during the Hungarian Presidency too, as I have already established with the Prime Minister, Mr Orb\u00e1n. Today, we will discuss the programme of activities of the Hungarian Presidency. I would like to welcome the Prime Minister, Mr Orb\u00e1n, to the European Parliament. We are pleased that we will be able to engage in a thorough discussion of many matters relating to this six-month period and our cooperation.\nViktor Orb\u00e1n\nMr President, honourable Members, I am pleased that our presence has excited so much attention in the European ...

Firstly, the evaluation procedure. Since joining the European Union in 2007, Romania and Bulgaria have begun to work towards full integration into the Schengen Area. If the Council is to make a decision to abolish internal frontiers, the assessment procedures need to certify that all the conditions necessary for the implementation of the relevant parts of the acquis communautaire are met; namely, data protection, the Schengen Information System, borders by air, land and sea, police cooperation and visa policy.\nThe assessment procedures began with the part relating to data protection. This means verifying that each of these Member States is adequately prepared to implement all the provisions in terms of data protection. The results are therefore a prerequisite for the evaluation process for the Schengen Information System, which involves the transfer of data to these countries. Approval of this decision is therefore a first step towards the abolition of checks at internal borders with Bulgaria and Romania.\nSecondly, access to documents. The Council has submitted this draft decision to Parliament. However, evaluation and follow-up reports were not sent; these would enable Parliament access to all the information necessary to develop a reasoned and justified view. The documents were only supplied by the Council after Parliament's insistence.\nI welcome the efforts of the Ambassador of", "Commission annual legislative and work programme for 2003\nPresident.\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the annual legislative and work programme for 2003.\n\nProdi\nMr President, honourable Members. Today's sitting winds up two very special days here in Strasbourg. Yesterday we discussed enlargement and I confess the occasion was moving and gratifying. Today, in the presence of the full Commission I am here to present our legislative and work programme for the coming year.\nThis year the programme bears witness to a new method. In line with our agreement of last January, the main EU institutions have set up a structured political dialogue.\nOver the last few months, all Members of the Commission have been available to discuss the Commission's priorities in their areas of responsibility before the relevant parliamentary committees.\nI would emphasise that the Commission sets much store by Parliament's valuable contribution to this process.\nThis being the first year of application, there is of course room for improvement. This year's experience will help us improve in the future. But the results so far are very encouraging.\nLet me mention the major innovations of the working method the Commission followed this year.\nFirst, this Work Programme must be seen as a big step towards a more highly integrated and coherent planning process for the EU as a whole. So it is also intended as an important contribution to the Council's first annual operating programme as decided at the Seville European Council.\nFor the first time the programme sets out not only our new proposals but also the main proposals already adopted by the Commission and still to be considered by the Council. This will allow Parliament to take part too in planning this vital aspect of legislative work. The Commission hopes that the three main institutions can reach an agreement on the interinstitutional dimension of this planning process by the end of the year.\nSecondly, our new working method is not base", "Statement by the President\nPresident\nOn behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to send a message of solidarity to the victims of hurricane Gustav in the Caribbean.\nNearly 100 people lost their lives in the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and Cuba, and thousands of others are now homeless. Once again, the citizens of these developing countries with which we maintain close links through the Cotonou Agreement - the ACP countries group - are suffering the ravages of a new natural disaster in these regions.\nThe European Union is closely monitoring the situation in the affected countries and is sending humanitarian aid. The European Parliament will, of course, be closely monitoring the supply of humanitarian assistance to countries in the region, particularly through the work of its Committee on Development and the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly.\n", "Resumption of the Session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 15 November 1996.\n\nApproval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of the last sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nCorrie\nMr President, would you consider designating two of the lifts downstairs for Members of Parliament. The reason this House is so empty just now is because there are over 200 Members trying to get up in the lifts. Because visitors cannot get up they are using the lifts to go down to -2 and then back up again. If we had two lifts designated for Members there would be many more Members in the Chamber now.\n\nPresident\nI agree with you, Mr Corrie, but unfortunately that has nothing to do with the approval of the minutes.\n\nWatson\nMr President, my point is not related to the point just raised by Mr Corrie. It refers to an event which happened somewhat earlier. Today the chairman of the Committee on Petitions received a petition from some 4 million European citizens - one of the largest petitions we have received - supporting Parliament's call for a ban on animal testing for the purpose of cosmetics. Their desire to present this petition was notified to Parliament weeks in advance. The event was organized in conjunction with Parliament's services and yet on their arrival today they encountered long delays in entering and their technicians encountered an attitude little short of hostile from some of Parliament's staff. This Parliament should be open and accessible to the people of Europe and this kind of event should be encouraged. Would you order an investigation into the events surrounding today and find out why it was so difficult for the animal-testing protesters to gain access to this building.\n\nPresident\nI shall look into the matter, Mr Watson.\n\nNewman\nMr President, thank you for agreeing to look into that. I also wanted to say that a few minutes ago Parliament received a petition signed by the largest number of people ever. Over", "Female poverty - Equality between women and men - 2010 (debate) \nPresident\n\u03a4he next item is the topical item of the day, the joint debate on the following reports on women in the European Union:\nthe report by Mrs Mariya Nedelcheva, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on equality between women and men in the European Union - 2010 (\u03917-0029/2011); and\nthe report by Mrs Rovana Plumb, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on the face of female poverty in the European Union.\nMariya Nedelcheva\nMadam President, Mrs Reding, ladies and gentlemen, I was born in 1979 at a time when European citizens were directly electing their representatives for the first time. I am proud of the fact that in this same year, for the first time ever, a woman - Simone Veil - a valiant supporter of women's rights, assumed the Presidency of the European Parliament.\nToday, I am one of the 35% of women represented here in this Chamber. Never before has this figure been so high in the European Parliament. So whom do we owe it to? We owe it to all those women who had the intelligence, the strength and the courage to join together and demand their right to vote, their right to work and to education. We owe it to those women who, quite simply, wanted to champion respect for their dignity and for their rights. We have been fighting for 100 years now to combat unfair and groundless discrimination. Significant progress has certainly been made, but combating gender inequalities is a day to day task and we have still a long way to go.\nThe European Union has always led the way when it comes to gender equality. I believe that this House of ours must ensure that it stays at the forefront of this momentum even when it comes to the most sensitive of subjects.\nThe present economic crisis has made us face our own contradictions. As highlighted in my report, the effects of the crisis have been felt more severely by women and its effects longer lasting for the", "3. South Korea - death penalty declared legal\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on five motions for resolutions on South Korea - death penalty declared legal.\nRenate Weber\nauthor. - Mr President, after 13 years without an execution in South Korea, it is deeply sad that the Constitutional Court there ruled in favour of the death penalty a few weeks ago. The ruling states that the death penalty is a legal punishment that can deter crime for the public good. That is a commonly heard argument and merely a response to emotive situations in a given country at a certain time.\nIt in fact means that the death penalty is being viewed as a preventive force in the hope that, when a criminal knows there is capital punishment, he or she will think twice about his or her acts. We all know that many studies have refuted that idea.\nEven more important is the fact that an execution is irreversible; there is no way back. Roman law at the time of Justinian stated that it was better for a guilty person to go unpunished than for an innocent person to be deprived of their life. That was 15 centuries ago. Since the South Korean Constitutional Court itself recognised that the death penalty could be subject to errors and abuse, our concerns brought forward today might strengthen the democratic institutions of the Republic of Korea in the idea that this method of punishment should be abolished for good.\nSince the Republic of South Korea acceded to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1990, and is a signatory to most of the major human rights treaties, moving backwards would be very harmful to its international reputation.\nDavid Martin\nauthor. - Mr President, the European Union in general, and this Parliament in particular, has a very proud record - an honourable tradition - of opposing the death penalty. Therefore we can do nothing other than regret the decision of the Republic of Korea's Constitutional Court that the death penalty is not a violation of that country", "7. Reducing health inequalities (\nMargrete Auken\n(DA) Madam President, I would like to address the Danes in particular. In the Danish translation, the word 'equitable' has been translated as 'ligelig'. This is not a good translation because people will then think that it means 'uniform'. Thus, in the final report, the word 'retf\u00e6rdig', meaning 'equitable', will be used. It has a different meaning, and I will, of course, recommend that all of our colleagues in the Danish delegation - and perhaps the Swedes have the same problem - vote in favour of the word being corrected in the report.\n", "\n\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Ladies and gentlemen, today, 17 May, is International Day against Homophobia.\nI would remind you that, last January, our Parliament approved a resolution on homophobia in Europe. In accordance with that text, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has organised a seminar this afternoon entitled 'Ending the Hate'.\nI believe that it would be a good thing for the Members of this Parliament to contribute to the success of this seminar by attending it if they can, since, although we all say that we want to combat all forms of discrimination, reality demonstrates that, in practice, this discrimination still exists, that freedoms are still not fully guaranteed and that exclusion often generates violence.\nI would like to congratulate the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on this initiative.\nAgnes Schierhuber (PPE-DE ).\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013 Mr President, I have been in politics for 32 years and regard the freedom of speech and of the press as democracy\u2019s greatest assets. For two days now, early every morning \u2013 yesterday, it was at 8.15, today it was at 8.30 \u2013 I have been being followed and harassed by a team of television journalists, who have been pestering me with improper questions. I really do feel under threat. I would also like it to be known that yesterday \u2013 as witnesses will confirm \u2013 Mr\u00a0Hans-Peter\u00a0Martin was behind this team, although he was not there today.\nI would ask you, Mr President, to cause appropriate action to be taken, since I find this sort of mobbing intolerable.\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you for telling us about these events, Mrs\u00a0Schierhuber.

This is because of the continued existence of an unjust and disgraceful law that takes no account of social reality or of the reasons why women turn to abortion.\nIt is against this backdrop that we have been seeing significant acts of international solidarity towards Portuguese women, including the recent attempt by the Dutch ship belonging to the organisation \u2018Women on Waves\u2019 to enter Portuguese territorial waters. It was disgracefully refused entry by the Portuguese Government, thereby preventing debates from being held and information on sexual and reproductive rights from being provided.\nThis intolerance reached ridiculous proportions when the Portuguese Government sent two Navy corvettes to surround the Dutch organisation\u2019s ship. Following declarations made at the Cairo and Beijing United Nations Conferences, Parliament, in its resolution of 3\u00a0July 2002, recommended that governments should develop high-quality national policy on sexual and reproductive health, in conjunction with pluralist civil society organisations. Ample information should be made availabl", "School Fresh Fruit Scheme (amendment of Single CMO Regulation) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Niels Busk, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulations (EC) No 1290/2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy and (EC) No 1234/2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO regulation) in order to set up a School Fruit Scheme - C6-0315/2008 -.\nNiels Busk\nrapporteur. - (DA) Mr President, Commissioner Fischer-Boel, Minister Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has tabled an extremely constructive proposal for setting up a school fruit scheme in order to reverse the unfortunate trend of increased obesity amongst European schoolchildren. It is a proposal that I warmly welcome. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that children eat 400 g of fruit and vegetables per day. Unfortunately, there are very few children who do this. In the EU, 22 million children are overweight and approximately 5 million children are severely overweight. The worst thing about this is that the number is rising by 400 000 children each year. An increased intake of fruit and vegetables reduces the risk of a large number of diseases and prevents overweight and severe overweight. Eating habits are established in childhood and the indications are that children who learn to eat a lot of fruit and vegetables continue to do so as adults. It is therefore vital that we intervene at an early stage if we are to succeed in influencing our children's eating habits.\nExcessive weight entails a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and certain forms of cancer. These diseases constitute an ever increasing threat to public health in the EU, and the cost of treatment weighs heavily on Member States' health budgets. The Commission refers to its impact assessment, in wh", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 25 February 1999.\n\nStatement by the President\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, today's agenda opens with a series of debates on one of the most important issues for European and world politics today: equal rights for women. I am sure that we all agree that by including these issues in the European Parliament's agenda, we are contributing to what has been a long struggle. That struggle has had various successes but it is still not over; indeed, it would seem that it still has a long way to go. Its aim is to ensure that women have exactly the same rights as men in the employment, social and political fields.\nI therefore believe that I am speaking for the House when I say that by including these points in our agenda, we are demonstrating Parliament's political will to continue this struggle. It also demonstrates our desire to make progress not only in terms of legislation but also in the various other areas alongside it.\nParliament's Bureau is soon to consider a report by Mrs Hoff, who was asked to consider how we could make progress within Parliament's own administration to ensure that more women hold senior posts. There is a great deal of work to be done. Efforts have been made, but there is no doubt that we need to continue in the same direction.\nAnother important aspect is the fact that we are in the run-up to elections, and it is therefore an excellent opportunity for all the political parties in Europe to ensure that more women hold seats in this House. It would be a great pity if this opportunity were lost.\nApplause\nThe will of this House is therefore very clear and I would like to end this introduction by expressing, on behalf of the entire House, our thanks to the Committee on Women's Rights and all its members for all the work they have done to help gradually turn this ideal into a reality. Our fellow Members here in the House are among the most ", "Environmental protection from radiation following the crash of a military aircraft in Greenland (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Diana Wallis, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the public health consequences of the 1968 Thule crash (petition 720/2002).\nDiana Wallis \nrapporteur. - Madam President, Commissioner, this report follows on well from the last debate, which was on the general nature of the Euratom Treaty past, present and future. This is an actual, specific, individual case, which clearly highlights why this Treaty needs looking at in order to ensure the future safety of Europe's citizens in the event of nuclear incidents.\nThis nuclear incident and its sad after-effects for certain individuals have wider implications for the health and safety of all our citizens. It is, of course, the strength of our petition system that it allows individuals to bring such events to our attention when the European institutions or legal framework have not assisted as they would have wished or expected. Our citizens are telling us that the Euratom Treaty is not working, so we should listen.\nLet me take you back to an Arctic night in January 1968, still the era of the Cold War - indeed the facts of this story sound like an international thriller. An American B-52 bomber gets into trouble, the crew scramble to safety and the plane comes down in Greenland with an enormous amount of weapons-grade plutonium on board. Residents of Greenland working at the American base at Thule immediately set out across the ice with husky teams to get to the downed plane, the Americans desperate to get there before anyone else. Over the weeks that follow, many Thule workers were involved in the clear-up. They were not working in laboratory conditions. They were not wearing any protective clothing, except against the cold - indeed the clothing that many of them wore was so contaminated by radiation that it had to be destroyed. Over the months and years that followed, the ", "Consumer Markets Scoreboard (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Anna Hedh, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the Consumer Markets Scoreboard.\nAnna Hedh\nMr President, The internal market is an extremely important part of the European cooperation, but for many consumers it is nothing more than a vague concept. Irrespective of how well we recognise its importance, rules and provisions, we are all consumers and are all affected by how the internal market operates. I have always maintained that if we have satisfied and confident European consumers, we will also have an internal market that operates efficiently and thrives.\nIn order to win this trust, we must make the internal market more efficient and sensitive to citizens' expectations and problems. This does not necessarily mean more or stricter legislation and rules imposed by the EU. Information, education and self-regulation can often be a more appropriate and more effective solution. Irrespective of how we solve the problems, the aim must always be to ensure that we safeguard consumers' rights so that they can make good and well-founded decisions. This is, of course, also a good thing for the market itself. Therefore, the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection and I welcome the Consumer Markets Scoreboard that the Commission presented at the request of the Committee. We believe that it could be an important tool for the future development of consumer policy.\nThe internal market comprises around 500 million consumers and has a large supply of goods and services. It is, of course, impossible to examine in detail all aspects of the internal market. It is therefore important to use analytic resources where they are actually needed most. I welcome the five areas that the Commission has focused on, namely complaints, price levels, satisfaction, switching and safety. These five main indicators are relevant and applicable, even if ther", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nZuzana Roithov\u00e1\n(CS) As one of the shadow rapporteurs for the telecommunications package, I would like to say, following the successful vote, that I am delighted that this important amendment to internal market regulations in the field of electronic communications in particular will bring another fair process in respect of disconnections from the internet. I am gratified that the Council has finally agreed to our proposals. Our guarantees will ensure that disconnections from the internet will apply to real criminals such as terrorists or distributors of child pornography and not to ordinary users.\nHannu Takkula\n(FI) Mr President, in my opinion, this legislation is necessary, as we move towards a single market in electronic communications. It has already been decided under the Treaty of Lisbon that this is the direction to take.\nI am nevertheless very concerned about the importance of ensuring the basic rights of users of the internet and free access to it. One worry is its illegal use and its abuse, and, as we know, one of the biggest issues and problems at the moment is piracy. Piracy is increasing greatly all the time, and one of the main areas in which it operates is the internet.\nI hope that in future, we can invest in ensuring that those who produce creative work are properly remunerated for it and that piracy does not endanger their livelihood, as is common at present on the internet when files are downloaded illegally. This is the right step and direction to take, though in future we should pay special attention to the rights of creative artists and prevent piracy.\nDaniel Hannan\nMr President, see how stealthily, how silkily, by how many small steps, how insidiously and invidiously we have moved towards the establishment of a pan-European federal police force.\nWhen Europol was first established in the early 1990s, it was presented as a clearing house - as a regional branch of Interpol, if you like. Since then, bit", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 24 April 1997.\n\nApproval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of the last sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n(Parliament approved the Minutes)\n\nHallam\nMr President, I rise under Rule 3. I regret to have to raise a matter concerning the immunities of this House and a serious contravention of Article 9 of the European Convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Article 9 relates to religious freedom.\nLast week a Belgian Government Commission presented a report to its Parliament on the question of religious sects and various cults. In a particularly lurid and ill-informed chapter on the Pentecostal movement, reference was made to the Christian fellowship active within this Parliament in Brussels. The reference was clearly intended to place that fellowship within a pejorative context.\nThe Christian fellowship referred to is apparently a group run by my own research assistant in Brussels. It only meets on parliamentary premises. It is ecumenical rather than pentecostal, although Pentecostalists would be welcome. Research assistants who are Baptists, Catholics and members of other denominations regularly take part in its meetings.\nIt meets weekly in my office in the Belliard building, or a room booked in my name, and includes the assistants of Members from political groups other than the PSE, such as the PPE and the EDN. It normally meets in my absence but I accept full responsibility for its activities.\nI am now astounded that the religious practice of my research assistant and his friends in my office has apparently been subject to surveillance by the Belgian State. The Belgian Government has not given me, as the Member responsible, any opportunity to hear or respond to any of the charges implied in its report. I have no idea precisely what information is being collected, who authorized its collection or how i", "1. European Year of Volunteering (2011) (\n- Before the vote:\nMarco Scurria\nMadam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would very quickly like to thank Parliament, all the committees, the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs for their work on this report.\nWe have prepared a report which raises the profile of the voluntary sector. There are 100 million people throughout Europe who work in this field, and each day they selflessly give their time for the good of others and our community.\nThis is the work we have done, increasing the budget and improving local activities and EU-wide activities for the benefit of the associations.\nI would like to thank Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d and the Swedish Presidency for the excellent work we have accomplished together.\nI think that this year will mark the beginning of Parliament showing a true interest in this area, which someone called the backbone of our society.\nOnce again, I would like to thank all those who have worked on this important report.\n", "1. Ethiopia\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the six motions for resolutions on Ethiopia.\nAdam Jerzy Bielan \nauthor. - (PL) Mr President, the news of the ongoing arrests, humiliation and intimidation of opposition politicians and students in Ethiopia has caused outrage and these actions should be decisively condemned. The recent arrest and expulsion from Ethiopia of two European Commission officials, who were accused of attempting to help Yalemzewd Bekele, a lawyer and women's rights advocate working for the European Commission in Addis Ababa, only serves to underline the gravity of the situation. Neither should we forget about the fact that 111 people are still in detention following the mass arrest of opposition supporters during demonstrations held in June and November 2005.\nI call upon the Commission and to the Council to do everything in their power to initiate a broad dialogue in Ethiopia, which would involve the participation of the political parties, civil society organisation and the authorities, to agree on a permanent solution to the current political crisis. We have to do all we can to make sure that the enduring principles of respect for human rights and the rule of law are re-established in that country. In order for this to happen, the Ethiopian authorities must show the world that they are willing to resolve the current crisis. The immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners would certainly constitute such a gesture of goodwill.\nMarios Matsakis \nauthor. - Mr President, the issue of human rights in Ethiopia has been the subject of numerous previous motions for resolution in this House. Unfortunately, it seems that our advisory words of wisdom and strong condemnation have been falling on deaf ears as far as the Ethiopian Government is concerned. However, who can blame it for behaving in such an arbitrary and totally unacceptable manner towards this Parliament when the Commission, for reasons best known to itself, invited Prim", "One-minute speeches on matters of political importance\nPresident\nThe next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.\nElena B\u0103sescu\n(RO) On 8 February 2010, Romania accepted the invitation extended by the President of the United States to participate in the development of the US anti-missile defence system. This is proof of the confidence placed in my country, bearing in mind as well the professionalism which has been demonstrated by the Romanian army in Afghanistan and Iraq. Three batteries each comprising eight missiles will be stationed on Romanian territory. According to the timetable agreed with the US side, this defence system is intended to be operational as of 2015.\nI believe that the subject of anti-missile defence must be made topical and be put on the European Union's agenda because we must be informed about the risk of proliferation of ballistic missile programmes.\nI must point out that the new system is not targeted at Russia. In fact, some of the comments and requests made by Moscow have been taken into account in redefining the US system's new architecture. In the period which immediately follows, bilateral negotiations will be started with a view to signing the necessary agreements, which will have to be ratified by the Romanian Parliament.\nThank you.\nGeorgios Papastamkos\n(EL) Mr President, I am making the major assumption that the restoration of the public finances of a Member State of the euro area is the responsibility of the euro area itself. However, coordinated intervention is required in order to protect the common currency against speculation.\nThe horrendous financial crisis in Greece and the financial imbalance in other Member States have highlighted the need for politically directed European economic governance. In my question to the Commission on 17 February 2010, I proposed that a European Monetary Fund be set up. I am delighted to see that Commissioner Rehn is moving in that direction. We shall await the Commissio", "8. Children of Migrants (vote) \n- Before the vote on paragraph 7:\nPhilip Bushill-Matthews\non behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, paragraph 7 - the final paragraph - instructs you to forward this resolution to the Commission, the Council and those other illustrious bodies, including the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee, and the social partners but, unusually, does not instruct you to send it to the parliaments of Member States. So I would like to repair that omission and propose the very simple oral amendment: 'and the parliaments of the Member States'.\n", "Debate on the future of Europe (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the future of Europe, in which the Prime Minister of Sweden, a Member of the European Council, will take part.\nLadies and gentlemen, I bid you a warm welcome to this special sitting. In particular, I wish to extend a very warm welcome to Mr Fredrik Reinfeldt, Prime Minister of Sweden. V\u00e4lkommen till Europaparlamentet! Welcome!\n(Applause)\nIt gives me - and all of us - great pleasure, Prime Minister, to welcome you today to the European Parliament for the first time to discuss the future of the European Union with us.\nI have just seen Simeon Sakskoburggotski, the former Prime Minister of Bulgaria, in the gallery. I bid you a warm welcome to the European Parliament.\nThe Treaty that was signed in Lisbon on 13 December 2007 takes the European Union in a new direction. After many years of discussion, we finally have a Treaty that matches the needs of the enlarged European Union, enabling it to devote itself to fulfilling the hopes and expectations of the European people by means of democratic procedures. Not only will the new Treaty provide for more transparency in the activity of the Union, which has always been a matter of particular importance to Sweden; it also makes combating climate change a new aim of the European Union, and that is an area in which Sweden can already boast major successes. Your country, Prime Minister, has every reason to be proud of its leading role in Europe in the use of renewable energy sources. We in the European Union must be united in pursuing the offensive against climate change, so that we can jointly play a leading global role in that struggle. Only last week at the United Nations, I saw what great hopes the UN places in the European Union in particular, as well as in the European Parliament as its legislative arm.\nThe Lisbon Treaty gives us instruments to pursue the goals that are important to our future, and to implement rapidly the reforms we need for th", "Worrying situation in the retention centres for immigrants, especially in the islands of Mayotte and Lampedusa (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on the worrying situation in the retention centres for immigrants, especially in the islands of Mayotte and Lampedusa.\nAlexandr Vondra\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I am grateful for the opportunity to address you on the issue of the situation in the immigration and detention centres situated in the European Union, of which you have highlighted two in particular, i.e. Mayotte and Lampedusa. I am very aware of the close interest you have shown in these centres, of the various visits which some of you have made, and of the concerns you have expressed about the conditions in some of them.\nI should like to begin by underlining two fundamental principles which lie at the heart of today's debate. The first is the need, in the case of third-country nationals requiring international protection, for full compliance with the commitments which we have given, as enshrined in various international instruments. The second is that we respect fully the human rights and the dignity of migrants and members of their families.\nWe are all very aware of the pressure resulting from migrants entering the European Union, as well as those seeking asylum here. This pressure is particularly great along the Union's southern and eastern borders.\nWe have responded by developing, over the last 10 years, an effective EU asylum and migration policy. However, the significant increase in the level of arrivals underlines the need for this policy to be strengthened and further developed.\nWe need to do this internally in order to establish our own common standards and rules in the area of asylum and migration, but we also need to act externally, in partnership with countries of origin and transit, in order to manage migration flows more efficiently.\nAll parties stand to gain by such an approach. The ", "Competition: Sector inquiry on retail banking - Retail Financial Services in the Single Market (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following reports:\nby Gianni Pittella, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on Competition: Sector inquiry on retail banking\n;\nby Othmar Karas, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Green Paper on Retail Financial Services in the Single Market.\nGianni Pittella\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to the careful investigative work carried out by the European Commission, we have been able to put the rigidity that is characteristic of retail banking services under the spotlight. This investigative work is one to which we have dedicated ourselves, alongside Mr Karas, and so far it has enjoyed a very broad, and in fact nearly unanimous, consensus in the relevant committee. I would therefore like to take the opportunity to express my particular thanks to Commissioner Kroes for the way in which she has always been available for debate with Parliament on this delicate matter.\nThe relationship between consumers and banks in Europe remains complicated because of the distortions that are a feature of the sector. This relationship is, however, of fundamental importance and we ought to put it right by pointing out inadequacies and inefficiencies, identifying the main problems and possible approaches for solving them. As my report and the report by Mr Karas state, actions of this type ought above all to be directed towards facilitating consumer mobility, so as to push the banks, indirectly, to operate at higher standards of efficiency.\nThat is why, in my report, I ask for it to be made simple and inexpensive for consumers to change banks. Changing banks is still, in too many cases across Europe, a slow and difficult operation. We are also opposed to any sort of contractual tie that is not clearly necessary, that prevents or hinders customer mobility. We recommend that", "\n\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is the debate on the Commission communication on the European Communication Strategy \u2013 White Paper. \nMargot Wallstr\u00f6m,\n\u00a0\u00a0 . Mr President, I should like to thank you and the honourable Members for being here this early morning. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to present to you the White Paper on a European communication policy adopted by the Commission at its meeting yesterday.\nThis is not the first time I have spoken about the White Paper in this House. I first announced it during the debate on the Herrero report, which has been an important reference for my subsequent work. During the preparation stages for the White Paper I regularly informed the European Parliament about my ideas, meeting with the different political groups, committees etc., and I am sure that several of you will find the key concepts and messages of the White Paper quite familiar.\nThe feedback and encouragement I have received make me believe that I will continue to find, in this House, the most committed and precious ally when it comes to communication. Communication is first and foremost a matter of democracy. People have a right to know what the European Union does and what it stands for, and as citizens they have a right to fully participate in the European project. This is the key message of the White Paper.\nThere is a worrying gap between the European Union and its citizens. Seven out of ten interviewed in Eurobarometer polls say that they know little or nothing about the European Union. More than half feel that their voice does not count when it comes to European issues. Trust in the European institutions is falling and so is the number of those who believe that Europe brings benefits to them or their countries. The perception of a communication gap between the European Union and its citizens is not new. It has been a subject of discussion in EU circles at least since the referendums that preceded the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992.", "The EU strategy for relations with Latin America (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Salafranca S\u00e1nchez-Neyra, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the EU strategy for relations with Latin America.\nJos\u00e9 Ignacio Salafranca S\u00e1nchez-Neyra\nMadam President, High Representative, I would like to say that the report, as adopted by the committee, on the one hand, acknowledges the efforts made by the Spanish Presidency of the European Union - which I do not see in this Chamber, which surprises me given that we are talking about a Latin American matter - and, on the other hand, welcomes the Commission communication entitled 'The European Union and Latin America: Global Players in Partnership'. I think it is difficult to find two regions that have more in common in terms of values and interests than Europe and Latin America.\nThe figures, Madam President, are very well known: together, they have more than a billion citizens, account for more than 25% of global gross domestic product and, along with the Caribbean countries, include almost one third of the countries that make up the United Nations.\nIt is also well known, although the figures show a slight decline, that the European Union is the main donor of development aid, the main investor in the region and the second largest trading partner in Latin America, and the largest in Mercosur and Chile.\nHowever, more importantly than the figures, we consider Latin America to be more than a market for Europe, and we therefore share a whole series of principles and values, which are pluralist and representative democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, freedom of expression, the constitutional state, the rule of law, respect for due process and the rejection of all forms of dictatorship and authoritarian rule.\nThis summit, Mrs Ashton, comes at a very remarkable time in the calendar for the European Union and Latin America. It is a remarkable time for the European Union, because having ", "3. Guinea (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Guinea.\nErik Meijer \nauthor. - (NL) Mr President, when in 1958, France agreed to self-determination for its West African colonies, Guinea was the only one to decide in favour of immediate and complete independence. In the 11 other colonially governed areas, the elite chose, often disregarding the will of their own people, to perpetuate close administrative, military and economic ties with France. Guinea, on the other hand, followed the example of the former British colony Ghana, which had gained independence one year earlier, and which wanted to develop an African model of socialism with strong participation of the own population. The leaders Sekou Tour\u00e9 and Kwame Nkrumah inspired many Africans in their battle for a better future, in which colonialism and poverty were set to be replaced by equality and development. Unfortunately, a military coup in both countries stopped this development in its tracks. In Guinea, Cont\u00e9 has wielded dictatorial power since 1984. Most parties did not take part in the elections that were organised under his control, and the official opposition that was represented in parliament was forced to leave it. The trade union confederations CNTG and USTG are now the main force in the fight for democracy. The presidential security force, led by the dictator's son, responded to their protest rally on 22 January by killing 59 people and wounding 150 others. The dictator increasingly treats the country as his own private property. Like many other countries that are run by dictators, Guinea is also becoming the victim of the fight over natural resources among factions that want to get their hands on the revenues from them. In this case, the resources in question are gold, iron and bauxite. This resolution stands up for the demands of the democratic opposition, and it enjoys my group's support.\nMarie Anne Isler B\u00e9guin \nauthor. - (FR) Mr President, I wish to tha", "European ports policy (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Josu Ortuondo Larrea, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on a European ports policy.\nJosu Ortuondo Larrea\nMadam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, along around one hundred thousand kilometres of coast in the united Europe, we have more than one thousand two hundred merchant ports, as well as several hundred more dotted along the thirty-six thousand kilometres of internal waterways. 90% of our international trade passes through them, as well as 40% of the tonnes per kilometre of intra-Community trade.\nPorts generate half a million jobs and guarantee the development of entire regions. They are also key for the regular passenger and ferry services, which provide social cohesion for the islands and other territories that are more easily and more sustainably reached by sea. There is therefore no doubt that we are talking about a sector that is of great importance for our well-being. Nevertheless, our ports are facing major challenges, including the increase in international demand for transport, which is increasing even faster than the rate of global economic growth.\nIn this context it is worth mentioning the advances in navigation technologies, logistical telecommunications and exploitation, the commitment to reduce pollution and greenhouse gases, securing new investment and the need to bring training up to date for the staff that manage and deal with these aspects. However, ports also have the challenge of maintaining dialogue and coordinated action with their respective surrounding areas, neighbours, cities and regions, and to develop the best possible connections and convenience in relation to other modes of transport, for their mutual benefit and in order to seek the most harmonious and sustainable planning solutions.\nThe ports are also part of our internal market, and they therefore have to comply with the relevant Community parameters. The Committee on Transport ", "9. Intelligent Transport Systems in the field of road transport and interfaces with other transport modes (\n- Before the vote:\nAlexander Alvaro\nMr President, with the utmost respect, I believe you would gain a lot of popularity, and it would be received with a lot of admiration, if you could speed up the voting procedure.\n(Applause)\nPresident\nThank you very much for the advice, Mr Alvaro. Of course, it is obvious that you have no experience of this.\n", "Airport charges\nPresident\nThe next item is the recommendation for second reading by Ulrich Stockmann, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on airport charges (08332/2/2008 - C6-0259/2008 -.\nUlrich Stockmann\nrapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after this very moving issue, we now move on to more technical matters. We want to pass the directive on airport charges at second reading tomorrow and, after the clear vote in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I am certain that we shall be able to do so.\nWhat is this directive about? It introduces uniform principles and procedures throughout Europe for levying airport charges. This means that transparent bases for calculation, non-discrimination against airlines and a set consultation procedure are some of the factors used to establish fair airport charges. An independent supervisory authority can resolve conflicts which arise on the basis of clear rules. This will strengthen the systemic partnership between airports and airlines and prevent any possible abuse of market power.\nWhat was the starting point? Over the past 15 years we have made two attempts to reconcile the conflicting interests of airports and airlines in this area. One of the reasons they failed was because we have totally different procedures and structures in the Member States. In the United Kingdom, for example, there is a strict regulatory authority which can set ceilings, in five Member States we have airport networks and the practice of cross-subsidy, we have parliaments which decide on airport charges, decentralised competences in Germany and much more besides. Nonetheless, we have managed to negotiate a sustainable compromise with the Council.\nWhat now are the components of this compromise? We have set the scope at airports with over five million passengers a year, plus the largest airports of a Member State. At present that means that the directive applies to 69 airports in the European Union. We", "11. Equality between women and men - 2010 (\nSergio Paolo Francesco Silvestris\n(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in paragraph 66, after the phrase 'stresses that women should have control over their sexual and reproductive rights, particularly through easy access to contraception and abortion', through this oral amendment, I propose that the following text should be added after the word 'abortion': 'whilst also recognising the right to life of the unborn child, calls on Member States and the Commission to implement measures and actions to support the continuation of the pregnancy by bringing in specific social and welfare policies which help women to overcome, wherever possible, the causes that lead them to choose abortion'.\nThis oral amendment is to ensure the freedom of women to have safe access to the termination of a pregnancy, but also to affirm the principle that abortion is not a delayed method of contraception nor a means of birth control.\n", "Pharmacovigilance of medicinal products (amendment of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004) - Pharmacovigilance (amendment of Directive 2001/83/EC) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following reports:\nthe report by Mrs McAvan, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending, as regards pharmacovigilance of medicinal products for human use, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency - C6-0515/2008-; and\nthe report by Mrs McAvan, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending, as regards pharmacovigilance, Directive 2001/83/EC on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use - C6-0514/2008-.\nLinda McAvan\nrapporteur. - Mr President, I am sure everybody in this room has taken pharmaceutical products at some time or other. The safety of those products is of paramount importance for public health.\nLast week, at a meeting of experts to talk about this new legislation, we were reminded that 2010 marks the 50th anniversary of thalidomide. Anybody my age will certainly remember what thalidomide meant: the images of children born with no limbs. Lessons were learned from that experience, and, over the years, governments developed pharmacovigilance systems to monitor the safety of medicines, because it became clear that clinical trials alone would never be enough to ensure that, when we put medicines out into the public domain, we would know all the side effects in advance.\nImprovements have been made. Last week, experts told us that, with the improvements we have already made, it would have taken only a handful of cases of thalidomide to actually identify the pr", "Outcome of the summit of 7 May 2010 and the ECOFIN meeting - What is the political relevance of the EU 2020 strategy in the context of the current financial and economic crisis? - Consequences of the financial and economic crisis on the EU 2020 strategy and its governance - What is the relevance of the EU 2020 strategy in the framework of the current financial and economic crisis?

This has been the case for a few months, and the origin does not go back a few months, but a few years, when the subprime crisis occurred in the United States.\nThe origin was, therefore, a financial crisis in the private sector of the financial system, which rapidly became something that was affecting the real economy in the form of a deep depression, which, technically speaking, was a deep recession. This involved a decline in production and a significant increase in unemployment, which was particularly serious in those countries in which the property or residential construction sectors had a significant influence.\nThere was an immediate reaction from the Member States and the central banks in order to prevent the financial sys", "Israeli military operation against the humanitarian flotilla and the Gaza blockade (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the Israeli military operation against the humanitarian flotilla and the Gaza blockade.\nCatherine Ashton\nVice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, this is an important debate on Gaza. We discussed the tragic events and their consequences during Monday's Foreign Affairs Council and I have been in permanent contact with the parties. This is an issue of great importance for the European Union, as is evident from the various resolutions that have been tabled.\nSo let me stress at the outset that what happened on the seas outside Gaza was unacceptable. We said so immediately, loud and clear. Nine people died in international waters under circumstances that demand an inquiry. This must be an inquiry that Israelis, Palestinians and, above all, the people of Turkey can believe in. Israel has announced the creation of an independent commission with the participation of two senior international members as observers. This is a step forward. But the EU will follow closely the conduct and the findings of the Commission before drawing further conclusions.\nThe military attack on the flotilla has captured the world's attention. The loss of life has been tragic. But we need to remind ourselves why the flotilla was heading for Gaza in the first place. That underlying cause is the terrible plight of Gaza, which is now back on peoples' radar. Honourable Members know I have seen it for myself: three months ago, when I was the first politician to enter Gaza from the Israeli side for more than a year. What I saw was shocking.\nLiving next to one of the most modern countries in the world, people carry goods by horse and cart. Israel rightly boasts an excellent ed", "15. Russia-EU Summit (vote) \n- Before the vote on Amendment 6:\nKonrad Szyma\u0144ski\nMr President, I wish to point out that Amendment 9, tabled by the PPE-DE Group, is not contradictory to my own Amendment 6 and therefore I should like to ask you to put both amendments to the vote separately.\n", "Novel foods (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Liotard, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on novel foods and amending Regulation (EC) No xxx/xxxx (common procedure) - C6-0027/2008 -.\nKartika Tamara Liotard\nrapporteur. - (NL) Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, as they helped me a great deal in improving the Commission report. I must also mention the cooperation with the Czech Presidency. They, too, had a good deal of positive input to offer and we were only a couple of small unresolved issues away from reaching an agreement at first reading, although it is, in any case, that bit more democratic to have a vote in the House first.\nWhen I first heard that the Commission was putting forward a proposal for a regulation on novel foods, I did wonder what was meant by 'novel foods'. I was also surprised that the Commission proposal took the internal market as its starting point.\nI will begin with that point. Like so many topics in this Parliament, this topic, too, can be approached from the perspective of the internal market, the producer or the economy. It can also be approached, however, from the point of view of food safety, consumers, health and the environment: in other words, on the basis of the welfare of the European citizen. In the EU, there is much talk about the environment and animal welfare and my thought was that this report should be more than just words: we should have action too. So when there was a choice to be made in my report on novel foods, in the first instance I opted for food safety, consumer welfare, the environment and animal welfare. I sincerely hope, and indeed the shadow rapporteurs have already informed me that it will be the case, that they support me on this point in the vote.\nInnovation is, of course, tremendously important. That brings me on to my second poin", "Welcome\nPresident\nI would like to welcome to the plenary chamber Maria Romana de Gasperi, the daughter of the great Italian statesman and one of the founders of the European Community, Alcide de Gasperi.\n(Applause)\n", "17. The basic salaries and allowances applicable to Europol staff (vote) \n- Before the vote on the draft legislative resolution:\nClaude Moraes \nrapporteur. - Mr President, according to our rules, after a rejection of a legislative proposal, it should be referred back to committee. The aim of such a referral is to try and find an acceptable solution for Parliament. Unfortunately, in this specific case, a referral may be meaningless as the Council will not be able to change its position. At the same time, it is not the intention of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to impede the Council in taking its decision - as the committee can do according to the legal base in the Treaty.\nWhat we intend to do is to send our political message to the Council that Europol should be strengthened and founded on a sound legal base according to the EU Treaties in the same way that Eurojust is constituted. Given that this message is clearly stated in the legislative resolutions, may I propose that you put them directly to the vote with my recommendation to vote in favour.\n", "Presentation of the Court of Auditors' annual report - 2009 (debate) \nPresident\nThe first item is the presentation of the Court of Auditors' annual report for 2009.\nV\u00edtor Manuel da Silva Caldeira\nPresident of the Court of Auditors. - Mr President, it is an honour for me to be able to participate in the debate today on the European Court of Auditors' annual report on the implementation of the 2009 budget, which I have already presented to you and to the Committee on Budgetary Control.\nI would like to present to the House the four key messages contained in this year's annual report. First, the Court concludes that the accounts of the European Union give a fair presentation, and a true and fair view, of the financial position and the result of operations and cash flows. This is the third consecutive year the Court has found the accounts to be free from material misstatements and reliable.\nAs regards legality and regularity, the Court gives an unqualified opinion on revenue and commitments, as in previous years. However, and this is the second key message of this year's annual report, payments from the budget continue to be materially affected by error, except in two areas. Those exceptions are administrative expenditure and economic and financial affairs.\nIn all other areas of expenditure, the Court found material levels of error. I will focus on the two main areas of expenditure: agriculture and cohesion.\nIn the area of agriculture and natural resources, the Court estimates the level of errors to be somewhat higher than in 2008. However, the results are consistent with the Court's assessment, in both years, that systems are only partially effective. The Court recommends reducing the risk of error by improving the quality of information in the databases used for establishing entitlements and calculating payments, and by clarifying and enforcing rules on land usage and maintenance.\nIn the area of cohesion, which represents almost a third of the budget, the situation rem", "Question Time (Council) \nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B7-0203/2009).\nThe following questions are addressed to the Council.\n\nSubject: Animal welfare\nGiven that animal welfare is one of the priorities of the Swedish Presidency, and given that countries such as Ireland have already put in place successful animal welfare schemes in relation to the live transportation of animals, including the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme which helps to ensure that our weanlings for export are stronger and better prepared to cope with the journey, has the Swedish Presidency any plans to take into account schemes such as these for the live export of animals in order to ensure that a balance is reached between the sustainable export of live animals and the safeguarding of animal welfare in any new legislation? Furthermore, given that Ireland is an island nation and relies heavily on the export trade of weanlings, has the Swedish Presidency any proposals that would inhibit this vital trade for Ireland?\nCecilia Malmstr\u00f6m\nMadam President, I have the honour of answering a question from Mrs Harkin. The Council shares the Member of Parliament's concern regarding animal welfare. The Commission's regular tabling of proposals has resulted in the continual establishment of a fair amount of Community legislation in this area. The Swedish Presidency aims to maintain the debate on animal welfare and good animal husbandry. These are priority issues for our Presidency in the area of agriculture and a special conference on animal welfare will be held in the Swedish city of Uppsala on 8-9 October.\nThe conference will be based on the results of the EU-financed project on Welfare Quality. Since 2004, the project has produced a scientifically based system to assess how well livestock is cared for in farming. The project is also investigating the best ways to provide feedback to farmers, consumers and other stakeholders. More than 40 institutions and universities from the EU and Latin America took p", "The European Union's Generalised System of Preferences (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the European Union's generalised system of preferences.\nPeter Mandelson\nMember of the Commission. Mr President, I am happy to share with you further reflections on the GSP+ scheme and the philosophy behind it. It is an important EU development tool: it contributes to economic progress in developing countries and the reduction of poverty, while taking on board the enduring need for promoting core human and labour rights, as well as sustainable development and governance principles.\nOne of the key priorities of EU trade policy is to be consistent with and to consolidate the objectives of development policy, in particular the promotion of sustainable development and good governance. This goal has been given greater prominence in the GSP+ scheme, which aims at encouraging developing countries to comply with international standards relating to social rights, environmental protection and governance, including the fight against drugs.\nIt is worth recalling that the criteria on which the granting of GSP+ is based are objective and transparent and have been made public in the regulation itself - this is in line with our WTO obligations. The success of the GSP+ scheme is that it provides an incentive for the applicant countries to ratify key ILO conventions in order to comply with the criteria of the GSP+.\nIt has played an instrumental role in the case of El Salvador, which deposited the ratification instruments of the missing ILO conventions on 6 September 2006. The ILO supervisory committees reported that most of the GSP+ applicant countries have made substantial changes to their legal systems in order to comply fully with the rights enshrined in the ILO conventions, which was the precondition for being granted GSP+ trade preferences in the first place.\nThe GSP+ system is an instrument of encouragement and support. It cannot solve everything at once; its r", "10. EU protein deficit (\nMartin H\u00e4usling\nMadam President, ladies and gentlemen, this report examines how the 80% protein deficit in the European Union can be reduced by promoting the cultivation of protein crops in Europe. The point of the report is not to instigate a debate on the question of zero tolerance, Nor does it aim to make it easier to import genetically modified soya. I would therefore implore you to vote against paragraphs 3 and 9. These amendments would lend the report a completely different character. If these two items are accepted, I shall have to withdraw my name.\nMartin H\u00e4usling\n(DE) Madam President, because the outcome of the vote has been to alter the report, I would ask you to have my name removed from the document. I wish to hand back the report.\n(Applause)\n", "The petitions process (amendment of Title VIII of the Rules of Procedure) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Onesta, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on revision of the Rules of Procedure with regard to the petitions process.\nG\u00e9rard Onesta\nMr President, after the large cake that was the Corbett report, I do not know whether this is the cherry; it is more like the little cake you get with your coffee, just as they slip you the bill.\nI am going to talk about petitions. We have seen in the past that the Rules of Procedure, as they stand, have caused us a few problems, as sometimes certain rules were difficult to interpret or even led to political deadlock as to the admissibility of this or that text. We have therefore tried to do some tidying up, to clarify and to consolidate, but that does not make it a revolution.\nFirst of all we want to better identify the petitioner, since, at the moment, when we receive half a tonne of petitions, it is not that clear who the contact person is. We will therefore ask the petitioners to specify who is, as it were, their leader; otherwise, we will decide to use the first name on the first page.\nWe have established the right to withdraw from a petition. We are saying to the citizens, 'you can submit a petition but you can also waive this right and request that your name be withdrawn from the list of signatories'.\nYou are aware that Parliament can receive correspondence in minority languages, such as Galician, Basque, Catalan and so on, when they are recognised by the Member States. We have decided to extend this right to petitions, too. If we receive correspondence in certain languages which the Bureau recognises as languages for written communication with citizens, we shall also reply in those languages.\nThe true reform, however, lies with admissibility. Until now, the members of the Committee on Petitions at times had to battle quite hard to find out whether a certain document really was a matt", "Proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights\nPresident\nMr President of the European Council, Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates, Mr President of the European Commission, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Dur\u00e3o Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure to welcome you here to the heart of European democracy, to the European Parliament, today on the occasion of the formal signing of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This is indeed a happy day, particularly for the citizens of the European Union.\nFifty years after the founding fathers created the European Communities out of the ruins of a shattered continent, our intention today is to proclaim solemnly the common values that form the core of our European identity.\nThe Charter of Fundamental Rights that we proclaim today symbolises the momentous journey towards a Union of the people of Europe which we have been making together over the past fifty years.\nThis Charter is proof that, when we laid the foundations of the European Union, we had learned the most important lesson from European history, and today we continue to regard respect for the dignity of each and every human being, preservation of the freedom that has been won and of peace and democracy and application of the rule of law as the driving forces of European unification.\nFreedom cannot develop without respect for the rights of others, and peace cannot flourish without fair accommodation of each other's interests. Freedom, peace, justice and social welfare are achievable only as an integral whole; none of these goals can be obtained at the expense of the others.\nThe founding fathers understood this and established Europe as a community based on the rule of law. The European Union is not governed by the concept that might is right but by the principle that power emanates from the law. Therein lies the true modernity and vision of our Union, a community rooted in shared values. Only true justice can guarantee peace for all of us.\nThis vision of the founding fathers ", "\n\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is the joint debate on the very important issue of Turkey, which includes the Council and Commission statements on the opening of negotiations with that country and the Recommendation by Mr Brok on the Additional Protocol to the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Economic Community and Turkey following the enlargement of the European Union [9617/2005 COM(2005)0191 C6-0194/2005 2005/0091(AVC)] (A6-0241/2005). \nDouglas Alexander,\n\u00a0\u00a0 . Mr President, honourable Members, I warmly welcome this debate, which is held at a critical time as the European Union prepares to open accession negotiations with Turkey.\nI have enjoyed my previous exchanges with honourable Members of this House on this topic, and the close and detailed interest that this Parliament maintains in both Turkey's accession process and enlargement issues more generally has further been demonstrated by the questions tabled for Question Time later this evening.\nThe December 2004 European Council decision to open accession negotiations brought Turkey's 40-year goal of European Union membership a significant step closer and in the process helped further to bind the country so critical to our future security, stability and prosperity to the Union. The strategic case for opening accession negotiations is convincing. It includes the powerful incentive for reform and the contribution the process makes to stability and prosperity, the example that it sets to the world that there is no contradiction between Islam and democracy, human rights and the protection of fundamental freedoms, and its contribution to reducing tension in the Aegean and over Cyprus.\nThe June European Council confirmed the December decision and recognised the importance for the European Union's credibility of observing our existing commitments. As Presidency, our task has been to deliver on these commitments and we are working hard to finalise the Council's position in the framework for negotia", "4. Euro-mediterranean relations (vote) \n- Before the vote on paragraph 21:\nPasqualina Napoletano\n(IT) Mr President, I believe that Mr Tannock has withdrawn his amendment in favour of an oral amendment which - I refer to paragraph 21 of the French text - would read as follows: after the phrase 'aucun cas refouler une personne', add 'demandeur d'asile vers un \u00e9tat o\u00f9 elle risque ...'.\nMr President, I would like to take the opportunity to call on my group to vote in favour of the final text because there was an error on the voting list.\nCharles Tannock\nMr President, I have not withdrawn the amendment that I submitted, but I would be prepared to do so in exchange for a change to that oral amendment adding words along the lines of 'for the duration within which the asylum seekers are having their cases considered by the authorities', because otherwise they could stay in our countries indefinitely.\n(Parliament rejected the oral amendments)\n", "2. Brazil: extradition of Cesare Battisti\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Brazil: extradition of Cesare Battisti.\nMara Bizzotto\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, in international law, a political refugee is a person who, owing to a fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality.\nCesare Battisti is not a political refugee. Regardless of the cover offered by France for many years, we are talking about a mass-murderer, who carried out or ordered four murders, and who hid behind the pretext of political struggle to evade a life sentence. It is disgraceful that a great country such as Brazil can deny the extradition of an unpunished criminal by granting him political refugee status. The Italian authorities and, above all, the relations of the victims, insist that this criminal is brought to justice.\nFaced with the arrogance of President Lula in denying extradition, the EU cannot leave the Italian Government by itself. Europe has, and must use, all the diplomatic instruments at its disposal to ensure that Mr Battisti is delivered to Italy, even at a cost of threatening to suspend cooperation agreements with Brazil.\nAnneli J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki\nMr President, respect for the independence of judicial powers and the legality of their decisions is one of the prerequisites for the rule of law and democratic society. Each person deserves the right to a fair trial and the judgment of an independent court of law should be respected.\nIn this case, the Brazilian Supreme Court decided to allow Battisti's extradition. The decisions taken in Italy to request extradition were all taken in the proper legal order. The European Court of Human Rights did not consider the appeal. In other words, this case is disposed of.\nNow, the Brazilian authorities must act to ensure that the law is applied and extradite Battisti. My group hopes th", "7. Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) (vote) \nTokia Sa\u00effi\nMr President, I shall read out the oral amendment: 'calls on the Commission to continue the negotiations on ACTA and limit them to the existing European intellectual property rights enforcement system against counterfeiting'.\n", "Agenda\nPresident\nMr David Martin's flight has been delayed. I would therefore ask the House to agree that his report on changes to the Rules of Procedure, which is very important for us, should be taken as the last item this evening. This is a change to the order of business rather than to the content of our session. It would be great if we could agree to this change because the rapporteur should be present during the debate.\nAs this is formally a change to the agenda, I am obliged to request the agreement of the House, and I hope that this agreement will be forthcoming.\n(Parliament accepted the proposal)\n", "Body scanners - Operation of intelligence services in the context of counter-terrorism strategies (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on combating terrorism and the statements by the Council and the Commission on body scanners and the operation of intelligence services in the context of counter-terrorism strategies.\nAlfredo P\u00e9rez Rubalcaba\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin this debate by thanking Parliament for the opportunity to hold a calm debate on counter-terrorism policy, and on certain elements of counter-terrorism policy in particular. I also applaud the timing of this debate, as a reasonable amount of time has elapsed since the worldwide commotion caused by the failed attack in Detroit in December of last year.\nOf course, when something like this happens, when it comes to tackling a threat such as the threat of terrorism, I believe in making a response, but I am much more in favour of working quietly and continuously, slowly but surely, as we say in my country. I would emphasise to the House that the threat of terrorism is still as real as it was in all of the EU countries.\nWe know that the terrorists observe us, we know that they are innovative and try to change their methods to evade our strategies in the fight against terrorism. Our strategy also needs to be innovative and varied because of this; it needs to improve and, most importantly, we must learn from our mistakes, since we certainly do make mistakes.\nThis being said, we are all aware that if there had not been a failed attack in Detroit in December, we would probably not be debating this issue in the terms that we are in this House. In other words, this debate is born from the need for precautions, and especially for conclusions, which we have all drawn from examining the success in Detroit that I just mentioned.\nAt the core of today's debate is also an analysis of where we failed in dealing with the alleged attack, and the measures that different countries", "Opening of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the 2000-2001 session of the European Parliament.\n\nAgenda\nLannoye\nMr President, the second item on this morning' s agenda is the recommendation for second reading on cocoa and chocolate products, for which I am the rapporteur. Quite by accident I learnt yesterday, at 8.30 p.m., that the vote was to take place at noon today. It was however initially scheduled, I thought, for noon tomorrow. I have therefore been caught completely off guard by this, and have not even had the chance to draw up the lists of votes and to see whether there are any roll-calls or not.\nYou know as well as I do that this matter is quite controversial and well reported in the media. I have been a Member of this Parliament for ten years and I have always been given notice, in my capacity as rapporteur, of any changes to the order of voting. I should prefer for this vote to be held tomorrow. It would suit me, personally, and I do not think anyone would have any objection, since it is a relatively brief vote.\n\nSwoboda\nMr President, we do not have anything against postponing the vote. However, I insist on the other scheduled votes, particularly those on the Lisbon Summit, going ahead tomorrow. We have nothing against postponement, with this proviso.\n\nPresident\nThe competent services have informed me that tomorrow' s list of subjects will be rather lengthy.\n\nBlokland\nMr President, like Mr Lannoye, late last night I too was faced with the fact that the vote on my report at second reading is planned for 12.00 p.m. The groups have emphatically asked me to urge you not to let the vote take place at 12.00 p.m. but tomorrow instead, as they have not had the chance to apply for split and roll-call votes. After all, it came as a complete surprise that the vote was planned for 12.00 p.m. I would therefore ask, also on behalf of many others, to postpone the vote until tomorrow.\n\nPresident\nMr Blokland, the officials of the competent services have informed me t", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nHowitt\nMr President, concerning the list of petitions appended to the Minutes, I wish to comment on Petiton No 727/95 by Mr James Fielding and others which concerns the position of 10, 000 elderly people in the UK who have lost money and risk losing their homes under failed home-income plans. They mortgaged their homes on the basis of false promises.\nWith regard to this petition, the Commission promised to send information about further European legislation to protect the rights of consumers with regard to financial services. That information has not yet been received. I would ask you to ensure that it is sent, Mr President.\nI would ask my colleagues on the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, the Social Affairs Committee and the Consumer Protection Committee to support the position of the pensioners affected when the new legislation is introduced. Finally, I would thank Mr Newman and colleagues on the Committee on Petitions for the support and sympathy they gave to the pensioners.\n\nPresident\nYou really should be grateful to me, Mr Howitt, that I let you say all that, because it had nothing to do with the Minutes!\n\n(Parliament approved the Minutes)\n\nDecision on urgency\nPresident\nI would point out that the report by Mr Kittelmann on this proposal, which is due to be discussed this evening by the Committee on External Economic Relations, is already on the agenda for Friday's sitting, marked 'possibly' . For the sake of procedure, however, we shall take this vote. Does the committee responsible wish to state its views?\n\nDe Clercq\nMr President, the Committee on External Economic Relations recommends that urgency be approved. There is widespread agreement on the basic issue, I think. I have one small remark to make, however. Once again, we have seen just how far the Council of Ministers' consultation of Parliament falls short of the mark. The Commissio", "Protection of pedestrians and other vulnerable road users (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Francesco Ferrari, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of pedestrians and other vulnerable road users - C6-0331/2007 -.\nG\u00fcnter Verheugen\nVice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, according to the statistics before the Commission, more than 8 000 people are killed each year on the roads in the European Union and 300 000 are injured. This is an intolerable situation and that is the reason why we have spent the last few years working hard to ensure greater safety on the roads.\nSeveral years ago, the European Parliament accepted a proposal for a Directive relating to the protection of pedestrians, which was then adopted in 2003. This was one of the first regulations in the world that related specifically to pedestrian protection. This legislation required manufacturers to ensure that new vehicles were less dangerous to pedestrians and to prove this in relevant tests. Since then, due not least to pressure from the European Parliament, legal provisions have been issued to counteract the hazard to road users by frontal protection systems on motor vehicles. The existing legal provisions on pedestrian protection acknowledge that, in certain circumstances, it can be difficult to fulfil the requirements laid down in them.\nThe Commission has taken on the task of examining the extent to which it is possible to satisfy these requirements and the possibility of using new, active safety systems. The Commission has commissioned a study, the results of which you are aware, and this study confirms the assumption that, indeed, not all of the requirements can be met and that, on the other hand, active security systems are suited to improving pedestrian protection. Based on this information, the Commission has presented the proposal t", "A Maritime Policy for the EU\nPresident\nThe next item is a debate on the Commission's communication relating to a maritime policy for the European Union.\nJoe Borg\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, today is a noteworthy day. Exactly 500 years ago the German cartographer Martin Waldseem\u00fcller created his striking single vision of a brave new world in which Europe was linked to Africa, Asia and the Americas by its oceans and seas. 10 October also marks the day when the King of Portugal mandated Bartolomeu Dias to seek a trade route leading to Asia, and in the United States Columbus's discovery of the New World is celebrated today. It is therefore a day worth recalling in the maritime world.\nFor my part, I am proud to come here today to this Parliament to talk about a new and exciting maritime future for Europe. This is a future that builds on the strong maritime heritage that Europe has inherited from the past, yet which also looks strategically forward to determine how Europe's well-being and prosperity, so closely dependent on the oceans and seas, can be enhanced.\nInspired by our own distinct vision of the oceans and seas, the Commission earlier today proposed an integrated maritime policy for the Union. For the first time in its 50 years of existence, the European Union has explicitly recognised that an integrated approach is needed for the seas and the oceans. This radical departure has its origins in the compelling argument that there is a maritime dimension to virtually every major issue facing Europe today - energy, climate change, innovation, international competitiveness, job creation, environmental protection, trade, transport and so on. Whichever sector one looks at, one can see strong links that run between them and the maritime sector. It would be unwise, indeed short-sighted, for the European Union to operate in these policy areas without taking account of their overlap with maritime affairs. What we need is a single vision where policymaking can be", "1. Internal market in electricity (\n- Before the vote:\nEluned Morgan\nrapporteur. - Mr President, this report is the first in a package of measures dealing with the energy markets in the EU. There has been a great deal of cooperation between all the rapporteurs and the shadows on this package and we would like to send a message to the Council that we intend to negotiate this as a package, not as a series of individual reports.\nThere is one aspect of the Electricity Directive which has caused a great deal of division within the Parliament. This is, unusually, broken down on a national basis, not on a party political basis. I would urge colleagues, however, to consider the report as a whole. It includes tackling energy poverty, better rights for consumers and measures to make the market work better.\n- Before the vote on Amendment 169:\nAnni Podimata\n(EL) Mr President, let me request, under Rule 150(5) of the Rules of Procedure, that the amendment be kept on the voting list, since it has been supported by 40 Members.\nPresident\nYou would be perfectly right if the amendment had not lapsed as a result of the previous vote. You could have moved it yourself but as it lapsed because of the previous vote, unfortunately you cannot table it yourself.\n", "1. Malaysia: the practice of caning (\nCristian Dan Preda\n(RO) Mr President, before we proceed to the vote, I would like to request on behalf of my group that when we vote on the situation of Eritrean refugees, we abandon the roll call vote for a joint resolution and request a roll call vote for the resolution proposed by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats).\nPresident\nYou have heard your fellow Member's request. If there are no objections, we shall proceed as suggested. I see no objections.\n", "Proposals on energy and climate change (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission, on the proposals on energy and climate change.\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso\nPresident of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all I apologise for the slight delay. As you know, we have just concluded our Commission meeting, and the first thing we did immediately after it was to come here to present what we believe is an historic package for the European Union. That is the reason why I, together with the Commissioner for the Environment, Mr Dimas, and the Commissioner for Energy, Mr Piebalgs, have only just arrived. The final drafting of the document is being completed. We will have it immediately, but this is a very important occasion to present to you first-hand the conclusions of our meeting today.\nI should like to start by saying that we are very happy with the result. The result was obtained by consensus in the College, with strong backing from all the Members of the Commission for a very ambitious proposal, because we have agreed what is now the most comprehensive package in terms of climate action and renewable energy that exists in any part of the world. We believe we have reason to be proud of it. This package on climate action and renewable energy meets the challenges of the future. We believe it is good for our planet; it is good for the European economy; it is good for our citizens.\nThe work of the European Union is sometimes seen as rather technical: interesting to specialists, but not relevant to people's daily lives. The action we are discussing today proves this theory wrong: the struggle against climate change and the quest for secure, sustainable and competitive energy touches every European every day. We are all affected by this, and this is one of the most - if not the most - important challenge of the 21st century.\nEuropeans ask for a vision and a plan of action. That is what we are doing now. This vision wa", "Protection of groundwater against pollution and deterioration (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Kla\u00df on behalf of the Parliament and Council delegation to the Conciliation Committee on the protection of groundwater against pollution\n(PE-CONS 3658/2006 - C6-8209;0382/2006 -.\nChrista Kla\u00df \nrapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, Members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the environment is a broad field; all human life on our continent is dependent on both air and water, and groundwater is among the most important and most vulnerable resources that we humans possess. It recovers lost quantity only very slowly, and regains its original state only very slowly after pollution; cleaning polluted groundwater can be done, if at all, only at enormous expense and with recourse to enormous technical resources.\nOur experience with air is currently teaching us that all the measures we have taken over the past decade have proved insufficient to prevent climate change and all its deleterious side-effects. Where air is concerned, we in Europe can accomplish relatively little unless other industrial states around the world lend a hand. Where groundwater is concerned, here in Europe, we alone have the power to secure this precious good for future generations, and in that the precautions we take and the protection of the groundwater ecosystem are of the utmost importance.\nThis has been my core concern, the thing for which I, as rapporteur, have fought, and I am grateful to all those who have supported me in this, by which I mean primarily you, the Members of this House, for, without your convincing votes at first and second reading, we would not have been able to achieve the result that we did in the conciliation negotiations with the Council, even though we had the Commission's support. I would like to thank the Council and the representatives of the Commission for their constructive cooperation and for their support in the quest for compromises.\n", "Activities of the European Ombudsman (2001) Deliberations of the Committee on Petitions 2001-2002\nPresident.\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following reports:\nthe report (A5-0267/2002) by Mr Wyn, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the annual report on the activities of the European Ombudsman for the year 2001 [C5-0296/2002 - 2002/2086(COS)], and\nthe report (A5-0271/2002) by Mr Koukiadis, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions during the parliamentary year 2001-2002 [2002/2019(INI)].\nMr S\u00f6derman, the European Ombudsman, has the floor.\n\nS\u00f6derman\nMadam President, on 1 September 1995 the Ombudsman's office started work. From then until 15 September 2002, the office received 10 535 complaints, of which 10 437 have been examined.\nWe carried out 1 385 full inquiries of which 19 were own-initiative inquiries. 1 149 of these cases involved the Commission, 137 cases involved the European Parliament's administration, 53 concerned the Council and 12 concerned the European Investment Bank.\nLooking at the results, 345 cases were settled by the institution concerned, after the Ombudsman had informed it of the complaint.\nIn 206 cases a critical remark was made, in 48 cases the inquiry resulted in a draft accommodation or proposal for a friendly solution, most of it achieved a success for the complainant.\nIn six cases a special report was made to the European Parliament, in four of these cases Parliament upheld the Ombudsman's recommendations, and two other cases are still pending.\nIn 659 cases, a thorough inquiry resulted in the Ombudsman finding that there was no maladministration in the activities of the institution.\nWhen cases are outside the Ombudsman's mandate, we always try to advise the complainant of another body that could deal with the matter.

Along with many other Members present here today, I remember his sterling work on Parliament's Committee on Social Affairs. This was just one of the ways in which he expressed his strong commitment to social and trade union affairs which led him to become a Member of this House.\nMany of us will also recall the special interest he took in matters concerning premises as a member of the specialist group of Parliament's Bureau.\nHe gave his all to the House for many years. In accordance with our tradition, therefore, I feel it is appropriate to ask you to observe a minute's silence in memory of our colleague.\nParliament observed a minute's silence\n\nApproval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of the sitting of Friday, 16 April 1999 have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nMaes\n) Mr President, as we begin this part-session, I wish to protest at the fact that I was not allowed to organise a seminar on the peace process in the Basque country to which all parties which signed the Lizzara declaration were invited. I and all those invited were banished to the visitors' centre. I think the President of Parliament, who did everything possible to keep this seminar from being held on our premises, has not acted as a president of Parliament here, but as a party-political ally of Mr Aznar, and I deplore that.\n\nPresident\nMrs Maes, a room was made available for you to meet with the people you decided to invite. It was a visitors' room, and this arrangement was made precisely because you anticipated a large number of visitors and had informed our services accordingly. All that happened was that the usual arrangements for meetings of this nature were made. Nobody prevented you from meeting together, and you did in fac", "Common rules for the internal market in electricity - Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators - Access to the network: cross-border exchanges in electricity - Internal market in natural gas - Conditions for access to the natural gas transmission networks - Fuel efficiency: labelling of tyres - The energy performance of buildings (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following items:\nthe recommendation for second reading by Mrs Morgan, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and repealing Directive 2003/54/EC (14539/2/2008 - C6-0024/2009 -;\nthe recommendation for second reading by Mr Chichester, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing an Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (14541/1/2008 - C6-0020/2009 -;\nthe recommendation for second reading by Mr Vidal-Quadras, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the Council common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003 (14546/2/2008 - C6-0022/2009 -;\nthe recommendation for second reading by Mr Mussa, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the Council common position with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas and repealing Directive 2003/55/EC (14540/2/2008 - C6-0021/2009 -;\nthe recommendation for second reading by Mr Paparizov, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the Council common position", "3. Free trade agreement between the EU and the Republic of Korea (\nRobert Sturdy\nrapporteur. - Mr President, I know everybody wants to rush off, but I just want to thank the Commission and the shadow rapporteurs on this.\nThis is a ground-breaking free trade agreement, which is outstanding. Parliament has a huge opportunity to support it and to put forward wonderful ideas for the future.\nPresident\nI put this fantastic agreement to the vote. It is a roll-call vote. It is carried. Congratulations to Mr Sturdy.\n", "An agenda for new skills and jobs (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the agenda for new skills and jobs.\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Andor\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, today, there are 23 million unemployed people across the European Union, corresponding to an unemployment rate of about 10%.\nThis situation emerged as a consequence of the financial and economic crisis and we have to face dramatic consequences, but this situation did not deter the European Commission from proposing ambitious objectives in the Europe 2020 strategy, and the European Union has set ambitious targets to meet in the not too distant future.\nWe have a headline target for an employment rate of 75% for men and women by 2020, and today, the Commission adopted yet another flagship initiative under the Europe 2020 strategy: an 'agenda for new skills and jobs' outlining how we intend to make progress towards full employment.\nIt is complementary to the flagship 'Youth on the move' adopted in September. Both should contribute to reach our 2020 employment and education targets. Yes, the crisis has wiped out millions of jobs. Yes, we face increasing international competition, but that is no excuse to shy away from taking action.\nOn the contrary, it is a call to act and shape our future. Creating more and better jobs is in our hands. Employment policy is largely a Member State responsibility but, as EU policy makers, we in the Commission, together with the European Parliament and the social partners, must do our bit. We must enable everyone who can work to actually do so. We need to allow the workforce to generate new ideas and set up new businesses. We need to ensure that the younger generation can benefit from the social model we have developed. We need better job quality and working conditions for all employees. An agenda for new skills and jobs sets out action in four areas: functioning of labour markets; skills; job quality and working conditions; and job creation.\nThe agenda ", "\nPresident\nBefore we start with the order of business, there are still a number of points of order.\n\nBethell\nMr President, with regret I have to inform the House of the arrest yesterday in Moscow of Vladimir Alexandrovich Gusinsky, chief executive of the Most-Media group of television, radio and newspaper outlets.\nMr Gusinsky is a leading Russian community leader, being chairman of the Russian Jewish Congress and deputy chairman of the World Jewish Congress. This morning he is in what is known as a general purpose cell in Butyrsky prison where conditions are such that they must be left to your imagination. Mr Gusinsky's media activities were the only ones permitted to criticise Mr Putin and his government. His independent television is the only one that questions the behaviour of Russian troops in Chechnya. His programme Dolls, based on Britain's Spitting Image, satirises the President, something which supposedly causes him great irritation. His radio station Moscow Echo was selected by President Clinton a few days ago for the only substantive interview that he gave to a Russian outlet.\nOn 11 May Mr Gusinsky's places of work were raided by so-called tax police - men in ski masks and camouflage outfits carrying Kalashnikov rifles. There are few Russians who do not see a connection between Gusinsky's criticisms and the heavy-handed treatment now being meted out to him. Now we have this arrest and Mr Putin says he knows nothing about it.\nThis latest event leaves Russia teetering on the brink. Either Mr Putin backs down and releases Mr Gusinsky, or we shall have to conclude that Russia's brave attempt to establish a free press has turned out a failure and their democracy an illusion. The consequences of this will be devastating. It will mean goodbye Council of Europe, goodbye Partnership for Peace, farewell Tacis and a warm welcome to a new arms race. The European Parliament must do what it can to avert this catastrophe. I ask you, Mr President, to confer with your coll", "Community legal framework for a European Research Infrastructure (ERI) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Riera Madurell, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the Community legal framework for a European Research Infrastructure (ERI) - C6-0306/2008 -.\nTeresa Riera Madurell\nMr President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to point out that unanimity was achieved in the ITRE Committee regarding this report. Unanimity was possible thanks to the good work and cooperation of the shadow rapporteurs, whose contributions also largely helped to achieve a useful report on a subject as important as the European research infrastructure.\nI must say that Parliament agrees with the Commission that, in view of the globalisation of research and the emergence of new scientific and technological powers such as China and India, we urgently need to speed up, and, to that end, incentivise, the construction of a new European research area.\nIt is very important that we ensure as soon as possible that the European Union is an area in which researchers, technologies and knowledge can move freely, where there is effective coordination of research activities and where the best possible use is made of resources. This requires, amongst other things, that we have large research infrastructures at the European level.\nThese infrastructures can also provide an excellent opportunity for cooperation between the different Member States, with significant effects on the scientific education of our young people and a strong economic impact on European industry. They are therefore essential to the progress of science in Europe and consequently, we must facilitate their development. Parliament therefore applauds the Commission's initiative in proposing a legal framework and the conditions for it.\nIn fact, from the beginning, we considered the development of European research infrastructures to be one of the pillars ", "The transposition, implementation and enforcement of Directives 2005/29/EC and 2006/114/EC (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Weiler, on behalf of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the transposition, implementation and enforcement of Directive 2005/29/EC, concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market, and Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising.\nBarbara Weiler\nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before I come to my report, I would like to say once more that we have not conducted ourselves correctly with our decision to debate our own-initiative reports. When I see how the debates proceed - without dialogue, without controversy, without conflicts - I do not feel this to be a proper parliamentary debate and I hope we will put that right quickly after the European elections.\nNevertheless, I would like to express my thanks to fellow Members who are not present. We have worked very well together on the production of the report. I would also like to thank the Commission and the committee secretariat.\nWe have made many new joint discoveries during the debate in committee. The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has consciously put the debate on implementation relatively early on the agenda because the deadline for implementation by Member States was the middle to the end of 2007, which to date is not much time for a directive involving an enormous and significant element of harmonisation. Nevertheless, some Member States have not undertaken transposal. Certainly, this has to do with the complicated procedure, but it is interesting that three Member States who have not managed it are some of the founding Member States. Therefore, we cannot assume that they are lacking in knowledge of European law. Three Member States have not yet transposed the directive, four have done so deficiently and inadeq", "1. Regulations governing political parties at European level and the rules regarding their funding (vote) \n- Leinen report\n- Before the vote:\nJo Leinen  \nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, last Friday, the Council accepted the essential content of this Regulation on the funding of parties and foundations at European level. In addition, this morning, a trialogue took place with the Commission and the Council, and we reached agreement on the questions that remained to be settled. Therefore, there is a realistic chance of adopting this project at first reading and creating the prerequisites for better financing even for 2008.\nI therefore suggest that we postpone the vote until 29 November, at the next plenary, in Brussels.\n(Parliament approved the proposal)\n", "\n(1) \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is the Commission statement on Asian bird flu. \nByrne,\n\u00a0\u00a0 . Mr President, avian influenza has affected poultry populations in nine countries in Asia so far, namely Cambodia, the People's Republic of China, including the special administrative region of Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Pakistan, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam.\nAccording to an FAO-WHO-OIE expert panel held on 3 and 4 February in Rome, the current epidemic is still evolving and not yet under control. As of today, the disease has taken 18 human lives in Vietnam and Thailand, but a new virus, fully transmissible to humans and capable of spreading from human to human, has not yet emerged.\nIn total Asia has around 40% of the world's poultry population and accounts for 25% of world trade in poultry. There are 6664 million birds in the affected areas. Already the situation is affecting the world's grain and meat markets.\nThis is a devastating disease in poultry causing very high mortality \u2013 up to 95% in 24 hours. Many millions of birds have already died of the disease, or have been destroyed in the fight to halt its spread.\nIn its sanitary and its economic dimension, not forgetting the animal welfare aspects, this outbreak of avian influenza is unprecedented and, although there is at present no indication of a developing human pandemic, this risk cannot be excluded according to the WHO.\nThe disease impact is likely to be most felt by smallholders and owners of backyard flocks which form their main food supply. It may be more difficult to prevent the disease in these flocks than in larger commercial units. This has the potential to accelerate trends towards the industrialisation of poultry operations in the affected countries and therefore could have some negative social and environmental consequences.\nClearly, the situation affects the European Community at many levels and the Commission, as well as the Member States, has taken decisive action. The Commission has immedi", "Temporary workers (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Council common position (10599/2/2008 - C6-0327/2008 - for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on temporary agency work (Rapporteur: Mr D\u00e9sir).\nHarlem D\u00e9sir\nrapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen - I hope that the Council Presidency is going to join us - it has now been more than six years since the adoption of the Directive on temporary work was postponed, not because of Parliament, which gave its opinion as soon as the Commission's proposal was referred to it in 2002, but precisely because of the deadlock of certain Member States within the Council.\nWe have the opportunity today, after the adoption of a common position between the Member States, to arrive at this important piece of social legislation at a time when expectations of a social Europe are high, and it is this opportunity that we must seize. Temporary work accounts for more than three million jobs in the Union. Temporary workers are employed by around 20 000 companies, which represent a turnover of EUR 75 billion.\nThis is a sector that is obviously very liable to fluctuations in growth, and temporary workers are today the first to be affected by the economic slowdown and the rise in unemployment. However, like other types of insecure and atypical employment, temporary work has seen structural growth over the last few years, and this development was estimated at almost 60% over the last five years. It is a development that has continued with particular intensity within the new Member States.\nTemporary work concerns a very large number of sectors that vary according to the Member State: industry, in some countries, services, in others, and construction, agriculture and transport, in others still. Its proportion also varies a great deal from one country to another. It may be as much as 5%", "Question Time (Council) \nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B6-0010/2008).\nThe following questions are addressed to the Council.\nSubject: Immigration in the wake of the EU-Africa summit\nCan the Council provide information on the measures proposed for adoption in order to implement the agreements reached at the recent summit held in Lisbon between the EU and the countries of Africa on the subject of immigration?\nJanez Lenar\u010di\u010d\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - It was agreed at the EU-Africa summit held on 9 December last year in Lisbon to establish a strategic partnership which would encompass all areas and issues of mutual interest.\nI would especially like to draw your attention to three important documents which were adopted at that summit: the Lisbon Declaration, the EU-Africa Joint Strategy and its First Action Plan. This First Action Plan of the Joint Strategy establishes a partnership between Africa and the European Union in the supplementary fields of migration, mobility and employment.\nThe partnership between Africa and the European Union in the areas of migration, mobility and employment should ensure comprehensive responses to these issues with the specific aim of creating more and better jobs for Africans and better control of migration.\nAt the moment, the competent bodies of the Council are studying further measures that will need to be undertaken on the basis of the decisions of the Lisbon summit and on the basis of the EU-Africa Joint Strategy and its First Action Plan, including the partnership in the area of migration.\nManuel Medina Ortega\n(ES) Madam President, the question is: what type of measures can be taken effectively, because the migratory pressure on Europe is still very high, as a result of the distressing social and economic situation in many African countries.\nThe specific question that I wanted to ask was whether, in fact, the Council currently has any concrete plan, because time is marching on, the situation in Africa is not im", "Order of business\nPresident\nThe final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 15 May 2008, pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.\nHartmut Nassauer\n(DE) Mr President, once a year - in May, for some inexplicable reason - it is customary for all the committees to meet in Strasbourg. There appears to be no logical justification for this. As a result, we have committees meeting this evening at the same time as subjects within their sphere of responsibility are on the plenary agenda.\nThis is an untenable situation. The only possible solution, really, is that the committees meet in Strasbourg in future and that we move the plenary sittings to Brussels to resolve the conflict! Seriously, though, committees meetings here in Strasbourg cannot continue to clash with plenary sittings and group meetings to the extent that this has been happening, especially over the last two years and in spite of all the declarations that such clashes were to be avoided. Now we even have a cooling-off period. There is no practical reason whatsoever why committee meetings here in Strasbourg need to clash with plenary activities. I should be grateful if you would do everything in your power to put matters right.\n(Applause)\nPresident\nThank you very much, Mr Nassauer. I shall apprise the Conference of Presidents of the situation you have described, and I am confident we shall find a satisfactory solution.\nThe following amendments to the agenda have been proposed:\nMonday:\nNo amendments.\nTuesday:\nThe Socialist Group has requested the addition to the agenda for Tuesday of a Commission statement on the situation of the Roma in Italy without motions for resolutions.\nMartin Schulz\non behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to clarify the nature of our motion.

Mr Klepsch spent most of his professional life working towards a united Europe. He was a Member of this House for over two decades, or, in other words, nearly five parliamentary terms. I would like to ask you for a minute's silence in memory of Mr Klepsch.\n(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)\nI would also like to inform you that there is a book of condolence available where you may write your messages of condolence.\n", "Evaluation of the Australia-EU PNR agreement - EU PNR (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on:\nthe report by Mrs in't Veld, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs concerning the conclusion of an agreement between the European Union and Australia on the processing and transfer of EU-sourced passenger name record data (PNR) by air carriers to the Australian customs service and\nthe oral question - (B6-0476/2008) to the Commission concerning the European Union and PNR data by Mrs in't Veld, Mrs Roure, Mr Bradbourn, and Mrs Kaufmann on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.\nSophia in 't Veld\nrapporteur. - Mr President, I will start with another remark on the absence of the Council, because in my speaking notes I had some remarks about good cooperation between the European Parliament and the Council, dialogue, spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon etc., but the Council is absent for this debate as well. I think that is absolutely disgraceful, because it is the Council that is hammering out a PNR policy and is required to reply to questions, and it is not here. The Council has publicly made solemn pledges to involve the European Parliament, but now we see what the pledges of the Council are worth - nothing. I think this is an affront not to the European Parliament but to the citizens who are entitled to answers and transparent decision-making. So please, Mr President, pass on my discontent to the representatives of the presidency.\nIt is a joint debate on, the one hand, the proposals for an EU PNR and, on the other hand, the agreement on PNR between the EU and Australia. They are essentially the same problems, and the problems have already been raised in the context of the agreement with the US and, later on, with Canada.\nOne of the main issues is that of purpose limitation, because everything else follows on from that - purpose limitation or, in other words, the justification for the proposal to begi", "The situation of women in the Balkans (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is a brief presentation of the report by Mrs Gurmai, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on the situation of women in the Balkans.\nZita Gurmai\nCommissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for staying to listen at this late hour. I am very pleased to be able to present this motion to you today. I am pleased, because it shows that the European Parliament considers monitoring and improving the situation of women in the Balkans to be important. I am convinced that this is our common interest and responsibility, since the European Union cannot close itself off.\nWe all know that the countries of the region have been through serious traumas, and not that long ago. They are making very great efforts to address their problems, and for this they deserve admiration. It is my opinion, however, that they fail to take a very important resource into due consideration, namely women.\nIt is true that women suffered particularly heavily during the wars, but we must bear in mind that they are not solely victims, but play a constructive, active, useful and indispensable part in democratic stabilisation and reconstruction.\nI was never in favour of making exceptions for women, but I am so bold as to declare that they should be given the same opportunities as men. No more and no less. It is no different in this case either. Women can fulfil the above-mentioned role only if they are given the opportunity to do so.\nAnd what is this opportunity? Since women constitute half the population, they must be given a decision-making role in the same proportion. I know that according to many people, a quota is not the true solution, but I must say that unfortunately a more effective administrative solution has not yet been found.\nThe economic emancipation of women is one of the first tasks. Working women are more productive members of society and are less subjugated. And if they are worki", "1. Burma: continued detention of political prisoners\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution on Burma.\nMikel Irujo Amezaga\nauthor. - (ES) Mr President, as I was saying, according to the Campaign for Human Rights, Peace and Democracy in Burma, on 12 March, the oldest Burmese political prisoner spent her 78th birthday in solitary confinement at Insein prison.\nThis is U Win Tin, an eminent journalist and leader of the National League for Democracy. U Win Tin is the oldest prisoner of conscience in Burma. She has spent the last 19 years in prison, since July 1989.\nShe was sentenced to three terms of 21 years imprisonment. We only know about her current situation because of the latest report on the conditions of Burmese prisoners by Yozo Yokota, Special United Nations Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Burma.\nU Win Tin has refused to renounce her political ideals in exchange for her freedom. She was taken into hospital for a second hernia operation in January 2008.\nShe is one of Burma's 1 873 political prisoners. Obviously, in this resolution, we also want to express our condemnation of the extension of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's house arrest.\nMy group demands immediate measures to begin an urgent and necessary process of political and economic reform. First, release of all political prisoners. Second, the restoration of basic civil liberties and, obviously, a political dialogue between all parties.\nWe also reiterate our request to the Council to adopt vigorous measures against the Burmese Military Junta, which has become world leader in human rights violations.\nMarios Matsakis\nauthor. - Mr President, numerous resolutions have been passed by this House condemning Burma's military junta for the severe breaches it has committed repeatedly against the human rights of the Burmese people.

Instead, they continue their firm hold on power in a most disgustingly pompous and", "\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, some Members of the House did not hear me yesterday speaking about the terrible floods which occurred in the departments of south-west France. I did actually do this, I said how affected we were by this tragedy and I added that, of course, we are going to ask the Commission to take appropriate action, both to provide assistance for the victims of these disasters and also to add to the arrangements set in place by the government concerned.

Situation in Iran (vote) \n- Before the vote\nJos\u00e9 Ignacio Salafranca S\u00e1nchez-Neyra\n(ES) Mr President, I would just like to say that my Group supports the groups that put forward the motion for a joint resolution and will endorse it.\n- Before the vote on paragraph 6\nVytautas Landsbergis\nMr President, I am sorry my amendments are being moved in this special way because of technical problems. I ask for support in replacing one word. So 'potential military use' would become 'potential military link'.\n(The oral amendment was accepted.)\n- Before the vote on paragraph 9\nVytautas Landsbergis\nMr President, it is again very simple. The insertion of one word: 'sincere cooperation'.\n(The oral amendment was not accepted.)\n- Before the vote on Amendment 9\nPaulo Casaca\nMr President, I regret to announce to the House that Mr Zamel Bawi, whose execution we asked to be stopped, was executed at 4 a.m. yesterday in Karoon prison in Ahwaz. Therefore I am moving an oral amendment to Mr Salafranca S\u00e1nchez-Neyra's existing amendment, on which I hope to obtain his agreement. The oral amendment relates to this execution and states that one of the inmates on death row is actually a European citizen, who was kidnapped from Syria. The other two are UNHCR refugees who had already obtained asylum in Norway.\nThe oral amendment reads as follows: 'Protests vehemently against the execution in Iran on 30 January 2008 at 4 a.m. local time of the Ahwazi activist Zamel Bawi, the 19th Ahwazi activist executed in the last 12 months, and urges the Iranian government to desist from executing the Dutch citizen and human-rights activist Faleh Abdulah al-Mansouri and the UNHCR-registered refugees Rasoul Ali Mazrea and Said Saki, whose resettlement to Norway has been secured, as well as to allow them to proceed to their countries of citizenship or refuge'.

The political significance of this report therefore derives from the fact that this is the first time that the Commission and Parliament have examined this activity, at a time when it is recording accelerated growth both in volume and in economic importance.\nThe numbers speak for themselves: in business aviation alone, small and medium-sized enterprises working in this field are multiplying, the number of aircraft is expected to double to 3 500 in the next decade and annual turnover amounts to more than EUR 25 billion. Directly or indirectly, it generates 154 000 jobs across Europe. Together with general aviation, where it is calculated that there are between 30 000 and 50 000 aircraft, the sector represents around 9% of all recorded air traffic and boasts the fastest growth in Europe, twice as high as that of all other traffic.\nThe business aviation segment offers important social and economic benefits: by providing flexible point-to-point transportation it increases citizens' mobility, companies' productivity and regional cohesion.\nThe general aviation sector provides essential services in very diverse areas, from search-and-rescue aviation to firefighting, traffic regulation, cartography and leisure and sports aviation. It is also an important source of professional skills for the entire aviation sector.\nI must also mention European industry in this sector, which has been showing continuous growth in its world market share, which currently hovers around 16% and which it is therefore necessary to support.\nLooking at the report itself, I agree, as rapporteur, with the need ", "EU-US air transport agreement - EU-Canada air transport agreement - EU-Vietnam air services agreement (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on:\nthe recommendation by Mr Zasada, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the draft decision by Council and the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of the European Union, meeting within the Council on the conclusion of the Protocol to Amend the Air Transport Agreement between the United States of America, of the one part, and the European Community and its Member States, of the other part (15381/2010 - C7-0385/2010 - 2010/0112(NLE)),\nthe recommendation by Mrs Tic\u0103u, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the draft decision of the Council and of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of the European Union, meeting within the Council on the conclusion of the Agreement on Air Transport between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and Canada, of the other part (15380/2010 - C7-0386/2010 - 2009/0018(NLE)), and\nthe recommendation by Mr Riquet, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam on certain aspects of air services (14876/2010 - C7-0366/2010 - 2007/0082(NLE)).\nArtur Zasada\nMadam President, the Protocol which will be put to the vote is a particularly important document. The aviation markets of the European Union and the United States, taken together, account for around 60% of world air traffic. Opening the market to airlines from the European Union and the United States on a non-discriminatory basis will offer passengers and freight operators improved services, provide substantial economic benefits and create jobs. My dream is for passengers to benefit from competition between airlines on the basis of market principles, for passengers flying in transit to th", "Common Immigration Policy for Europe: Principles, actions and tools (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is a short presentation of the report by Mr Busuttil, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on a Common Immigration Policy for Europe: Principles, actions and tools (2008/2331)(INI)).\nSimon Busuttil\nIf I had to sum up my report in two lines I would say, firstly, the European Parliament is strongly in favour of a common policy on immigration, and secondly, that Parliament does not want a fragmented immigration policy anymore. Rather, it wants a coherent one, because only a coherent policy can be effective.\nI say this now with stronger conviction, in light of the recent case that took place these past few days, which saw the ship Pinar save 154 immigrants found in international seas. This case highlights the need for a common policy. In fact, this underscores the price that we are being forced to pay because of the lack of a sound common policy. What price? The price being that everyone shrugs off their responsibility and places it on the shoulders of others, and while we are busy pointing fingers at each other, there are people who are drowning and dying every day in front of our very eyes.\nIt is a disgrace that a country of a population 60 million uses its laws in an attempt at brushing off its responsibility onto a country with a population of less than half a million. I augur that this was simply an isolated case, and that the Italian minister from the Lega Nord was playing to his audience a few weeks before the European Parliament elections. These political gimmicks are easy to spot but this does not make them acceptable. I would like to laud the constructive spirit that the Maltese and Italian Prime Ministers favoured when they intervened to solve the Pinar situation. Thanks to their intervention, reason triumphed over dramatic antics. Common sense prevailed over intransigence and respect for the law reigned over th", "5. Extension of scope of regulation on the professional cross-border transportation of euro cash by road between euro area Member States (\nSophie Auconie\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur, and on behalf of the political groups that are in agreement, I call for the vote on the two reports on the transport of funds to be postponed. I am referring to the report that we are discussing now and to report, which is the fifth item to be voted on after this one.\nThis postponement is justified on procedural grounds and is designed to ensure the best possible collaboration with the Commission and the Council. I therefore invite you all to vote in favour of postponing the vote on this report and the one that follows five items later.\nPresident\nI will now ask for two statements. I will ask for a statement from one person who would like to support the proposal. Mrs Bowles, you have the floor.\nSharon Bowles\nChair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - Mr President, I would like to clarify that the committee has asked for this to be deferred because we have been the subject of a procedural violation. A recital that was agreed in a written trialogue procedure - and about which there can therefore be no doubt - was removed in the Coreper (Committee of Permanent Representatives) text. We have also been told that the Commission Legal Services will not agree to a text that is not wholly in accord with the common understanding, even though the common understanding is not legally binding.\nWe cannot accept this unilateral change as a precedent in any way, and therefore we will not vote until the matter is resolved. We cannot allow the interinstitutional agreements, or common understandings or anything else, to restrict the power of this Parliament that has been conferred on us by the Treaty, and therefore this text cannot be allowed to proceed. Before we go ahead, we will also need to have a clear understanding that this cannot be repeated.\nFrancesco Enrico Sp", "Welcome\nPresident\nI would like to inform you of the presence in the official gallery of a delegation from the Syrian Parliament, led by Mr Numair Ghanem, President of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, who is on his third visit to the European Parliament.\n(Applause)\nWelcome, Mr Ghanem!\nI would like to stress the importance of your visit. Your country, Syria, plays a very important role in the Middle East and your visit is of particular significance given the current situation in that region.\nFurthermore, Syria is the only country in the Euro-Mediterranean region with which we have yet to sign an association agreement, despite the fact that the negotiations have been completed.\nI am convinced that your contacts with the European Parliament will strengthen the parliamentary dialogue and that the talks that you will hold will mark a new stage in the strengthening of relations between the Syrian people and the European Union.\nWe welcome you and wish you a positive visit, Mr Ghanem and delegation.\n", "Parliament's new role and responsibilities in implementing the Lisbon Treaty - Institutional balance of the European Union - Relations between the European Parliament and national parliaments under the Treaty of Lisbon - Financial aspects of the Lisbon Treaty - Implementation of the citizens' initiative (debate) \nPresident\nWe are going to resume the sitting with a very important subject: the joint debate on the Treaty of Lisbon, which includes the following reports:\nthe report by Mr Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on Parliament's new role and responsibilities in implementing the Treaty of Lisbon,\nthe report by Mr Dehaene, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the impact of the Treaty of Lisbon on the development of the institutional balance of the European Union,\nthe report by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the development of the relations between the European Parliament and national parliaments under the Treaty of Lisbon,\nthe report by Mrs Guy-Quint, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the financial aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon, and\nthe report by Mrs Kaufmann, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, requesting the Commission to submit a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the implementation of the citizens' initiative.\nAs you can see, these are five extremely important reports dealing with an issue that is highly topical, and we should also bear in mind the fact that, as you know, the senate of the Czech Republic has approved the ratification of the Treaty by the majority required.\nJo Leinen\nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, the final evening sitting of this legislative period is devoted to the debate on the Treaty of Lisbon. We know that many evening sittings have preceded this one in our effort to bring about a Reform Treaty and its ratification in 26 parliaments of the Member States", "Revision of the framework directive on waste (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the recommendation for second reading by Caroline Jackson, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on waste and repealing certain Directives (11406/4/2007 - C6-0056/2008 -.\nCaroline Jackson\nrapporteur. - Madam President, following your ruling that there is no time for points of order, I will continue with my speech on the Waste Framework Directive. It is a little difficult to do so against this background, but I will persevere.\nSince certain comments have been made on this point in the British press recently, may I begin by drawing attention once again to my declaration of interests, which I made on the record, and which cites my membership of the Environmental Advisory Board of Shanks plc. That company operates a wide range of waste technologies in Britain and on the continent, and the primary purpose of its Environmental Advisory Board is to provide independent audits of the operation of its plants.\nMy fellow board members include the chairman of the EU Scientific Advisory Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks and a member of the Green Alliance.\nLike many Members, I value the opportunity this kind of experience has given me to learn at close hand about the issues and problems facing this industry and those who work in it.\nTurning to the Directive, it has been a long and tortuous road to this second reading and I congratulate those of my colleagues who have accompanied me on it to the very end. The issue is a very important one. Various judgments in the Court of Justice regarding the status of waste destined for treatment in energy-from-waste plants needed to be clarified. New definitions were needed. Two existing directives on hazardous waste and on waste oils were repealed and their provisions transferred to the Waste Framework", "Welcome\nPresident\nI would now like to welcome a delegation from the Swiss Federal Assembly to the official gallery. The Swiss delegation is headed by Mrs Brigitta Gadient.\n(Applause)\nIt is a pleasure for me to welcome you all to the European Parliament in Strasbourg where you have been taking part in the 27th EU-Switzerland interparliamentary meeting yesterday and today.\nI know there have been some interesting discussions on developments and the current state of play, and future challenges for the relations between Switzerland and the EU, with special emphasis on the EU-Swiss dialogue on tax issues, free movement of persons and the experiences from the latest EU enlargements, cross-border service provision and the Schengen-Dublin agreements, Swiss financial contributions to the EU enlargement, and free trade in agricultural products.\nThere is a long relationship between our parliaments - almost three decades - and it has led to the development of a profound knowledge both on the EU side and the Swiss side. I am sure that the exchange of views that has taken place this week will enhance our parliamentary cooperation.\n(Applause)\n", "7. Officially supported export credits (\nHelmut Scholz\non behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, I would like to announce that the GUE/NGL Group wishes to withdraw the roll-call vote on both parts of amendment 10.\nYannick Jadot\nMr President, as in the previous vote, the shadow rapporteurs and myself have decided not to put the legislative resolution to the vote in Parliament so as to continue negotiations with the Council, in the hope that it will heed Parliament's vote today.\n", "GM/Opel: current developments (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on GM/Opel: current developments.\nVladim\u00edr \u0160pidla\nMadam President, honourable Members, the present debate concerns a question of great interest to the European public: the public financing of the restructuring of the Opel/Vauxhall group by one or more European governments.\nThe Commission has monitored this question closely. On 14 July 2009, Commissioner Kroes and I raised the case of the Opel/Vauxhall group with you here in the European Parliament. The Commission has also organised several informal meetings with the European ministers responsible for this matter.\nAs you know, in autumn 2009, General Motors decided to keep hold of Opel/Vauxhall and to restructure the company. At the end of November 2009, General Motors presented a summary of its restructuring plan to the services responsible for competition.\nAlthough the role of the Commission does not usually involve prior assessment of the industrial and commercial rationale behind a restructuring case, in the absence of information from the Member States on potential State aid for the plan, the Commission's services undertook such an assessment at the request of the Competitiveness Council.\nOn the basis of the content of the General Motors restructuring plan and of the information supplied to the Commission, it would appear that this restructuring plan is not based on non-economic considerations, which would damage the future viability of the Opel/Vauxhall group's European operations.\nThe current General Motors plan shares a number of characteristics with other restructuring plans prepared previously by General Motors itself and by other interested investors, and does so in certain key areas. It is consistent with earlier General Motors decisions taken before the start of the crisis, in particular, on the issue of allocating a particular model to a particular production site.\nMoreover, General Motors has given an economic j", "US subpoenas and EU data protection rules (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on US subpoenas and EU data protection rules.\nEnik\u0151 Gy\u0151ri\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, Parliament is representing the concerns of many European citizens as it pays increased attention to US authorities requesting data from media communications companies after WikiLeaks' leaking of American state secrets. The Council naturally shares Parliament's concerns about respect for EU data protection rules. However, it is not in the possession of information from which it could determine whether the US court procedure was in violation of EU data protection laws. As regards the case of WikiLeaks, as referred to by several Members, the United States Attorney General has publicly admitted that there is an ongoing criminal investigation. As far as I know, US attorneys urged, in connection with this investigation, that an American court order Twitter to hand over specific data in a ruling, and the court did adopt the relevant ruling.\nIt is not the task of the Council to comment upon how the US judicial authorities take their decisions. Additionally, it does not even possess information on the basis of which it could question the validity of a reasoned court ruling. There have been court proceedings in the United States where Twitter was able to defend its own position. This is also proven by the fact that the American court upheld Twitter's request to inform its clients about the court ruling. The European Union generally respects the court proceedings of third countries. It is self-evident that when investigating a suspected criminal offence, prosecution authorities must obtain information. It is also a well-known fact that the US procedure for obtaining information differs from that followed by the majority of EU Member States. The main difference lies in that it has a wider scope, meaning th", "Equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Riera Madurell, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on transposition and application of Directive 2002/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 23 September 2002, amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions.\nTeresa Riera Madurell\nrapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, the directive referred to in the report is an amended version of a 1978 directive on the same subject, prepared in the light of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the case-law developed by the Court of Justice of the European Communities and the new social realities. It is a version that incorporates key elements of the improvement in women's rights, which are those assessed in this report.\nThe legal text presents the definition of direct and indirect discrimination, assault and sexual assault; it requires Member States to encourage employers to adopt measures that prevent all forms of gender discrimination; and it safeguards workers' rights following maternity or paternity leave.\nBy implementing this Directive, the Member States not only commit themselves to establishing equality bodies that promote, assess, implement and support equal treatment, but also undertake to instigate social dialogue, with the aim of promoting equal treatment in the workplace through collective agreements, in a planned manner. They also commit to strengthening the role of NGOs in promoting equality, to establishing effective measures to penalise those who do not abide by the provisions of the directive, and to implementing protective measures for those who provide support to victims.\nIf the Commission had been able to draw up the report which, accord", "\n\nChichester (PPE-DE ).\n\u00a0\u00a0  Mr President, as chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I should like it confirmed \u2013 for the record \u2013 that all the letters of assessment on the Commissioners\u2013designate have been forwarded to Mr Barroso, President\u2013designate of the Commission. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Mr Chichester, I note your request. You will certainly be given an appropriate confirmation. \nMart\u00ednez Mart\u00ednez (PSE ).\n\u00a0\u00a0  Mr President, last Sunday, speaking to my country\u2019s top newspaper, Mrs\u00a0Loyola de Palacio stated that Spain was losing weight in the European Union and becoming an appendage of France and Germany.\nWe have said in this House over recent days that everybody has the right to think and express their opinions, whatever they may be, but when that opinion clashes with the responsibilities of a Vice-President of the Commission, calling into question three States of the Union, we believe that is very serious.\nSince we believe it to be an insult to my country, Spain, and probably to two other countries of the Union, I would call on the Vice-President of the Commission for a specific rectification and on acting-President Prodi to intervene. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Mr Mart\u00ednez, as you yourself have mentioned, the predominant responsibility for reacting to this issue lies with Mr Prodi and the Commission and I have no doubt that appropriate reactions will be given, in accordance with the political sensibilities of those primarily involved. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is oral question B6-0019/04 by Mrs Z\u00e1borsk\u00e1, on behalf of the Committee on Women\u2019s Rights and Gender Equality, to the Commission, on women and poverty. \nZ\u00e1borsk\u00e1 (PPE-DE )\n\u00a0\u00a0 , .  Mr President, Madam Commissioner, on Sunday 17 October the international community observed the International Day for the Elimination of Poverty, in order to draw attention to poverty as a\u00a0violation of human rights.\nWe are endeavouring to eliminate poverty, but, if we are to succeed in this, society must redouble its efforts. ", "Zero tolerance regime for unauthorised GMOs and the economic consequences thereof (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Neil Parish, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the zero tolerance regime for unauthorised GMOs and the economic consequences thereof - B6-0151/2008).\nStruan Stevenson\ndeputising for the author. - Madam President, I should first of all thank my colleague Mr Parish, Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, very much indeed for giving me the opportunity of coming here at this late hour to ask this oral question. He, unfortunately, has for many months had a longstanding arrangement to go to Denmark with Commissioner Fischer Boel and had to leave for Copenhagen this afternoon. So he sends his apologies for his absence and also sends his greatest respects to Ms Vassiliou and welcomes her to the Commission.\nThis is a reality check. We have a very competitive and successful poultry and pig industry in the EU. They are completely unsupported. They do not receive a single farm payment; they do not receive any subsidy at all and they have to stand alone in the marketplace.\nWith poultry and pigs the biggest cost of production is the feed. Pigs and chickens do not graze the fields and therefore everything they eat is cereal-based. If you have an unsupported industry you must make sure that they have access to competitive feed from around the world.\nIn Europe we take over two years on average to license a perfectly safe GM product. Herculex, one of the few approved GM seeds, took 33 months to achieve EU approval. In the US the average approval time is half that: 15 months.\nThere is no excuse for this. With food prices and costs for the poultry and pig industry both rising, we cannot afford this time delay in licensing feed. We have got to speed things up.\nIn the US many of these GM products are by-products from the bioethanol industry and they are significantly cheaper", "Camp Achraf (written declaration) \nPresident\nWritten declaration No 0075/2010, presented by Alejo Vidal-Quadras, Stephen Hughes, Kristiina Ojuland, S\u00f8ren Bo S\u00f8ndergaard and Struan Stevenson, on Camp Ashraf, has been signed by more than a majority of Parliament's component Members.\nTherefore, pursuant to Rule 123 of the Rules of Procedure, it will be forwarded to its addressees and published, together with the names of its signatories, in the texts adopted for this part-session.\nStruan Stevenson\nMr President, I, too, would like to thank all the Members who signed Written Declaration No 75 on Camp Ashraf. This sends a very powerful message to the Iraqi authorities to lift the inhuman siege that they have applied against the 3 400 innocent people in Camp Ashraf over recent months. I really am grateful that more than half of the Members of this House have signed this declaration. It was only opened a month ago and that is a very rapid victory. Thank you very much indeed.\n(Applause)\n", "Democratic process in Turkey (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on democratic process in Turkey.\nOlli Rehn\nMember of the Commission. - Madam President, I am afraid we may have the same passion in this discussion on democracy in Turkey as we had on the wine reform during the second half of Arsenal v Manchester United, which is a snapshot of Europe in 2009.\nThis is more serious, because this is a very serious matter and indeed a very substantive issue concerning democratic development in Turkey. First of all I am deeply saddened and shocked by the massacre that took place in Bilge in Turkey last night, killing 44 people. I offer my sincere condolences to the families and friends of the victims and I trust that the murderers will be brought to justice as soon as possible. There is no moral or ethical justification of this kind of horrible attack.\nLet me also express my personal, and the Commission's, sorrow on the death of nine Turkish soldiers and a gendarme as a consequence of the terrorist attacks last week. Our thoughts are with the families of those who lost their lives.\nWe condemn terrorism and support Turkey in its fight against terrorism. The PKK is on the EU list of terrorist organisations. Between 14 and 18 April more than 200 officials and members of the Democratic Society Party have been arrested in a police operation throughout Turkey, and in particular in its south-eastern region.\nWe understand that charges brought against them include being a member of a terrorist organisation, although a formal indictment is still pending. We expect to see the indictment finalised as part of a transparent and objective judicial process.\nThe Commission cannot interfere in ongoing legal cases. However, our approach is clear: while we support the fight against terrorism, we have consistently stressed that it must be conducted by respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular as regards the freedom of expression and association.\nP", "2. Electronic communications networks and services (\nRebecca Harms\non behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, I have asked for the floor because I do not agree with the voting order on the Trautmann report. I request that I be given the floor before the vote on Compromise Amendment 10 to explain why the voting order should be changed.\nRebecca Harms\non behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, I should like to request that the voting sequence be changed and that Compromise Amendment 10 be put to the vote after we have voted on a number of other identical requests by various Groups that were due to be voted on after Amendment 10.\nMy reason for this is that, in my opinion, the amendments proposed by the various Groups go far beyond the Compromise Amendment regarding the item 'Protection of citizens' rights against intervention in Internet access or capping of Internet access'. I believe that it would be a good thing for Parliament, which so clearly declared its support for the infamous Bono/Cohn-Bendit Amendment, to speak out once again in support of the highest protection of citizens' rights.\nI regret that, at the end of a very good consultation with Mrs Trautmann I am unable to request this, but this friendly consultation, the good result of the telecoms package, should not ultimately mean that we curtail citizens' rights en passant.\n(Applause)\nAlexander Alvaro\non behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Madam President, on the basis of Rule 154 and Rule 155(2) of the Rules of Procedure, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe would like to endorse the request by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to change the voting order of the amendments and to put Amendments 1 c, p, 2, 5, 6 and 9 to the vote before Compromise Amendment 10.

Reducing the administrative burden resulting from EU regulations is one of the most effective ways in which we can improve the regulatory environment for Europe's 24 million businesses. This initiative therefore makes an important contribution towards achieving our ambitious targets as part of the partnership for 'Growth and Jobs'.\nThe Commission therefore welcomes Parliament's support for a rapid adoption of this urgent procedure. This will help eliminate those unnecessary elements of the documentation required when transporting goods across national borders within the EU. The measure in question will remove those regulations which have now become obsolete and which in fact date back to the year 1960.\nAccording to the regulations still in force carriers are required to provide a wide range of information on tariffs, price agreements and transport arrangements as soon as the goods they are transporting cross national borders within the Community. The simplified system being proposed by the Commission will significantly ease the administrative burden on some 300 000 European haulage companies and it has been estimated that it will save these operators a total of at least EUR 160 million a year: not a bad result", "One-minute speeches on matters of political importance\nPresident\nThe next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.\nEmmanouil Angelakas\n(EL) Mr President, there has recently been a growing clamour within the EU for the expansion of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, above all to meet Europe's energy demands.\nThe problem is the unchecked rise in the price of oil, the increasing demand from a number of countries with rapidly growing economies, regional disturbances in oil-producing countries, as well as the fact that renewable sources of energy or natural gas will cover a mere fraction of Europe's energy needs. As a result, the construction of nuclear plants is being tabled for discussion.\nMany questions worry European citizens. Can the safe operation of nuclear power plants be guaranteed? Do appropriate early warning systems exist to guarantee sufficient notice in the event of an operational problem? Finally, how safe is the management of nuclear waste? For all these reasons, I believe that on the initiative of the European Parliament and with the collaboration of the Commission, a dialogue could usefully be conducted leading to clear, unambiguous conclusions for European citizens. I call on the French Presidency to make this issue a real priority in its agenda.\nMarusya Ivanova Lyubcheva\n(BG) Mr. President, Dear colleagues, I would like to draw your attention to an issues that makes us responsible for the future of the European Union and the world at large.

(ES) Madam President, yesterday, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, of which I am chairman, did indeed hold an extraordinary meeting to deal with this matter and it was agreed to refuse urgent procedure, and for two basic reasons: firstly, because the urgent procedure is not authorised to be applied on one day for the next; in the meeting, neither the Commission nor the Council presented good enough arguments; and, secondly, because I believe we must demand of the Council that it justify urgent procedure and, also, not to treat Parliament as a mere formality, even though it has to be said that, in this case, the content of the proposal also reflects the opinion of Parliament. In any case, this matter will be dealt with next Monday in our committee's ordinary session.\nPresident.\nIf no one else wishes to take the floor, we shall vote on this request for urgent procedure.\nWe shall now proceed to the vote on the request for urgent procedure.\n(The decision was made not to apply urgent procedure.)\nPresident.\n The next item is a report (A5-0021/2003) by Mrs Malliori, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a Council recommendation on the prevention and reduc", "19.

The European agricultural sector wants to contribute more and more to the production of public goods through strict safety and quality, environmental protection and animal welfare standards. It is therefore only logical that imported agricultural products should provide the same guarantees. In the course of negotiations at the WTO, the EU has, for a long time, been - and to a certain extent still is - on the defensive as regards agriculture. However, observations need to be made in relation to certain misconceptions, which fail to take into account how radically the CAP has been revised. The EU has already drastically reduced its trade-distorting aid, unlike key trading partners. It has also unilaterally made a substantial reduction in export refunds, whereas some competing trading partners are continuing to make considerable use of other forms of export incentives. The EU is the largest importer of agricultural goods from developing countries in the world. The EU has already made an extremely generous offer on agriculture, but this has not, to date, been reciprocated by an equal level of ambition from other developed and advanced developing countries. At the same time, the Commission is conducting bilateral and inter-regional negotiations with numerous trading partners. The impact on European agriculture of all the individual concessions, alongside outstanding agricultural negotiations, is giving us particular cause for concern. Within this framework, Commissioner, we call on the Commission to defend the multifunctional role of EU agriculture ", "Situation in the Arab world and North Africa - Situation in Yemen - Situation in Syria (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the situation in the Arab world and North Africa, Syria and Yemen.\nCatherine Ashton\nVice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, the last time I spoke in this Parliament in early May, I said that statements should, and could, be made but that the priority was action.\nYou will remember that I announced my intention to establish a European Union office in Benghazi. The European Union flag now flies above the courthouse in the newly-named Freedom Square: a symbol not just of our solidarity with its people, but of our practical commitment.\nThe office is now up and running and experts are arriving each week, working to see how we can support the security needs of the people and build the capacity of civil society. Last week, my team was in New York, coordinating our work on Libya with the UN.\nOutside the courthouse in Freedom Square, I met some of the people who have been bringing democracy to life in Libya. They thanked me, they thanked you and they thanked the European Union. They know that we will stay with them over time. Today, I am sure you join me in saluting again the enormous courage of the Libyan people, whether in Benghazi, Misrata, the Western Mountains, Tripoli or in the South.\nWe have stepped up sanctions to stop arms and money reaching the regime. We have provided almost EUR 140 million of humanitarian assistance to those most in need. We continue to work for a political resolution to the conflict, in the Contact Group - which will meet in Istanbul this week - and in the Cairo Group, where, at our instigation, we continue to work with the UN Secretary General and the Special Envoy, Mr Al Khatib, the Arab League", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nDavid Sumberg\nMr President, I am grateful to you for calling me. I supported this report but, as I shall be leaving this Parliament in the coming elections, I want to use this as a final opportunity to underline the very powerful message that the President of the Czech Republic, the President-in-Office, recently gave to this Parliament: 'We now seek a new people's mandate'. The truth is, however, that the people are not really represented in this Chamber. As the President-in-Office said, there is no opposition here to the European project.\nThe people - the men and women in our constituencies, particularly in Britain - do not want a European Constitution, they do not want a treaty imposed on them. What they want is the right to vote and I hope, sooner rather than later, they will be given that opportunity.\nRichard Corbett\nMr President, I welcome the adoption of this report. My group and I voted in favour. This is a very important signal that Parliament has sent. We must now, however, follow it up.\nEwa Tomaszewska\n(PL) Mr President, the antisocial behaviour of employers is forcing employees to become self-employed, and this includes workers who are drivers and people who offer transport services. Employers want to save on social insurance costs and gain greater flexibility, but this has led to a situation where we have to vote under pressure from this antisocial behaviour.\nThis is why it was necessary to reject this report, because the scale of this antisocial behaviour is so great. Its existence threatens not only the occupational hygiene of workers, but above all it threatens the safety of road traffic, and can affect practically each one of us and the situation of everyone who is on the road, whether it be in a car or as a pedestrian. This is a very clear reason why we should deal very seriously with this problem and why we should come back to it, because the proposed solution did not provide us with a way out of this ", "3. Parliament's priorities for the UN Human Rights Council (Geneva, 1-26 March 2010) (\nJos\u00e9 Ignacio Salafranca S\u00e1nchez-Neyra\n(ES) Mr President, yesterday, during the debate on the motion for a resolution on which we are about to vote, we expressed our sorrow at the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo, a 42-year-old builder and Cuban political prisoner, who died after a hunger strike and many years of arbitrary, unjust, inhumane and cruel imprisonment.\nIn this House yesterday, Commissioner Georgieva strongly and forcefully condemned this event. I am calling on you, Mr President, on behalf of Parliament, to send your condolences to Mr Zapata's family, which is being harassed at his funeral.\nI would ask you to communicate to the Cuban authorities your strongest condemnation of this completely avoidable death, which the head of the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and Reconciliation, Elizardo S\u00e1nchez, described as a murder dressed up as justice. I hope, Mr President, that this death will lead to reflection among those who, out of good faith or naivety, want to change the Council's common position, an honourable position that merely serves to link any improvement in relations with the island to human rights and fundamental freedoms, which, as we have seen, continue to be violated.\n(Applause)\nElmar Brok\n(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I propose an oral amendment for a split vote on paragraph 10, concerning the following passage: 'considers that the inclusion of this concept in the Protocol on complementary standards on racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and all forms of discrimination is not appropriate'. A split vote must be held on this central part, because I do not understand why we are combining these things and not making it clear that we must combat discrimination against religious minorities just as vigorously as all other types of discrimination. It is not acceptable for the measures to combat discrimination against religious minorities to be less str", "\nSantini\nMadam President, I should like to put a point of order before Parliament today, at a time when we are about to vote on the most important act we are called upon to approve, that is, the budget. Nine people died yesterday in the St Gotthard tunnel because of a road accident. This places a greater onus on us when - under the heading of 'infrastructure' - we come to vote on the much-needed and now ever more pressing engineering works which must be Europe' s response to the problem of traffic across the Alpine passes.\nToday we shall be debating the reopening of the Mont Blanc tunnel, with all the economic and environmental problems that involves. Let us also remind ourselves of this: the incident in the St Gotthard tunnel was caused to a great extent by the additional volumes traffic that the St Gotthard, Brenner and other Alpine passes have had to absorb as a result of the closure of the Mont Blanc tunnel. We must therefore vote with conviction for the infrastructure funding to speed up the procedure involved in rebuilding the Brenner rail tunnel and the Fr\u00e9jus rail tunnel, and move road vehicles onto trains, with benefits for the safety of those who travel and also for the surrounding environment. Let us remember that when we vote.\n\nPresident\nOf course, Mr Santini.\n\nVOTE\nMaij-Weggen\nMadam President, I should like to table an oral amendment to Amendment No 192. The old text reads as follows - it is very short: \"And furthermore research projects making use of primates are also excluded.\" I would like to change that to: \"Financing of research projects making use of primates is suppressed within two years, unless it is proved that alternatives are not available.\" If this amendment can be adopted, it can be combined with 372. Then we will have a sound text. I have agreed this with Mrs Buitenweg.\n\nPlooij-van Gorsel\nMadam President, I am against this oral amendment.\n(With more than twelve Members standing, the oral amendment was not considered) Following the vote\n\nB", "\n\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Before moving on to the items on the agenda, I must inform you of something you already know. We will not have the opportunity to listen to President Mahmoud Abbas today.\nA few hours after arriving in Strasbourg yesterday, our guest today, President Mahmoud Abbas, had to return to Ramallah. This was of course due to the dreadful and deplorable events that took place in Jericho and which have created a violent and dangerous situation.\nLast night I informed him that Parliament understood perfectly well that the crisis created in Palestine obliged him to return to his country to take control of the situation.\nDestiny and fate have led to a highly symbolic situation. His having to leave Strasbourg having just arrived without being able to come to Parliament has something of the symbolism of Greek tragedy about it.\nMr Abbas represents the majority of Palestinians who still support a negotiated solution to the conflict with Israel despite all of the suffering and all of the disappointments they have been through. He represents those people who, despite everything, still believe that it is possible to find a solution by peaceful means.\nHe is a man who has been trying to achieve peace through negotiations since the seventies and his presence here amongst us today would therefore have been a golden opportunity to support his approach; another opportunity missed as a result of an unnecessary and illegal military operation and the violence that it has caused.\nThe whole world is now wondering why and how such a military operation can help to strengthen Israel's security, why and how the humiliating pictures we have seen on the television or the destruction of that prison by bulldozers can contribute to Israel's security. We Europeans will have to pay for a new prison, like so many other things destroyed during these tragic confrontations.\nThe violence that has followed this military action is extremely worrying. As you know, t", "16. Combating female genital mutilation in the EU (\n- Before the vote\nLissy Gr\u00f6ner\nMr President, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament would like to vote in favour of this alternative resolution. However, we would like to state that in recital G 'sexual and reproductive health' should not be seen as a step backwards in relation to decisions that have already been made. It is important to us that the sexual and reproductive rights of women are recognised.\n", "Resumption of the session\nPresident.\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 5 June 2003.\n\nPodest\u00e0 (PPE-DE).\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would point out that, yesterday, 17 June, was the twentieth anniversary of the arrest of Enzo Tortora. I expect that this name will not mean much to many of the Members, but it will certainly have great significance for the Italians. He was a very famous television personality, elected as a Member of the European Parliament to the ranks of the Radicals of Mr Pannella. He was fully acquitted, after many years of legal proceedings: he was the victim of judicial error and media persecution, of an abuse of media power. This is something which, I regret to say, still happens today in many countries. I would just like to pay tribute here to his civil campaigns and to Mr Tortora himself, so that his memory is not lost in this House too.\nBer\u00e8s (PSE).\nMr President, I have asked to speak on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists on a point of order in order to draw your attention to the situation of Vincent Reynaud, originally from Strasbourg in France, and Thierry Falise from Belgium. These two journalists and their interpreter have been secretly detained since 5 June in Vientiane in Laos. They have been accused by the Laotian police of cooperating with bandits in a professional capacity in relation to the murder of a Laotian security officer, while in actual fact they were preparing a report on a minority group living in the mountains. They are currently facing capital punishment.\nOn behalf of my group, I call on you, Mr President, to take immediate action to ensure that the Laotian authorities free the journalists, Vincent Reynaud and Thierry Falise, and that justice and truth prevail as we are very much concerned and emotions are running high.\nPresident.\nI am happy to do that.\n\nCohn-Bendit (Verts/ALE).\nMr President, on behalf of this Parliament, I would like to ask you to", "Explanations of vote\nWritten explanations of vote\nJean-Pierre Audy  \nI voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution approving the nomination of Mr Algirdas \u0160emeta as a member of the European Commission. I question, however, the legal aspects of this decision. Indeed, pursuant to Article 215(3) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which lays down the rules in the event of a commissioner resigning, it is the Council which, acting by qualified majority, appoints the substitute commissioner. As I see it, the European Parliament does not have any power in this particular case, and its Rules of Procedure, paragraph 2(2) of Annex XVII of which stipulates a vote by secret ballot, are not in line with the Treaty. This stipulation of the Rules of Procedure is certainly imperative for the European Parliament, but not for a properly appointed commissioner. Article 214(2) of the EC Treaty, curiously mentioned as the legal basis of the resolution, concerns not the nomination of a commissioner in the event of a resignation, but the vote to approve the entire Commission as a college. It is also strange to see this resolution adopted on the basis of Rule 106(4) of the Rules of Procedure, which concerns the election of the entire Commission and not the replacement of a commissioner.\nRare\u015f-Lucian Niculescu  \nI voted in favour of Mr \u0160emeta, whom I would like to congratulate on the appointment he has been given, and I wish him every success. However, I cannot but express my concern - yet again, because I have also done this in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development - about the suggestion made by him that part of the funds required to finance the European economic recovery plan should be obtained through reducing the funds earmarked for direct aid to the agricultural sector. I hope that this was just a simple misunderstanding and that such a measure, which would be impossible to accept, will not be implemented.\nJean-Pierre Audy  \nI voted in favour of th", "3. North Korea\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on seven motions for resolutions on North Korea.\nBastiaan Belder\nauthor. - (NL) Madam President, the repression of any potential criticism of the established order in North Korea is so strict that no information about any individual dissident or activist is in the public domain. This is the razor-sharp conclusion of an open letter of 14 June which five human rights organisations have addressed to the foreign ministers of the European Union. It is also a measure of how serious the situation is in Kim Jong Il's famished empire. We do not have the names of any dissidents or activists in the territory of North Korea. That information must be allowed to percolate through to us. The situation there is even incomparable with that in the former Soviet Union or Ceausescu's Romania.\nThe open letter of 14 June urges European government officials to do a great deal more in response to the relentless violations of the fundamental rights of North Korean citizens, both within and without the boundaries of their country. Various concrete recommendations to this effect may be found in Parliament's joint resolution. Well done! Let us, for instance, continue to remind China, at all European political levels, of its treaty responsibilities towards North Korean refugees.\nI also wholeheartedly support paragraph 14 of the resolution. The Commission is protecting the rights of North Korean workers in the Kaesong Industrial Complex by incorporating an unambiguous clause on this point in its Free Trade Agreement with South Korea.\nMadam President, officially North Korea claims that it guarantees religious freedom to its population of 24 million. In practice, however, anyone who is found distributing bibles or taking part in secret prayer meetings is liable to be sent off to a labour camp or even executed, according to the testimonies of refugees. At the beginning of this month we found out that Son Jong Nam was tortured to death in a North ", "Explanations of vote\nJan B\u0159ezina\n(CS) Madam President, the Czech Republic was among those initiating the submission of the draft Council Framework Decision on prevention and settlement of conflicts of exercise of jurisdiction in criminal proceedings, and this shows that the Czech Republic attaches considerable importance to judicial cooperation. In view of the sensitivity of the issue, however, it is necessary to ensure that this cooperation operates within the bounds of the authority vested in the European Union by the founding treaty. That is happening in this case. The weak point, on the other hand, is a relatively pronounced generality, for example, in the absence of deadlines for a response from a requested authority and the lack of criteria for determining the most suitable judicial authority for handling criminal proceedings. Another fly in the ointment is the poor integration with Eurojust, which should have been the focus of attention. As the body for European cooperation in judicial matters, there is, lying dormant, a far greater potential for Eurojust than the role it has in the draft framework decision, which does not even stipulate a requirement to inform Eurojust when resolving issues of criminal prosecution of cross-border crimes in a single Member State.\nPhilip Claeys\n(NL) Madam President, I voted against this report, but not because I oppose the exchange of information between national authorities on criminal proceedings. It is a good idea to find out whether there are parallel ongoing proceedings for the same facts in other Member States.\nWhat I do strongly oppose, however, is the federalist tone of various amendments. Take Amendment 3, for example, which explicitly denies each Member State the discretion to decide which authorities are competent to act. I am by no means opposed to Eurojust, but it must not turn into a 'super-institution'.\nZigmantas Bal\u010dytis\nMadam President, I voted for the resolution.

Ladies and gentlemen, 65 years ago today, in June 1940, three countries which are now members of the European Union \u2014 Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia \u2014 lost their independence as a result of the Soviet occupation. As a result of this and for half a century, the citizens of those countries were deprived of their human rights and suffered terror and deportations.\nToday our institution is remembering these events, which, together with others, are part of our history. This is not the first time that the European Parliament has talked about this, it is not the first time that this Parliament has remembered the past of these countries, which today are members of the European Union.\nIn 1983, 22 years ago now, this Parliament expressed its condemnation of the occupation of States by other States. And at these difficult times for the European Union, right now, we must remember that the accession of those Baltic states to the Union has contributed and will continue to contribute to promoting the objectives of freedom and prosperity for the citizens. Today we must express our pride in the fact that we can work together on the construction of a united Europe that shares common values.\nIt is important to remember this, it is important to remember that the construction of a better future for all Europeans is based on respect for human rights and requires constant attention and vigilance, because people who forget their history run the risk of repeating it. Thank you very much.\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 With the agreement of the political groups, I propose the following amendments to the order of business for the present part-session which appear in the corrigendum that has been distributed.\nThe rep", "\n(1) \nRandzio-Plath (PSE ).\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013 Mr President, on the way from the Chamber to a meeting of my group yesterday, I was pushed into a corner by a camera team, prevented from continuing on my way, and hurt my back in the process. I would ask you, as a matter of urgency, to ensure that Members can go about their business in this House without interference from representatives of the media. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 I will have the services look into that to ensure that we can go about our business as we ought to be able to in the House. \nKinnock, Glenys (PSE ).\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013 Mr President, as I am sure you are aware, next Wednesday the world will commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Rwandan genocide. Nearly one million people were slaughtered, and international intervention came only too late. Even now, we have to ask if there is the political will to put in place the measures likely to prevent future suffering on this scale.\nYou will, I know, agree that there must never be a 'next time', and I would therefore request that tomorrow we remember the events in Rwanda ten years ago and that we have a minute's silence in support of the need to never stand aside again. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 I take note of that for the opening of tomorrow's sitting, Mrs Kinnock. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is the joint debate on the European Council and security:\n- European Council report and Commission statement \u2013 European Council meeting (Brussels, 25-26 March 2004) and\n- Council and Commission statements \u2013 Security of citizens in Europe following the Madrid bombings. \nAhern, Bertie,\n\u00a0\u00a0  \u2013Mr President, President Prodi, I am very pleased to be here with you today to report on the outcome of last week\u2019s spring European Council.

As a matter of fact, better regulation aims at maximising the benefits of modern, rational and effective legislation, whilst minimising its costs, so that productivity, growth and ultimately employment can be ensured at the highest level throughout the European Union.\nThere is no doubt that better regulation is fundamental to ensuring a fair and competitive market place, citizens' welfare and the effective protection of public health and the environment. It is an important part of the Lisbon Strategy, as it can boost productivity and employment significantly. Better regulation is shared responsibility.

Yesterday, however, in connection with my report, a decision was taken which points in two directions. After we had already discussed the legal basis for this decision, and also raised appropriate objections to it, to which we received no response from the Commission, this House decided yesterday to agree to the Commission's legislative proposal and then passed a resolution rejecting the Commission's proposal. This is recorded under item 11 of the Minutes.\nI would now like to propose that the resolution passed by this Parliament yesterday be referred to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the purposes of clarification under Article 148(3). There are two specific reasons for this: Firstly, we need clarification as to which of the two resolutions in this instance is actually valid. Secondly, we need, for the future too, clarification in the Rules of Procedure as to what is to happen in cases such as this. For if, as appears to me, votes are being, as it were, immediately corrected by the authorities, I find that not exactly in order. I believe that a correction should in principle be made if the Committee on Constitutional Affairs so decides. I therefore base my objection on Article 148(3). I request this House's Committee on Constitutional Affairs to clarify the situation and set down a ruling in the Rules of Procedure as to how we should proceed in future cases of this sort.\n\nPresident\nMr Swoboda, I understand the reasons for your request. I think the President will need to think it over very carefully and assess whether or not to give it positive follow-up. I cannot give you an answer off the cuff. I feel it would be discourteous to say no, but it would also be too hasty on my part to give an answer right away.

The people of Southern Sudan have waited a long time for the chance to exercise their right of self-determination. The timely, peaceful and credible conduct of the referendum has been a remarkable success and one of which everyone should be proud.\nThe preliminary results of the referendum in the 10 southern states were announced on 30 January and showed an overwhelming majority (99.5%) in favour of secession. We still await the final results, which will be out in the next couple of weeks.\nWe congratulate the Southern Sudanese people for the determination, dignity and patience they showed in turning out to vote in such large numbers. We also commend the Southern parties to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement for their leadership, and the Sudanese Referendum Authorities for the remarkable job they did in organising the referendum despite the enormous challenges they faced.\nThis referendum's success is, above all, a Sudanese achievement but it also reflects the support of the African Union and the AU High-Level Implementation Panel led by President Mbeki, who helped the parties to move forward, as well as the sustained diplomatic attention it received from the international community, including the UN, the US and, of course, the European Union.\nSudan has been high on our political agend", "Quota system in relation to the production of potato starch (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Wojciechowski, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 establishing a quota system in relation to the production of potato starch C6-0046/2007.\nMariann Fischer Boel\nMember of the Commission. Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Wojciechowski, and members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for the work that has been carried out on this report.\nI shall start by placing this proposal in its context. Since the potato starch production quotas were introduced back in 1995, we have been trying to define a strategy that could secure, enhance and promote the development of this important sector. However, over the last decade the European Union's agricultural policies have changed dramatically, becoming more market-oriented with the decoupling of most aid payments, and reforms of the market organisations in almost all sectors.\nIn spite of the existence of quotas, potato starch production exceeds demand on the European market with the result that we have to export about 40% of our production into the world market, usually with the benefit of export refunds. Concerning the proposals that we are discussing today, it is of vital importance to preserve the stability of this very fragile sector while at the same time taking the fundamental changes due to the reform of the common agricultural policy into account.\nThe main objectives of the proposals are firstly to roll over the quotas for another two years, which will allow us to review the potato starch system in the framework of the health check. An extension of four years, as you propose in your report, would not allow us to take the opportunity to go into details with this important sector in the health check, and therefore you will understand that we cannot accept this amendment", "Announcement by the President\nPresident\n At the Conference of Presidents' meeting on 31 January 2002 it was decided to alter the duration of the adjournment of the session. I should like to inform you that pursuant to Rule 10(4) a plenary sitting will be held in Brussels on Wednesday, 20 March 2002. The purpose of that sitting will be to hear the outcome of the Barcelona Summit meeting. It will be addressed by the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Aznar.\n\nEIB Annual Report for 2000\nPresident\n The next item is the report (A5-0392/2001) by Olle Schmidt, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the EIB Annual Report for 2000 (C5-0541/2001 - 2001/2218(COS)).\n\nSchmidt, Olle\nMr President, Mr Maystadt, I should like to thank you, Mr Maystadt, very much for the kindness and readiness to help which you and your colleagues have shown to me and the committee. It made the work considerably easier. I also wish to thank my colleagues.\nThe role of the EIB has been of topical interest in the debate in recent years, and criticisms have been made. These have mainly been targeted at deficiencies when it comes to environmental issues, openness and transparency. The EIB has understood the criticism, and significant changes have taken place. For this, you, Mr Maystadt, and your colleagues deserve our recognition.\nThe analysis for the year is in many respects a follow-up to the sterling work carried out a year ago by Mr Lipietz. A number of the views put forward at that time are being repeated now. As is well known, the most important issue for the EU is enlargement. This involves a fundamental change constituting a major challenge both for the candidate countries and the current Member States.\nToday, most EIB loans go to different types of regional development project within the EU. That is certainly fully compatible with Statutes of the EIB, but future enlargement makes it necessary to reconsider this distribution of resources. There must be an increase in th", "5. Community system against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (\n- Before the vote:\nMarie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Aubert\nrapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the fisheries sector is experiencing a serious crisis at present, not just because of the increase in the price of diesel, for which sustainable, global proposals must be put forward and not just temporary solutions, but also because of the poor management of fisheries resources, over-fishing by the European fishing fleet and the increase in the number of products of illegal fishing that find their way onto the European market.\nThis highly lucrative illegal fishing speeds up the deterioration of fish resources and marine ecosystems and destabilises the entire sector, which is feeling the full force of this unfair competition.\nThe proposal by the European Commission and this report are thus essential elements in the implementation of sustainable, responsible fishing that enables European fishermen to earn a living.\nThis report was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Fisheries. Our aim today is to send a strong signal to the Council, to the most closely involved Member States, which must today take full responsibility and implement the necessary rapid, effective measures. I am counting on your determination.\n", "16. Proposal for a decision on the setting up and numerical strength of the Delegation to the CARIFORUM-EC Parliamentary Committee (vote) \n\nPresident\nColleagues, for those who would like to listen to the explanation about the T\u0151k\u00e9s vote:\nMembers voting: 621 - which is votes in favour and abstentions; votes cast in favour: 334; abstentions: 287, but they are not counted as votes cast. The absolute majority is 168.\nMr T\u0151k\u00e9s obtained 334 votes, more than the absolute majority of 168. The electronic voting system is used as an alternative to a vote with ballot papers. On a ballot paper for an election, voters can only vote in favour of a candidate or a fixed number of candidates. There is never any possibility of voting against, as Mrs Roth-Behrendt explained. Voters not wishing to vote in favour leave the ballot paper blank. Therefore, I welcome Pastor T\u0151k\u00e9s to the Bureau.\nStavros Lambrinidis\nMr President, just to understand, what you are telling us is that, for the vote on a Vice-President, it is impossible ever not to get a qualified majority, because, if you can only vote in favour or be taken down as abstention, and if abstentions do not count towards the total vote, then by definition, you always get a qualified majority. Is that what you are saying?\nPresident\nAs you recall, Mr Lambrinidis, at the beginning of this Parliament, there were in fact three ballots in order to elect all the Vice-Presidents on a qualified majority, so that was the procedure we followed on that occasion. On this occasion, there was only one candidate and, given that he received more than 168 votes, he got more than the qualified majority and is therefore elected on a single vote. This procedure is an unusual one, but we have followed the rules.\nRobert Goebbels\n(FR) Mr President, you may have been following the rules, but when I add 334 votes in favour, 168 abstentions and 287 people who voted against, I get 789 Members, in other words, more Members than there are in the House. This means ", "Statement by the President\nPresident\nI would like, most of all, to express the hope that our work with other European institutions in implementing the Treaty of Lisbon, which enters into force in a week, will flow smoothly. I am constantly working on this matter, and am in contact with both the President of the European Commission and the Prime Minister, who represents the Swedish Presidency. I would also like to repeat that the European Parliament is ready to proceed with the hearings of the commissioners-designate. We are prepared for this, and I have also informed both institutions of this - the Council and the Commission (that is, the President of the Commission).\n\nNext week, on 1 December, it will be World AIDS Day. It is important that we always, and not only on this day, remember the victims of this terrible disease. Remembrance of the victims and knowledge of the disease may contribute to a reduction in new cases in the future.\n\nIn two weeks, on 10 December, it will be the 61st anniversary of the adoption and proclamation by the General Assembly of the United Nations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Its adoption was a consequence of the events of the Second World War. The Declaration was adopted unanimously, and it is worth stressing this. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights can be considered the first significant achievement of the United Nations in the area of the protection of human rights. I draw your attention to this important date, because this area is one of the main interests of the European Parliament, and rightly so. We should always remember this matter.\n", "Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nHaarder\nMr President, I have wanted for a long time to comment on the bell which summons us to meetings. We are very glad that it is rung, but is it necessary to ring it for several minutes at a time so that we get sick to death of hearing it? Would you mind telling the department concerned to ring it in small doses.\n\nPresident\nMr Haarder, as you know, it only takes a few minutes to decide on important strategies but we need more time for small matters. You raised this issue during the last parliamentary term too. We shall see if we can do something about this.\n\nFlemming\nMr President, I think they did not ring the bell for long enough, and you can see what happened - no one is here! So could you make sure they ring it longer and louder in future?\n\nPresident\nAs you know, Mrs Flemming, it is not the bell that makes Members hurry here, it is whether or not there are going to be votes in the House. In this case no votes are envisaged, and consequently several Members are working in their offices.\n\nHager\nMr President, I only wanted to ask Mrs Flemming not to call me \"no one\" !\n\nPresident\nYour clarification will be recorded in the Minutes.\n(The Minutes were approved)\n\nSperoni\nMr President, I refer to Rule 43 and Annex II on the time periods for submitting a question. I had already raised this point and the President has kindly sent me a reply which, however, I do not believe conforms to the Rules of Procedure because, if the Rules of Procedure says one week, then one week cannot be understood to mean seven working days. Seven days can mean seven calendar days or seven working days, but a week cannot mean this, just as a month, or a year, for example, cannot be considered to mean 365 working days. Moreover, the deadline is fixed for the Thursday of the week before the week when the question will be discussed, but given that the quest", "8. European Banking Authority (\nBefore the final vote:\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda-Margallo y Marfil\nMadam President, I would like quite simply to thank the other rapporteurs, as we have worked together in an exemplary manner on what was a difficult package: we had before us a Council agreement that had been approved unanimously.\nParliament now has a mandate that was also approved practically unanimously, with the enormous advantage that the winds are blowing in Parliament's direction and not that of the Council's text, which now seems extraordinarily archaic.\nThank you to my group, thank you to all of the groups, and thank you to Parliament, which has won an important victory today.\n", "1. Framework Agreement on relations between the European Parliament and the Commission (\n- Before the vote:\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso\nPresident of the Commission. - Mr President, a few months ago in my political guidelines and here in plenary, I proposed taking this special partnership between Parliament and the Commission to a new level. I proposed further enforcing and developing our relations in a positive way to reflect the new treaty and to reflect our shared sense of purpose to shape Europe together.\nIn the last few weeks, I had in-depth discussions with the team of negotiators led by Mr Lehne, whom you appointed, for the revision of the Framework Agreement. Let me take this opportunity to thank all of them for very intensive discussions, but also for their constructive approach.\nI am deeply satisfied that we have now found a common understanding on the principles that will govern our relationship in the coming years. They should reinforce our cooperation in full respect of the institutional balance set up by the treaties.\nAs President of the European Commission, I will subscribe to the principles laid down in the resolution you have just adopted. They will guide me in developing the position of the new College on the revision of the full Framework Agreement.\nWith the adoption of this resolution by such an impressive majority of this House, I am confident that we have an excellent base for reinforcing our relationship. For those issues that concern not only our two institutions but also the Council, I sincerely hope the Council will join us in this common effort to improve the work of all the institutions for the benefit of Europe.\nIf you approve the new College later today, I will ask Vice-President designate \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d to lead negotiations on the Commission side to revise the Framework Agreement. I wish to assure you that he is as committed as I am - as, I am sure, are all the new College - to effective and swift negotiations.\nPresident\nThank you very much, Presiden", "Multiannual framework for the Fundamental Rights Agency for 2007-2012 (debate) \nPresident\n(FR) The next item is the report by Michael Cashman, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Decision of the Council implementing Regulation (EC) n\u00b0 168/2007 on the adoption of a multiannual framework for the Fundamental Rights Agency for 2007-2012 - C6-0322/2007 -.\nA point of order here: could the Honourable Member please tell me which article of the Regulation he is referring to?\nRoger Knapman\nMr President, on a point of order under Rule 171. Just now you told the House that 19 Members had sought to make speeches. Before lunch we were told that there were 14 Members. I know that when it comes to statistics, and particularly when there is no roll-call vote, things are a bit loose here, but could you explain the difference between those two figures?\nPresident\n(FR) It is difficult to give you an explanation here and now, but I shall do my best.\nWe receive requests to speak - and I have been in the chair on many occasions for explanations of vote - in real time. In all probability what happened was that when Mr Vidal-Quadras made his announcement there were 14 names on the rostrum before him, then, within seconds or minutes, other Members of the House approached the rostrum to tell the President that they wished to speak. That is undoubtedly why the figure increased from 14 to 19 in the interval between Mr Vidal-Quadras's announcement and my own of just a moment ago. It is, however, a very interesting point and we shall check the relevant rule.\nPermit me now, if you will, to return to the Cashman report and to begin straight away with the Commission representative.\nFranco Frattini\nVice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Parliament for the very constructive cooperation and support for the quick adoption of the multiannual framework for the Fundamental Rights Agency for the years 20", "One-minute speeches on matters of political importance\nPresident\nThe next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.\nNicodim Bulzesc\nMr President, on 4 and 5 December 2008 the European Parliament will discuss a set of proposals to modify Directive 2003/87/EC concerning the emissions trading scheme for greenhouse gas emissions for the period 2013-2020.\nThe proposal foresees a huge increase in auctioning as early as 2013. While today 90% of pollution allowances are handed out to industrial installations for free, the new directive states that full auctioning should be the rule from 2013 onwards.\nIn the case of Romania, this will have extremely severe consequences on the whole economy, and the industry will be seriously affected. Many industrial companies would have to relocate to third countries with less climate protection, which will raise prices and slow down Romania's development project on infrastructure. This is why I ask that industries in Romania should receive all their allowances for CO2 certificates for free for the entire period.\nMiguel Angel Mart\u00ednez Mart\u00ednez\n(ES) Mr President, last night, in a joint and extremely smooth operation on French territory, security forces from France and Spain arrested one of the main and perhaps most bloodthirsty leaders of ETA, Txeroki, whom they have been pursuing for more than six years for various murders and attacks.\nWhile exercising the caution that is always needed in such cases, I believe that this is very good news and I am sure that the House will share our satisfaction, which makes up for our disgust on other occasions when we have had to speak about the crimes of this organisation.\nThis is a very severe blow for the terrorist organisation and we should congratulate the security forces, governments and people of France and Spain on the success of the operation. We should also congratulate ourselves on the example set by international cooperation as an essential instrument of anti-terrorist ", "10. Equality between men and women in the committees' work (vote) \n- Before the vote on paragraph 6\nJohannes Blokland\n(NL) Mr President, the rapporteur has asked me to withdraw the split vote, which we applied for in respect of paragraph 6, and instead, to opt for an oral amendment which amounts to replacing 'gender perspectives' by 'equal treatment of men and women'. I am happy to grant Mrs Z\u00e1borsk\u00e1 this request.\n(The oral amendment was accepted)\nPresident\nThat concludes the vote.\n", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 15 February 2001.\n\nStatement by the President\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, as you know, on 22 February there were unfortunately two more additions to the intolerable list of victims killed in ETA terrorist attacks in Spain.\nThe bomb attack in San Sebastian was directly targeted at Ignacio Dubreil, a local councillor of the Basque Socialist Party in Ordizia. The explosion killed Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Santos and Jos\u00e9 Leonet, employees of Electra, and four further people were injured, including Mr Dubreil.\nOnce again, ETA terrorists have shown that they deny the right to life and reject the very principle of the rule of law. On behalf of the House, I have sent a message of our deepest sympathy to the families of the victims and wishes for the prompt recovery of those injured in the attack. I now ask you to please stand and observe a minute' s silence.\n(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)\n\nAgenda\nPresident\nRelating to the agendas for the sittings on Wednesday 28 February and Thursday 1 March, I have a number of amendments to put to you, at the request of the political groups.\nRelating to Wednesday: I propose that the Commission communication on human resources in the context of reform, to be presented by Mr Prodi and Mr Kinnock on behalf of the Commission, should be brought forward in the agenda. That means we would be timetabling this communication between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m., because the Commission already took a decision at its meeting this morning.\nSecondly, I propose to also bring forward the debate on Mrs Haug' s report on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget in relation to the BSE crisis, to be dealt with immediately after the Commission communication.\nFinally, at the request of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and with the agreement of the political groups, I propose entering on the", "2. Nicaragua\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Nicaragua.\nMarios Matsakis\nauthor. - Madam President, freedom of expression, the independence of the judiciary and the preservation of the fundamental principles of democracy appear to be under threat in this Latin American country. It is our task and duty, as EU parliamentarians, to stand by the rights of the Nicaraguan people and to send a clear message to the Government of Nicaragua that we will not tolerate any breaches of such rights, but we will make sure that all necessary pressure is applied by the EU and the UN to safeguard and ensure respect for the human rights of the citizens of Nicaragua.\nI hope this message, embodied in this motion for a resolution, will be heard loud and clear by those concerned and the necessary action to remedy the situation will be taken urgently.\nManuel Medina Ortega\nWe have a motion for a resolution on Nicaragua in which we have to take a number of factors into account. First of all, there are allegations of fraud - in the two municipalities of Nicaragua and Le\u00f3n, at least - and that tarnishes the outcome of the election on 9 November. On the other hand, we have a government that has tried to resolve some of the problems that take away human rights in Latin America, namely poverty, illiteracy, infant mortality, availability of drinking water, and lack of title to indigenous lands.\nWhen we examine the case, therefore, we must make a clear distinction between these two aspects. On one hand we must boost human rights and uphold human rights, in their traditional sense, as political rights, whereas on the other we must encourage the Nicaraguan Government to continue helping the most deprived sectors in the country. We must also, of course, ensure that the opposition can fulfil its role, we must take a stand against fraud, and we must endorse the work of NGOs. Nonetheless, there must be a balanced outcome.\nThe Socialist Group in the European Parliamen", "6. Transparency in regional policy and its funding (\n- Before the vote:\nMichail Tremopoulos\nrapporteur. - (EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the incentive for this report on transparency in regional policy and its funding was the fact that the full disclosure of EU fund recipients enables public participation in a meaningful debate on how European public money is spent. This is necessary for the functioning of democracy at European level.\nThis report, which was allocated to me by the Committee on Regional Development, contains recommendations which should be included in future regulations on the Structural Funds, such as the provision of additional information needed when publishing lists of recipients and sufficiently binding rules for partnership.\nOther proposals which can be implemented within the framework of current cohesion programmes are, for example:\nthe definition by the Commission of a more detailed and prescriptive format specifying the structure, form and content of the information to be provided;\nalso, linking the European transparency initiative with the new financial controls and auditing;\na tougher line by auditors on communication and information requirements, including 'naming and shaming' and the use of financial corrections in confirmed cases of fraud;\ncloser involvement of regional and local authorities and other relevant partners in all the phases of cohesion programming and implementation and full access for them to all project documentation;\nmore guidance from the Commission on how to put the partnership clause into practice under current programmes and improving transparency in respect of EU funding of major projects.\nI should like once again to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups for this final text which we were able to achieve.\n", "Statement by the President\nPresident\nBefore reading the Minutes, I have to take a decision which really affords me no pleasure. Last night there was an unpleasant incident in the House when, for the first time ever, a Member of this Parliament physically attacked another Member of this Parliament.\nThe Rules contain plenty of measures for dealing with inappropriate behaviour, including extremely aggressive acts, and there are corresponding formalities. We cannot allow verbal attacks, however aggressive, to lead to actual physical violence.\nMrs Hoff, who was in the Chair at that point in the sitting, issued the appropriate reprimand under Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure, and at the same time announced that Rule 110 would be applied.\nAs you know - and I will read out the Rule - ' In serious cases of disorder, the President may, after giving formal notice, move, either immediately or no later than the next sitting, that Parliament pass a vote of censure which shall automatically involve immediate exclusion from the Chamber and suspension for two to five days.'\nThis morning's sitting is the next sitting, and, pursuant to that Rule, I am obliged to move a vote of censure on Mr Rosado Fernandes, which would entail his suspension for two days.\nAs is reasonable, and laid down in paragraph 2 of the same Rule, Mr Rosado Fernandes is entitled to explain his behaviour to Parliament. I ask Mr Rosado Fernandes whether he wishes to exercise that right, and naturally invite him to speak.\nMr Rosado Fernandes.\n\nRosado Fernandes\nMr President, I will speak in Portuguese, since I have the honour to be addressing a President who speaks my language.\nYesterday something happened which I would have liked to avoid, and which I am not proud of. I find myself subject to disciplinary procedure and I no doubt deserve it. But I would like to ask this House what any of us would do when a Member who has no knowledge of our lives and thinks we are not in the Chamber - and I was still in the Chambe", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\nMr Schierhuber has the floor.\n\nSchiedermeier\nMr President, my name is Schiedermeier!\nMr President, I only found the Minutes of 19 October, in other words Monday's Minutes, in my pigeon hole yesterday afternoon, and although I was present and signed in, unfortunately my name is not on the list of attendance. Could I ask you to correct that?\n\nPresident\nMr Schiedermeier, I must apologise to you on two counts. Firstly because due to my age and the distance involved, I had not recognised you, and secondly because there is indeed an error in the Minutes, which will be corrected. Thank you.\n\nLalumi\u00e8re\nMr President, my name does not appear on yesterday's attendance list, although I was, of course, here. I would like this to be corrected. Thank you.\n\nPresident\nVery well, Mrs Lalumi\u00e8re, that error will be corrected. You will be included in the list.\n(The Minutes were approved) Now, following our usual practice, I shall address the House in order to open the debate on the state of the Union.\n\nState of the Union - Meeting of heads of state and government of 24/25 October\nPresident\nMr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, this is the last debate on the state of the Union to be held before the end of the current parliamentary term, that is to say, before the elections due in June 1999. I will not, however, succumb to the temptation of summing up the current term. It is too soon to do so, and much can be achieved in eight months.\nNor shall I anticipate Parliament's position in the run-up to the informal meeting of heads of state and government. I should like to express my gratitude to Chancellor Klima for convening it, and for extending an invitation for Parliament to take part in one of these informal summits for the first time. It will provide an opportunity for us to express our initial thoughts on", "Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nWurtz\nMadam President, a gross mistake has found its way into Item 34 of the Minutes of yesterday' s sitting concerning the adoption of the resolution on Euro 2000. The Minutes show this resolution to have been adopted by Parliament when in fact it was rejected by an overwhelming majority. Moreover, the resolution is also listed among the texts adopted whereas notification of its rejection should appear in this part.\n\nPresident\nThis will obviously be corrected.\n\nSturdy\nMadam President, following your statement yesterday regarding the state of the air conditioning in the building, I have a slight problem in my position as Chairman of the Delegation for relations with Canada. I have a group of Canadian members of parliament coming to the next part-session in Strasbourg. I will have to take a decision on Monday as to whether they will be travelling to Strasbourg or Brussels. Bearing in mind the French position on the precautionary principle, can a decision be taken rather sooner than a fortnight on where we will be meeting next month?\n\nPresident\nMr Sturdy, as you know, and as the Quaestors point out in the memo which you have received, checks will be carried out at Parliament' s three places of work, that is to say, Strasbourg, Brussels and Luxembourg. Unfortunately, we will then have to wait for the result of these checks.\nI would therefore advise you to contact Mr Poos, so that he can keep you informed of the situation.\n\nSumberg\nMadam President, I rise on the same point of order as my colleague, Mr Sturdy. It is essential that this Parliament should show by example and precept that it follows the same standards that it imposes upon everybody else. It imposes standards on beef in Britain and cheese in France and it must follow the same example in relation to its own conduct. I am perfectly prepared, in an extreme situation, to d", "Review of the European Neighbourhood Policy - Eastern Dimension - Review of the European Neighbourhood Policy - Southern Dimension\nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the Commission statements on:\nReview of the European Neighbourhood Policy - Eastern Dimension\nReview of the European Neighbourhood Policy - Southern Dimension.\n\u0160tefan F\u00fcle\nMember of the Commission. - Madam President, I am delighted to have this opportunity to have an exchange of views with Parliament on the European Neighbourhood Policy.\nIn the context of the current events in the Southern Mediterranean, redeveloping this policy could not be more important. In fact, over the past nine months, the Commission has undertaken a review of the policy. I want to take this opportunity to thank Members for their input into the consultation, which took responses from partner countries, EU Member States, academics and civil society groups.\nI have read both M\u00e1rio David's report on the south and Marek Siwiec's report on the east and find them both significant and useful. I am pleased that our thoughts are along the same lines.\nYou will have noticed that the results of our previous discussions on Neighbourhood Policy are already reflected in the communication on a partnership for democracy and shared prosperity of 8 March. Now, we are preparing for the wider communication on the results of the review, which is due to be published in May. A key outcome of the review is a new emphasis on differentiation of the Neighbourhood Policy, according to the needs and wishes of each partner country. While the policy will continue to offer engagement to all partners, every neighbour is different and has different aspirations. Some partner countries want to progress as far as they can towards the European Union - indeed as far as accession - but others prefer to make the most of other benefits of the Neighbourhood Policy. So it will deliver more for more, in a specific and differentiated way, alongside stronger politic", "LIFE+ - Financing of the Natura 2000 network\nPresident\nThe next item is\nthe recommendation for second reading (06284/1/2006 C6-0226/2006 on the Council common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the Financial Instrument for the Environment (LIFE+)) (Rapporteur: Mrs Isler B\u00e9guin)\nthe debate on the oral question to the Commission on financing of the NATURA 2000 framework by Mr Florenz, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety B6-0441/2006).\nMarie Anne Isler B\u00e9guin \nrapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must begin by thanking the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and, in particular, my fellow shadow rapporteurs for the work that we have done together, because I believe that it can be said - even though, as is customary at this hour, the Chamber is not very full - that we have genuinely carried out a joint piece of work and that this report, which bears my name, could just as well bear the name of my fellow Members, Mrs Guti\u00e9rrez-Cortines, Mrs Ries or even Mrs Lienemann, who apologises for not being able to take part in this evening's debate.\nWe have also produced a joint piece of work with the Commission. Unfortunately, it is regrettable that the Council is not present, because, ultimately, our results will depend greatly on it. I am entirely convinced that the cooperation that we have been able to put in place during this first reading and that follows on from the common position will enable us to reach a consensus with the Council and with yourself, and I am counting on you, Commissioner, to pass the results of this debate on to the Council.\nIndeed, ladies and gentlemen, LIFE+ is no longer the programme that we once knew, but will indeed constitute the Union's 'environment' budget heading. Thus, it is LIFE+ that will govern Europe's innovative policies, that will rise to the challenges, such as the fight", "6. Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EC and Bosnia and Herzegovina (\n- On paragraph 22\nDoris Pack\ndraftsman. - (DE) Mr President, I have an oral amendment to paragraph 22, which I have agreed with other fellow Members. We must correct the text because it does not exactly represent the truth. After the Missing Persons Institute and following the semi-colon, we should change the sentence. I will read the change out in English now:\n- 'urges the corresponding urgencies at the entity level to support the work of the state-level bodies by forwarding to them all the relevant information they gather;'.\nPresident\n(DE) That is paragraph 22. I do not see any opposition, so we will vote on it.\n(The oral amendment was accepted)\n", "Gender mainstreaming in the work of committees and delegations (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is a short presentation of the report by Mrs Z\u00e1borsk\u00e1, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on gender mainstreaming in the work of its committee and delegations.\nWritten statements (Rule 142)\nAnna Z\u00e1borsk\u00e1\nIn recent years women's dignity and calling have taken on a new dimension. This is particularly noticeable within the framework of Community horizontal policies defined in the Lisbon Strategy, demographic challenges and efforts to achieve a work-life balance, as well as moves to combat violence against women and people trafficking.\nThe report on gender mainstreaming in the work of committees and delegations is one of the regular reports of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality which I have had the honour to present to Parliament on two occasions during the legislative period. Although some people welcome the growing presence of women in the European Parliament, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality deplores the fact that women are still insufficiently represented in the senior functional bodies of the Parliament. At the general directorate level the representation of women is still insufficient. We support the creation of networks of officials in secretariats, committees and delegations specially trained in this issue, with the aim of regularly exchanging tried and tested procedures.\nThe report calls on the general secretariat to continue implementing an integrated work-life strategy and to facilitate the career progress of women officials. The report emphasises that gender mainstreaming is a positive development both for women and for men and that the requirement for gender equality must make itself felt through a practical approach which does not pit women and men against each other.\nThe Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality stresses the need for committees and delegations to have suitable", "Discharge for the financial year 2005 (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on\nthe report by Salvador Garriga Polledo, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the discharge for implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2005, Section III - Commission [SEC(2006)0916 - C6-0263/2006 - [SEC(2006)0915 - C6-0262/2006 -,\nthe report by Bart Staes, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the discharge for implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2005, Section I - European Parliament [C6-0465/2006 -,\nthe report by Daniel Caspary, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the discharge for implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2005, Section II - Council [C6-0466/2006 -,\nthe report by Daniel Caspary, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the discharge for implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2005, Section IV - Court of Justice [C6-0467/2006 -,\nthe report by Daniel Caspary, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the discharge for implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2005, Section V - Court of Auditors [C6-0468/2006 -,\nthe report by Daniel Caspary, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the discharge for implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2005, Section VI - European Economic and Social Committee [C6-0469/2006 -,\nthe report by Daniel Caspary, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the discharge for implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2005, Section VII - Committee of the Regions [C6-0470/2006 -,\nthe report by Daniel Caspary, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the discharge for implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2005, Section VIII A - European Ombudsman [C6-0471/2006 -,\nth", "Reporting formalities for ships arriving in or departing from ports (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Dirk Sterckx, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on reporting formalities for ships arriving in and/or departing from ports of the Member States of the Community and repealing Directive 2002/6/EC - C6-0030/2009 -.\nDirk Sterckx\nMr President, when a container is transported from Gdansk to Antwerp by a lorry, then that container remains within the EU and the goods do not have to be customs-cleared on arrival or departure. However, when you ship the same container from Gdansk to Antwerp, you first have to clear the goods on departure and then again on arrival, as if that container has left the EU. That is to the detriment of coastal transport and I think the Commission is right in wanting to rectify this disadvantage. I also think that coastal transport could take on a larger share of EU goods transport and that we ought to encourage that.\nIn that context, I welcome the agreement we have reached and I thank the people in the Council who worked on that, the people in the Commission and members in this House. We have reached a good agreement. The basic line taken by that agreement, the principle of administrative simplification and harmonisation, has been accepted. Data will always be exchanged electronically and everyone concerned will be able to view or enter data via what is known as a single window. That will allow computer systems to communicate with each other. Everything only has to be entered once and that is an enormous improvement.\nShips calling only at EU ports will also be granted an exemption from administrative formalities. What we have not achieved is permission for a ship to be granted exemption on the basis of its cargo, in respect of that cargo, if a ship has called at a port in a third country. The Commission will now look into how we might r", "Further convergence in supervisory practices at EU level (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on:\nthe oral question by Pervenche Ber\u00e8s, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, to the Council, on further convergence in supervisory practices at EU level - B6-0010/2007), and\nthe oral question by Pervenche Ber\u00e8s, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, to the Commission, on further convergence in supervisory practices at EU level B6-0449/2006).\nPervenche Ber\u00e8s \nauthor. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs thought it necessary that there should be a debate on supervision among the European institutions, and we wanted to be able to have one in the presence of the Council and of the Commission. We, members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, are very pleased about the relaunch of discussions and work, within the Council and the Commission alike, on the management of the crisis on the financial markets. More effective and better supervision and cooperation among supervisors is a matter of necessity, but, nevertheless, if we want the ultimate result to be success, we do think that, at this stage of the development and profound transformation of financial markets, the opening of an interinstitutional debate on this subject is, without doubt, the best way of making headway.\nThe Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has done a great deal of work on the analysis of the European financial system and the implications of consolidation in financial services, not least in Mr Muscat's report, in which we express our support for the establishment of a Committee of Wise Men mandated not only to examine the implications of the consolidation of markets and of financial institutions, together with the implications of financial supervision, financial stability and crisis management, but also to come up with definite ideas about the existing structure", "European Council meeting (15-16 October 2008) (debate)\nPresident\nThe next item is the European Council report and the Commission statement on the European Council meeting (15-16 October 2008).\nMr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Sarkozy, Mr President of the European Commission, Mr Barroso, over the last few weeks we have endured some extremely difficult moments in which the European Union, under your Presidency, has demonstrated its ability to take action. Had the countries of Europe not found a common solution, had there not been an agreement between the European partners, and had there not been the euro, it is highly likely that we would have found ourselves in a disastrous situation today.\nThe Eurogroup proposals of ten days ago, the European Council's decisions of last Wednesday and the commitments entered into this weekend at the Camp David Summit are a series of successes that reflect a genuine coordination of actions and efforts aimed at carrying out the reforms needed to respond effectively to the problems of the global economy. However, the governments were not the only ones to respond to the crisis. The European Council, under your leadership, working side by side with the European Commission and with the European Parliament, has ensured that the European Union played a crucial role regarding the well-being of all our citizens, to whom we are all responsible.\nIt has often been in times of crisis that the European Union has demonstrated its true strength, thanks to you, Mr Sarkozy, and thanks to the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso. European action has been joint action. That is why, before opening this morning's debate, I should like to congratulate you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council and Mr President of the Commission.\nNicolas Sarkozy\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honour for me to come here once again before the European Parliament to report on the work of the Council Presidency", "\n\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is the statement by the President of the Commission on the Commission\u2019s strategic political orientations. \nBarroso,\n\u00a0\u00a0 . \u2013 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the four weeks that have passed since my team was given your support, we have rolled up our sleeves and set to work. Our main objective has been to draw up proposals for a common vision to govern the activities of Parliament, the Council and the Commission over the coming years. This vision will flesh out the partnership for prosperity, solidarity and security, which I announced here last July. It will identify the main economic, social and environmental challenges upon which our success will depend, and it will put forward priorities and solutions. It cannot be a unilateral exercise, however.\nThis is why this debate is important. This is why I am here today to listen to you. I want to hear Parliament\u2019s proposals, as they will be an essential contribution to our joint thinking. I want to hear the concerns and, through you, to get to know the opinions of the millions of Europeans that you represent. Why is that so important? Because I am sure that the success of this Commission, of this Parliament and of the European project that we share depends on our showing that the European Union can make a difference, both within our borders and without.\nJust as we are now preparing to ratify the European Constitution, we must not forget Europe\u2019s remarkable achievements: half a century of peace and of social and economic development, as well as the recent enlargement representing the reunification of our continent.\nWe must not, however, underestimate the challenges that we face and that require a Europe-wide response: the increasing age of our populations, the damage done to the environment and the effects of climate change, the need to adapt our economy to the competitive context of globalisation, and the threats to our peace and security. \n\nToday I do not intend to present a detailed acc", "Conclusions of the EU/Russia Summit (31 May - 1 June) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the conclusions of the EU/Russia Summit (31 May - 1 June).\nCatherine Ashton\nVice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Madam President, I am delighted that we have a chance today to talk about the outcome of the last EU-Russia Summit in Rostov-on-Don. It was a good summit, it was pragmatic and constructive in character and it confirmed Russia's desire for a stronger relationship with the European Union.\nAt the summit, we launched the Partnership for Modernisation. As honourable Members know, a constant theme in President Medvedev's time in office has been his recognition that Russia must modernise. The EU - as Russia's most important trade partner and biggest investor - is a natural partner in this. Our approach is clear: to be successful, any drive to modernise must take a broad approach. It must encourage innovation and entrepreneurship, but also strengthen democratic values and the rule of law. This is why the effective functioning of the judiciary, the fight against corruption and dialogue with civil society are priority areas for the Partnership for Modernisation.\nAs the EU has in the past, we raised concerns about the day-to-day situation for human rights defenders and journalists. The demonstrations on 31 May in Moscow were an example of the difficulties that continue regarding the constitutional right to freedom of assembly. Growing instability in the North Caucasus is another area of concern.\nBut there have been positive developments too, and it is important we acknowledge them: the extension of the moratorium on the death penalty and the ratification of Protocol 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Work on the rule of law and fighting corruption will also contribut", "Financing of actions other than Official Development Assistance in countries falling under Regulation (EC) 1905/2006 (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Berman, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on financing of actions other than Official Development Assistance in countries falling under Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006.\nThijs Berman\nI, too, am pleased that Mr Deva has taken a seat, for now Mrs Ferrero-Waldner will be able to hear me, which is a great relief.\nThis unprecedented economic crisis, which is biting hard, spells renewed disaster for developing countries. The crisis leads to a drop in prices for raw materials, fewer investments, less trade credit and less money being sent home by immigrants. Meanwhile, the gross domestic products of all the rich countries are dwindling fast, which means that the budget for development cooperation is also being decimated as this is 0.7% of GDP, or at least that is what it is supposed to be, and even then, most countries fail to live up to their promises.\nThis is the context of the discussion about the new policy instrument that is being held here. If Spanish students receive a grant to study in Latin America for a few months, or vice versa, then such an exchange is useful, necessary and desirable, but a project such as this cannot be exclusively financed with funds that are intended to fight poverty. Whilst EU funding in this area is to be welcomed, it is not fighting poverty. It is frustrating to have to withdraw projects like this simply because there is no legal basis on which to back them.\nThat is why we have been looking for a modest instrument with which the EU can implement policy in developing countries that does not, strictly speaking, fall within the scope of fighting poverty. A financial source and a legal basis that do not come under development policy will need to be found. The legal basis cannot, therefore, lie in Article 179 of the Treaty of Nice, because that is precisely the statutory", "World hunger and the elimination of barriers to trade with the poorest countries\nPresident. -\nThe next item is the Commission statement on world hunger and the elimination of barriers to trade with the poorest countries.\n\nFerrer (PPE-DE).\nMr President, I very much regret that the Commissioner is unable to be with us. It seems to me that it might be wise to adjust our arrangements so that the Commissioner himself could read the text to be adopted. He ought to see the agreements reached in the common resolution through. We would then transcend mere words.\nI am sure we all agree that the terrible scourge of hunger in the world casts shame on all those who are in a position to prevent it. The figures speak for themselves. We are all aware of the alarming statistics. Nonetheless, I believe they bear repetition. I would venture to say that we are numbered amongst the lucky few who live comfortably, in an affluent society. Meanwhile, 900 people die of hunger every hour. In addition, 800 million people are malnourished and 300 of these are children.\nWhat is worse, the numbers remain stubbornly high and we are light years away from reaching the target of halving the number of malnourished people by the year 2015. That was the date set at the 1996 World Food Summit and confirmed in the Millennium Declaration. It is not a particularly ambitious target. Nonetheless, we are unlikely to reach it despite the fact that a number of countries have made determined efforts to reduce poverty and improve food safety.\nThe current state of affairs as portrayed by these statistics proves beyond all doubt that the time for words and for grand declarations is long since past, particularly if account is also taken of the implications of malnutrition and their negative impact on development in the countries concerned. Hunger cannot wait. The time has come to take a quantum leap as regards the strategy needed to rid ourselves of this scourge. We need to go to the very root of the problem if we a", "5. Impact of aviation security measures and body scanners on human rights, privacy, personal dignity and data protection (\n- Before the vote\nManfred Weber\non behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group I would like to introduce a motion. In Parliament, we quite clearly agree on two points. On the one hand, we want to be involved in the procedure for these new technical variants and this cannot be decided without Parliament. I would like to thank Commissioner Tajani, who has ensured that this is the case.\nSecondly, it is clear to all of us that this new technical measure must be considered with a great deal of sensitivity. We have a number of concerns about it. The criteria for the possible application must be carefully controlled and everyone in the House agrees on this. I would like to move on behalf of the PPE-DE Group that we give ourselves an extra four weeks and postpone the vote until November, because Commissioner Tajani has stated that there will be a major hearing on the subject in November. The PPE-DE Group is of the opinion that we should hear all the facts before we come to a decision. I hope that we will have a majority in favour of this. This is why we are moving that the vote be adjourned until November.\nMartin Schulz\non behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to oppose this motion for the following reason. It is true that Mr Tajani's hearing will give us the opportunity to acquire additional information and to define our position. However, what we are doing with this decision is to tell the Council, which has already reached a resolution during the last Council of Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs, that in our view, and this applies at least to my group, security and security measures are absolutely essential. However, the use of scanners or display devices which show people completely naked is totally unacceptable. This is a violation of human dignity and it is not accom", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nFrancesco De Angelis\n(IT) Mr President, I voted in favour of the report on the labelling of textile products because I think that Europe could and should do more to support enterprises in the industry. The proposal made by the Commission was purely technical and aimed to simplify the current provisions regarding labelling.\nYet Parliament achieved two significant results. Firstly, textile products comprising non-textile parts of animal origin - fur and leather - must show this information on the labels in order to allow consumers to make informed choices. Secondly, by 2013, the European Commission must present an impact study on the introduction of labelling, clearly showing which garments have been produced in Europe, and which outside of Europe. The latter objective is an important milestone for the competitiveness of European textiles in Europe and the world.\nMorten L\u00f8kkegaard\n(DA) Mr President, congratulations to Mr Manders for having succeeded in drawing up this proposal. It has proven to be more complicated than it looked at the start. I am pleased that we succeeded in reaching agreement on this Textile Labelling Regulation, which will strengthen the textile industry's competitiveness and benefit consumers by providing a greater choice of new and innovative products. It is a good compromise that I believe the Council will be able to live with, too.\nDuring this process, I have not disguised my own scepticism regarding the introduction of origin labelling. I am therefore also pleased that we agreed on a text that merely requires the Commission to analyse the need for origin labelling. Thus, the agreement will not lead to the introduction of mandatory origin labelling. I will be unable to vote in favour of a regulation that makes it mandatory for businesses to provide this country of origin label. I know that the Council is of the same opinion. Unfortunately, yesterday's debate highlighted the fact that Commissioner T", "Life assurance\nPresident\nThe next item is the report (A5-0072/2001) by Lord Inglewood, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive concerning life assurance [COM(2000) 398 - C5-0351/2000 - 2000/0162(COD)].\n\nHarbour\nMr President, on behalf of Lord Inglewood I should like to say that he is extremely sorry not to be here, but he is unavoidably detained in the UK for family and business reasons.\nThis report, which I am pleased to present on his behalf and on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is an important part of the Legal Affairs Committee's remit on behalf of Parliament to encourage simplification and good-quality drafting of Community legislative instruments. In this particular case, quite a lot of important work has been done by the Commission in incorporating and simplifying three texts related to life insurance. The source text dates as far back as 1979 and, apart from the codification process of incorporating amendments that have been made over that period into the legislative text, the reason for this more substantive report is that the Commission has found it necessary to propose a number of amendments to reflect changes that have taken place in the market since that time and to improve the overall quality and integrity of the text.\nI do not need to detain the House with a lot of the technical details relating to those texts. Those of you that are experts on the subject will clearly want to refer to the Commission's own text and the Commission has provided an extremely helpful and clear explanatory statement for those of us who are not, unlike Lord Inglewood, distinguished lawyers - which is why he has been able to make such a good job of scrutinising this text on behalf of Parliament.\nIn view of the work that has been done, our job here is just to ensure that there are no political issues arising out of what is largely a set of technical am", "9. Aviation security with a special focus on security scanners (\nJ\u00f6rg Leichtfried\n(DE) Madam President, this oral amendment does not involve an earth-shattering change to the entire report. Nonetheless, it is not insignificant that the text after the word 'effectiveness' in paragraph 4 should continue as follows:\n... and in full compliance with Article 21 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights on non-discrimination and in line with EU Legislation on data protection.\n(DE) Madam President, I would ask that this amendment should be supported.\n", "Efficiency of the European agencies linked to employment, working conditions and training (debate) \nPresident\n\u03a4he next item is the Commission statement on the efficiency of the European agencies linked to employment, working conditions and training.\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Andor\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, I wish to thank this House for putting the issue of European agencies on the agenda.\nThe Commission attaches great importance to the European Union agencies' efficient functioning. Part of this is related to the governance arrangements which apply to all of them. As you are aware, the agencies' functioning and governance are currently being discussed within the interinstitutional working group involving the Commission, Parliament and the Council, on the basis, inter alia, of a multi-agency evaluation carried out for the Commission in 2009. Indeed, the time has come to shape a new overall approach to EU agencies, improving their overall coherence, effectiveness, accountability and transparency.\nThe ultimate aim of the interinstitutional working group is, through a step-by-step approach, to develop a general agreement between the three EU institutions on the various issues at hand. We hope this can be achieved by the end of this year or the beginning of next year. Cooperation with Parliament has been very positive so far, and we trust that we can count on Parliament's support for the next steps.\nAs you know, EU agencies are legally autonomous bodies whose governance rules are laid down in the funding regulations. In general, agencies are overseen by a governing board whose membership may vary according to the nature of the agency. Three of the agencies in the field of employment and education for example - Eurofund, OSHA and Cedefop - have tripartite governing bodies with representatives of both sides of industry, the Member States and also the Commission.\nI wish to reassure you that this House has access to a lot of information, either because this information is in t", "8. Term of protection of copyright and related rights (\n- Before the vote:\nSharon Bowles\nMr President, I am sorry to trouble colleagues in a long voting session, but it has been newly marked on the voting list that Amendment 80 to a recital falls if Amendment 37 is passed. The first half of the amendment is exactly the same but the new bit - the second part - is consistent. Amendment 81, which is the corresponding amendment to the article, is not marked as falling when the corresponding article amendment, 55, is passed. Therefore, I would request that we vote on Amendment 80 as an addition to 37, if Members like it - which is a different matter - as it looks like we are also doing with Amendment 81.\nPresident\nThank you, Mrs Bowles. It is appropriate that we should hear the opinion of the rapporteur, Mr Crowley.\nBrian Crowley\nrapporteur. - Mr President, I do not think this can be added as an addition. It should be taken separately.\n", "European Institute for Gender Equality (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the recommendation for second reading from the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality on the Council common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a European Institute for Gender Equality (10351/1/2006 - C6 0314/2006 - (Co-rapporteurs: Lissy Gr\u00f6ner, Amalia Sartori)\n\nLissy Gr\u00f6ner \nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, I start with many thanks to my co-rapporteur and to the Commission. We have worked together very well in attempting to get the Institute up and running as soon as possible, and we have been very successful in this. I would, however, ask, Mr President, that all services be again reminded to check that versions of the report in all languages use gender-sensitive language, which is not universally guaranteed in my own language - German - despite repeated calls for this.\nFor as long as the European Parliament has been in existence, we have presented ourselves as an engine of equality. For ten years now, we have been discussing how best to facilitate the establishment of an institution that would pursue gender mainstreaming and draw on the best outcomes from all countries in performing its horizontal task. Following a feasibility study, demands were made for the Gender Institute, to which the Council acceded nearly two years ago now, when it resolved that the Institute would be set up, and on a budget-neutral basis. What does that mean? In practice, it means that the Gender Institute will be funded from what was the gender equality programme. The Budget was halved, and what was left of the programme then became part of the social action programme 'Progress'. Such is the price that women have had to pay. If certain parties are going to claim that the Institute costs too much, the response will have to be that, on the contrary, women have paid a lot for it.\nHere in this House, though, with a great deal of support from women's g", "One-minute speeches on matters of political importance\nPresident\nThe next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.\nTeresa Jim\u00e9nez-Becerril Barrio\n(ES) Mr President, last month, I organised a hearing in this Parliament concerning the victims of terrorism, which was attended by the President of Parliament and various Members of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats).\nThe victims have turned to us, as their representatives in Europe, to guarantee them their right to justice which has been trampled on so many times in their own countries, such as Spain, where the Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero Government continues to lie to the Spanish people about a negotiation process with a terrorist group which has still not relinquished its arms.\nIt is because of this that such grave incidents as the Bar Fais\u00e1n tip off, in which the terrorists were warned of the operation in progress to arrest them, have still not been thoroughly investigated.\nDemocratic governments cannot turn their backs on the victims of terrorism; they have already paid the highest price in the fight for liberty.\nParliament must push for a European Charter which recognises the legitimate demands of the victims, such as not negotiating with terrorists and ensuring that they serve their prison sentences in full.\n\u00c1d\u00e1m K\u00f3sa\n(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during the last working week of the year, I would like to give you a summary of my experience with the administration of the European Parliament. In agreement with the opinion of the European Ombudsman dated 6 December, I would like to say that the team and staff of the European Parliament deserve praise for their work in the advancement of equal opportunities and, in particular, in the improvement of the situation of persons with disabilities. I hope that in the future, there will be no going back on these issues. I would like to thank three people. First, by reason of the adaptation, I would like to thank Mrs Erica Landi and Mr", "Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment in Development Cooperation (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Feleknas Uca, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment in Development Cooperation.\nFeleknas Uca\nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, five days ago we celebrated the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day. Much has been achieved, yet there is still no evidence of equal opportunities in the poorest countries of this world. The human rights of women and of the girl-child are still far from being an unalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights, called for in the United Nations Vienna Declaration of 1993.\nIn my report I dealt in detail with the situation of women and girls in developing countries and I have also looked at ways in which European development cooperation can improve the lives of these women. Let me briefly quote a few facts and figures.\nTwo thirds of all illiterates in the world are women. More than 40% of women in Africa have not attended primary school. In Africa, women make up 52% of the total population but perform 75% of the agricultural work and produce and market 60-80% of the food.\nThe Commission's updated strategy for women's equality and participation in development cooperation addresses important areas and proposes concrete measures to promote equality. The dual approach of the strategy, making gender mainstreaming more efficient and also proposing separate measures to promote equality, is welcome. I also applaud the 41 practical measures in the areas of responsible governance, employment, the economy, education, health and violence against women. Nonetheless, in my report I have criticised several points. Let me discuss the most important ones briefly.\nI believe that combating traditional forms of violence should lie at the heart of the measures to combat violence against women. Secondly, I must say I am rather taken aback", "First railway package (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Michael Cramer, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the implementation of the first railway package\nMichael Cramer \nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressing my deep gratitude to the shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation on the first railway package.\nGenerally speaking, the first railway package can be described as a complete success. The opening of the networks in Europe to rail freight traffic has proved its worth. The countries who have done particularly well are those who prepared themselves for this early on rather than waiting until the networks were opened. For example, Germany has been able to increase rail freight traffic by 25% and the Netherlands by 42.5% since the opening of the networks, and the United Kingdom and Poland have managed to increase the proportion of freight transported by rail by 60% - albeit at a low level in the case of the United Kingdom. This benefits the environment, and it benefits transport in Europe.\nThe countries who did not prepare for this, and waited until the last moment, are not doing so well. For example, France, which did not open up its freight networks until the beginning of this year, saw a 28% decrease in rail freight traffic for the same period. Its volume of road freight traffic has increased - which hardly fits in with prevailing climate policy.\nIn my report, I also discuss the fact that the overall modal split has not changed - the reason for which being, of course, the absence of fair framework conditions between the different modes of transport. Our framework conditions are spectacularly unfair! Transport in Europe could also be described as too cheap, with only rail transport - which is environmentally friendly - being too expensive.\nWe also have unfair subsidy practice: approximately 95% of total EU cofinancing for transport is spent on road transport - not on rail tra", "The economic partnership agreements (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Robert Sturdy, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on Economic Partnership Agreements.\nRobert Sturdy \nrapporteur. - Mr President, this is a particularly important report. The Commission, including the Commissioner himself, and I have worked very closely on it. This report highlights the complexity of establishing a forward programme for trade relations between the EU and the ACP, two very different and largely unequal groups which share a common goal to strengthen trade as a means of real development. Idealistic as this may sound, I have received a great deal of support from both the Commission and the representatives of the ACP regions and, despite the many concerns expressed by NGOs and political groups, they and I, and I am sure the Commission, remain optimistic.\nEPAs have moved very slowly because of the conflicting ideas on a number of issues including regional integration, identification of sensitive products and preparing concrete and detailed proposals for EPA-related support. The ACP has been asked to do a great deal and too often the institutional infrastructure and lack of capacity has raised questions as to whether these proposals will contribute to their development in a manner that they want.\nThe January 2008 deadline is obviously what makes this year so crucial for EPAs. Time is running out. Negotiators must press on to reach a mutually beneficial settlement on EPAs that will help ACP countries develop and support international trade relations. In the event that some regions need more time, I believe it is incumbent on both parties to seek to ensure that ACP exports to the EU should not be harmed. This should be the objective, not discussing the feasibility of another WTO waiver, although I appreciate that the Commission is continuing to focus on reaching the deadlines. However, I am anxious to know what provisions have been outlined for these regions", "Question Time (Council) \nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, I am quite surprised to note that attendance at this question time is as low as it usually is during the night time sittings.\nThe next item is questions to the Council (B7-0462/2010).\nThe following questions have been put to the Council:\nSubject: Foreign policy and defence identity\nWhat action is the Council taking in order to strengthen the EU's foreign policy and defence identity? Even though it is not directly answerable to the EU, does Eurocorps have a role in this in terms of setting an example or taking the lead? What measures are being planned to further improve the EU's external security during the Belgian Presidency?\nOlivier Chastel\nMr President, I am, in any event, delighted to be able to speak on behalf of the Council in front of such great numbers - I refer to our audience in the public gallery.\nThere have been changes in the European policy on security and defence ...\nPresident\nMr Posselt, the procedure is perfectly clear. Mr Chastel answers the question that you put to him in writing and then you have the opportunity to expand the question, to put a subsidiary question, etc. It is now Mr Chastel's responsibility to answer the question as you put it in writing.\nOlivier Chastel\nAs I was saying, the European security and defence policy has undergone a remarkable change and has become one of the most dynamic elements of European integration. Almost 10 years after the creation of the European security and defence policy, which forms an integral part of the common foreign and security policy, the European Union is now a recognised player, in demand on the international scene. The Union's numerous missions around the world are the best proof of this.\nIn fact, the European Union has, at the initiative of the Council and the Member States, deployed 24 military, civilian and civilian-military missions on three continents within the framework of the European Security and Defence Policy. The Union therefore ", "3. Venezuela: the case of Manuel Rosales\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on three motions for resolutions on Venezuela.\nPilar Ayuso\nMadam President, Commissioner, I have signed this resolution and asked to speak in this plenary because I was a witness to the so-called 'expulsion' of our colleague Luis Herrero, which was, in fact, a kidnapping. What is more, I had a chance to see how political persecution, abuses of power by the Ch\u00e1vez regime, intimidation of the opposition, threats, disregard for human dignity and the misuse of justice are all a normal part of life in Venezuela.\nThe case of Manuel Rosales was the last straw and the catalyst for this resolution, but there are thousands of cases just as bloody as his; some of them are quoted in the resolution and others are not, like the case of Eligio Cede\u00f1o who was born in the poor Caracas suburb of Petare, a notoriously dangerous area well known for electing a mayor who was not from the Ch\u00e1vez regime. Eligio was educated with the help of others, in particular, from Citibank; he managed to set up his own business, the Bank of Caracas, and then lived a normal life, also providing help to the most needy. Today, however, he is illegally imprisoned in a Caracas jail following two years of detention with no coherent case being made against him. His only crime was to be a part of the economic oligarchy.\nAnother case is that of Nixon Moreno, a student leader at the University of the Andes, elected to the university council several times and president of the Federation of University Centres. In 2003 he won the Federation election against the current Minister of Interior and Justice, and that is his crime. Today he is accused of attempted murder and lewd violent acts, despite having been exonerated of the accusations.\nCases such as these are a feature of everyday life in Venezuela, where persecution of the opposition with the aim of excluding them from political life and of suppressing dissidents has become part of nor", "2. Laos and Vietnam\nPresident\nThe next item is the four draft resolutions on Laos and Vietnam.\nV\u00e9ronique De Keyser\nMr President, we once again have an urgent debate on Vietnam and Laos. It is true that we have had other similar debates in the European Parliament, but we cannot really allow the current urgent debate to go unheeded.\nWe are, in fact, fairly concerned. Since 2006, when Vietnam was removed from the United States' blacklist for repression and human rights violations, the level of repression against human rights activists has been on the rise.\nI would like to mention just one case which I think is typical, that of Mrs Tran Khai Thanh Thuy. She is a writer, blogger, journalist and activist who is currently in prison for vague reasons, the most plausible of which is that she was defending freedom of expression and human rights in her country. She is diabetic and in a poor state of health. We fear for her life and are demanding not only adequate health care for her in prison, but also her immediate release.\nI love Vietnam. Vietnam is a great country and will take over the presidency of ASEAN in 2010. I believe that adopting measures which are more in line with international democratic standards could only help strengthen its moral authority further.\nThomas Mann\nMr President, the human rights situation in Vietnam is disturbing. Religious persecution, in particular of Christians and Buddhists, is the order of the day. Anyone who speaks out in favour of freedom and human rights is intimidated and kept under systematic surveillance. At the end of September, hundreds of monks from the Bat Nha monastery were attacked. Major damage was caused to the entire monastery complex while the police simply sat by and watched. The monks who sought refuge in the nearby Phuoc Hue temple were beaten up. This sort of abuse must not be tolerated. It is outrageous that the numerous calls from the European Union and other parts of the world for improvements in the human rights situa", "EC-Serbia Stabilisation and Association Agreement - Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EC and Serbia (debate) \nPresident\nThe first item on the agenda is the joint debate on the EC-Serbia Agreement\nEC-Serbia Stabilisation and Association Agreement. Recommendation by Jelko Kacin, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Recommendation on the draft Council and Commission decision on the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Serbia, of the other part [15619/1/2007 - C7-0341/2010 - 2007/0255(NLE)]\nStabilisation and Association Agreement between the EC and Serbia. Council and Commission statements\nJelko Kacin\nMadam President, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and Serbia was signed in April 2008, and the transitional, interim trade agreement with Serbia has been successfully implemented since February 2010.\nThe ratification process began in September 2008 when the Serbian Parliament first ratified this agreement.\nThe agreement provides a political, legal and economic framework for cooperation between the European Union and Serbia, and Serbia was unable to continue along the path of European integration without the ratification process getting under way.\nIn 2009, there were no reports of Serbia on the European Parliament's agenda because the ratification process in the Member States stalled following Serbia's failure to cooperate fully with the Hague-based International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). To date, eleven Member States have ratified this agreement, which is why, today, I call on the remaining Member States to do the same as soon as possible.\nIf, today, we ratify the agreement in this higher assembly, we will be sending a strong and visible message of support for Serbia's European efforts. That alone, however, will not ensure a successful completion of the ratification pr", "Agenda\nPresident\nIn view of recent developments in the situation and by agreement with the political groups, I would like to propose the following changes to the order of business on Wednesday. They are new changes in relation to those we adopted yesterday at 17.30. They are additional changes.\nFirstly, we are withdrawing Question Time with the Council from the order of business. The Council has informed me that in connection with the transport difficulties being experienced this week, Mr L\u00f3pez Garrido will have to leave Strasbourg on Wednesday at 18.00, so we will not be able to have Question Time in the evening. Secondly, we are withdrawing from the order of business Mrs \u0162ic\u00e3u's report on the energy performance of buildings, because it was not adopted in committee on Monday. Thirdly, we are entering an oral question on the ban on the use of cyanide mining technologies as the third item on the agenda in the afternoon immediately after the debates on SWIFT and PNR (this is about passenger name records). In this way, the sitting on Wednesday will close at 19.00. I will say this again, very briefly: we have withdrawn those items which are not possible and, as a result, we will end Wednesday's sitting not at 24.00, but at 19.00. I repeat that these matters have been consulted with the chairs of the political groups.\nPaul R\u00fcbig\n(DE) Mr President, I simply want to ask whether sittings will still be taking place in the House on Thursday, whether committees such as Scientific Technology Options Assessment (STOA) and others will be meeting, whether interpreters will be available for the sittings, and whether groups of visitors will be admitted to the House on Thursday.\nPresident\nI am just preparing an e-mail to all Members, which I will sign in person. Some of us have not even reached Strasbourg and also want to have this information. The e-mail will be sent at around 11.00 and will contain answers to as many of the questions as possible to which we already know the answers", "\n\n(1) \nPoignant (PSE ).\n\u00a0\u00a0  Mr President, I rise to speak on statements made in France by one of the Members of this House, Mr Gollnisch. I would like to give two or three examples of remarks which he has recently made; \u2018there is not a serious historian alive today who adheres completely to the conclusions of the Nuremberg trial\u2019, \u2018as to the existence of the gas chambers, that is up to the historians to determine\u2019, and \u2018I question the number of victims of the Holocaust\u2019. Such comments cannot be allowed to go unchallenged, and I would ask you, Mr President, to refer the matter to the Bureau. These comments, made by a Member of Parliament, are an attack on the values which formed a basis for the construction of both the EU itself and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, as included in the Constitutional Treaty. I should like to say from the outset that if a debate were to be held on parliamentary immunity as a result of the legal proceedings which cannot fail to be instigated, I would be in favour of waiving this immunity. \nSchulz (PSE ).\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013 Mr President, I have a request to make of you. Yesterday, the Conference of Presidents, which both Mr Watson and I attended, decided to ask the President of Parliament, Mr Borrell, to forward to the President-designate of the Commission, Mr Barroso, the letters from the various committees of this House containing the outcomes of the hearings, so that he could take note of them and draw his own conclusions from them. I read in yesterday\u2019s evening newspapers and in yesterday evening\u2019s press agency reports that Mr Barroso, even though these letters are not yet in his possession, is already making statements about the outcomes of the hearings, to the effect that he is not interested in what the letters contain, regards \u2013 in as many words \u2013 his own Commission as perfectly suitable, and is unwilling to make any changes. I would ask you, Mr President, to ensure that Mr Barroso is given to understand that my group is no longer prepared to", "8. The Single Market Review (vote) \n- Report: Jacques Toubon\nMonica Frassoni\n(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I had asked to speak on an issue connected with our work schedule: the fact that the new school year has coincided for some years, and will unfortunately coincide again next year, with our plenary poses major family problems for our Members and for many of our officials. In my view, this is a question that Parliament should debate, because the well-being of our children, who should be taken to school by their parents, is a matter that it behoves this Parliament to address.\n(Applause)\nPresident\nThank you, Mrs Frassoni, I am sure you have a good point, but you were late for assembly, so see the headmaster, please!\n(Laughter)\nThomas Wise\nMr President, I do not know what rule this is under, but my voting list has another report to be voted on - Ayala Sender. Do we reconvene at 12.30 p.m.?\nPresident\nThe debate has not taken place and the vote will be tomorrow. Thank you for raising that point.\n", "\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 7 July 2005. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Please allow me next to make a statement relating to the events we have witnessed this summer.\nAs you will remember, on 7 July, at our last sitting before the holidays, we were taken by surprise by the terrorist attacks on London, which, as we feared at the time, caused many victims. Europe continues to be threatened by terrorism and this is a problem to which we must attach special importance in view of the events of July and those which followed.\nThis summer, however, has also been marked by other tragic events: the persistence of terrorism in Iraq, horrendous natural disasters and accidents that have brought pain to many families throughout the world \u2014 particularly here in Europe and now, especially, in the United States.\nYou must be aware that, during this summer, whenever one of these events has taken place, I have immediately expressed our solidarity and made contact with the countries affected by these dramas on behalf of the European Parliament. Every time they have happened we have made our voice heard.\nI also believe that we should all join together today to share the pain of the families of the victims of these events, of those who have lost their loved ones in the deadly conflicts affecting the planet. The United States deserve special mention, since they are currently experiencing a drama of extraordinary dimensions which is shocking the whole world. It appears that there will be many many victims, thousands of people have been displaced and enormous damage has been done, both in economic terms, and to the social structure.\nIn Iraq, terrorism kills many people everyday, in a constant drip. A rumour alone is enough, as was the case a few weeks ago, when panic on a bridge in Baghdad led to the deaths of more than a thousand people.\nDramatic civilian aeroplane and helicopter accidents have led to the deaths of more than 400 people in In", "\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 23 June 2005. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Ladies and gentlemen, a terrible tragedy has struck the family of our fellow Member Filip Adwent: as you know, he, his daughter, his father and his mother died in a traffic accident on Saturday 18 June. Parliament has lost a colleague, an excellent Member of Parliament, a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, vice-chairman of the Delegation to the Parliamentary Committee on EU-Ukraine Cooperation and deputy in the Committee on Transport and Tourism. I believe that all of those who have worked with him in these committees and all of us in general remember his serious work and his dedication to Parliament.\nFilip Adwent was a doctor by profession. He was known for his sense of justice and the conviction with which he fought for what he believed in. For many years he participated in the organisation of humanitarian aid for the poor and disadvantaged in Poland. At this painful moment, Parliament would like to express its condolences to his wife, Mrs Adwent, and the whole of his family \u2014 the remaining members of his family.\nI would ask, ladies and gentlemen, that we observe a minute\u2019s silence in memory of our colleague.\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0  Ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to make a further statement relating to certain events of this weekend.\nOn reaching the Chamber, you may have been surprised to see that there is a large white band encircling the Chamber.\nI believe that this is the first time that we have used a symbol in this building for a campaign, such a large symbol, and I would like to tell you a few details about the significance of this white band.\nI would like to remind you that this band symbolises the \u2018Global Call to Action against Poverty\u2019 which was launched by the President of Brazil, Mr da Silva, in Porto Alegre, in January 2005.\nSince then, more than 600 non-governmental organisations throughout the world, in", "Credit Rating Agencies - Reporting and documentation requirements in the case of merger and divisions - Insurance and reinsurance (Solvency II) (recast) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on:\nthe report by Mr Gauz\u00e8s, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Credit Rating Agencies - C6-0397/2008 -,\nthe report by Mrs Weber, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directives 77/91/EEC, 78/855/EEC and 82/891/EEC and Directive 2005/56/EC as regards reporting and documentation requirements in the case of merger and divisions - C6-0330/2008 -, and\nthe report by Mr Skinner, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the amended proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (recast) - C6-0231/2007 -.\nJean-Paul Gauz\u00e8s\nMadam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on rating agencies with which I have been entrusted has been particularly interesting to draft, and I am delighted, above all, that we have been able to reach an agreement with the Council and with the Commission so that this report has a chance of being adopted at first reading.\nAnalysing the various causes of the financial crisis has shown that there was an urgent need to enact legislation on rating agencies. The proposal for a regulation submitted by the Commission has been examined very carefully by Parliament in order to ensure that European legislation is at once exemplary, effective and pragmatic.\nThe recent conclusions of the G20 have further strengthened this determination. The compromise reached by the Commission, the EU Presidency and Parliament adheres to the guidelines sought by Parliament on the essential points of this regulation: the scope, the rati", "3. The future of VAT (\nDavid Casa\nrapporteur. - Mr President, paragraph 13 is completely covered by part of paragraph 9, and to remove the repetition I would like to propose an oral amendment to delete paragraph 13. I am informed that other groups are in favour of this amendment.\n", "Welcome\nPresident\nI have the pleasure of telling you that, in the framework of interparliamentary meetings, a Mauritanian delegation, led by Mr Ould Tolba, is currently visiting the European Parliament. I would like to wish our guests a warm welcome and emphasise the importance we place on such a visit, the first in Europe for almost 10 years.\nThrough its election observation missions the European Union has been paying close attention to the recent political transition in Mauritania, which could set an example for the region. We congratulate you on the democratic election of your Head of State and Parliament and, on behalf of this Parliament, I hope that your meetings here are fruitful and that your visit to Strasbourg can actively contribute to bringing our two institutions closer together. Thank you once again for your visit.\n", "Amendment of the Rules of Procedure (committees, quaestors) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Jo Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on amendment of Rules 15 and 182(1) of Parliament's Rules of Procedure - Election of Quaestors and committee bureaux.\nRichard Corbett \ndeputising for the rapporteur. - Mr President, I should like to begin by giving the apologies of the rapporteur, Mr Leinen, who could not be here tonight because he has to represent Parliament in a far-away part of the world. He is on his way there as I speak.\nI rise to propose, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, an amendment to our Rules of Procedure, which would see a fourth vice-chairman elected in each parliamentary committee, a bureau of four instead of three, and a College of Quaestors comprising six members instead of five.\nWhy has such a proposal come forward at this stage? It arises from an amendment to our Rules tabled by just two Members of the European Parliament - Mr Schulz and Mr Poettering - who considered that this would facilitate the participation of Members of Parliament from across 27 Member States - as we will be in January - in positions of responsibility in Parliament. It would be a measure that would be inclusive, that would enable more Members to hold positions of responsibility, and that would make it easier to distribute such posts politically across Parliament.\nWe took cognisance of that proposal in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. It is a very important consideration. We also heard that there were strong arguments against creating what many considered to be an inflation of Parliamentary posts. There is, after all, no functional necessity to have a larger bureau of each parliamentary committee. Perhaps - although that is more debatable - there is no functional necessity to have a larger College of Quaestors. It was pointed out by many colleagues that we have enough positions of responsibility across this Pa", "10. Protection of animals used for scientific purposes (\n- Before the vote:\nNeil Parish\nrapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs who have been very willing to work with me on what is an incredibly technical and difficult dossier. By working together we have been able to come up with what, I believe, is a good compromise.\nAnimal testing is a highly controversial and emotional area which does involve a moral dilemma. We have done our best to create a position which will improve welfare for animals used for testing and, at the same time, ensure that top-quality and reliable medical research can continue within Europe. We have built upon the Commission's proposal in many areas and, most importantly, we have clarified the severity classifications. We had a good compromise in the Agriculture Committee and it should not be picked apart at this stage.\nWe all want to work together to refine, reduce and replace animal testing. However, we must remember that many vaccines and cures for diseases have been developed using animals, and especially primates - for example, vaccines for polio, diphtheria, hepatitis B, along with deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease. All are examples of the benefits of animal research. To allay concerns that many Members have with the use of embryonic stem cells, Amendment 170, if supported, will ensure that ethical decisions on this issue are made by Member States themselves and not by the Commission.\nWe have a huge opportunity here to improve legislation for animal welfare and research. We should put our party differences aside and support this report. Industry, medical research and animal welfare organisations are convinced that this is a step forward and that we will update and improve the current legislation. If we do not deal with it in this Parliament, the legislation could be put back by a further two years or more, which would be a retrograde step. I urge Members of the House to support this repor", "5. Getting a grip on energy prices (vote) \n- Before the vote on Amendment 1\nUrszula Gacek\nMr President, I have a genuine point of order with respect to the new Rules of Procedure. We have been told that, because debate has been curtailed, we can now put in more written statements over the single written statement we were able to do before the new Rules came into effect. Today I tried to submit two written statements, and the internet site will not allow it. So my voice in the debate for controlling energy has not been noted anywhere.\nCan you make sure the technical problem is solved? The revised Rules of Procedure are not being adhered to.\nPresident\nYou can submit a written declaration, Mrs Gacek, but that was not the right time to raise the point.\n", "Results of the G20 summit (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on the results of the G20 summit.\nOlivier Chastel\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, honourable Members, the Presidency of the Council and the European Parliament already had the opportunity to discuss the G20 on 20 October 2010; at the time we were on the eve of the ministerial meeting of the G20 and were waiting to see how things would develop in Seoul.\nAs Europeans, we were well prepared for these meetings, both at ministerial level and at the level of Heads of State or Government. We realised that the lack of cohesion among Europeans would rapidly lead us to exhaust the European Union's credibility on the international stage. It has to be said that the Seoul Summit received mixed reactions from around the world. For my part, I believe that we should continue to be optimistic despite everything, even if the results were not as impressive as we would have hoped.\nBefore the Seoul Summit, we were convinced that the toughest and most important test was going to be maintaining our momentum. We should not make the mistake of thinking that we no longer need global cooperation, with the excuse that we are no longer in the critical situation we were in 18 months ago, or even six months ago. We still believe that political leaders are responsible for making decisions. They are, and that is indeed the essence of politics. However, I think they also have another, even more important responsibility: making sure that decisions do not remain on paper, but have concrete results and are fully implemented.\nThe Seoul Summit showed that the real challenge for the G20, and therefore for all of us, is understanding how we should continue with and indeed accelerate implementation. We have to turn good intentions into practical results, and all of that is important for at least two reasons. First of all, the markets are not satisfied with statements alone. They are ", "1. The humanitarian situation in Gaza (vote) \n- Motion for a resolution: the humanitarian situation in Gaza\n- Before the vote on paragraph 5:\nCharles Tannock\nMadam President, I would like to add the words 'the State of' before Israel in paragraph 5. The reason for this is that some Members, including Mr Davies, inform me that Hamas recognises Israel, but not the State of Israel. It is the State of Israel that needs recognition.\n(The oral amendment was accepted)\n", "Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting\nPresident.\n The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nMombaur (PPE-DE).\nMr President, the Minutes wrongly state that, following the report on, and description of, the attack on Mrs Kla\u00df, I had simply called on the President to take disciplinary steps. Although true, that is only half the truth. In addition, I publicly called on him to lay charges before the responsible law enforcement agencies against the employees of this House who made themselves liable to criminal proceedings for failing to give assistance when Mrs Kla\u00df was attacked. I request that the Minutes be amended accordingly.\n\nPresident.\nMr Mombaur, I myself witnessed both Mrs Kla\u00df's joinder of issue and your own. I do indeed recall that you raised this point about the failure to provide assistance. I can inform you and the House that the Bureau considered this case yesterday and that there will be a written report, which will lay bare all the matters connected with it. I therefore request my small staff here to add to the Minutes - page 17 in the German version - what Mr Mombaur said about this matter of the failure to provide assistance.\n(Parliament approved the Minutes of the previous sitting.)\n\nPresident.\nThe next item is the report (A5-0162/2002) by Mr Herv\u00e9 Novelli on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the proposal for a Council Regulation (COM(2001) 423 - C5-0438/2001 - 2001/0172(CNS)) on State aid to the coal industry.\n\nNovelli (ELDR)\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission proposal to the Council of 25 July 2001 on State aid to the coal industry has a certain number of good qualities and one slight defect.\nThe first of the good qualities is the fact that it is essential. The second is that it really is an important step in the right direction for the coal industry. The slight defect is that it contains a certain number of inaccuracies which have not been removed at the com", "Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes for yesterday have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nJos\u00e9 Ribeiro e Castro\n(FR) Madam President, I ask the Members to allow me to take up a few minutes of their time.\nI would like to speak on the subject of China. There was a motion for a resolution for today on China, on the case of Mr Gao Zhisheng, a well-known lawyer who is under arrest. There are fears that he will be tortured; his family has just been allowed entry to the United States and there are fears for his life.\nUnfortunately, though, as only three subjects may be dealt with, the motion relating to Mr Gao Zhisheng could not be included. We did intend to move it in the March II session. Now, we have been told that there will be no urgent matters in March II because, according to the rules, when there are two plenary sessions in the same month, there can be no urgent matters in the second.\nI question this interpretation. In fact, this interpretation refers to the double sessions in September and, prior to that, in October, during which the budget was discussed. The fact that there are two sessions in March is due to the elections; it is a totally exceptional case. This means that we can only deal with human rights issues at the end of April, which is too late.\nI therefore ask the Presidency, first, to examine this question and, secondly, to express our immense concern about the case to the Chinese embassy - I can provide you with Mr Gao Zhisheng's case for this purpose - as nobody really knows his whereabouts and there are fears that he may be tortured and his life put in danger.\n", "Ensuring food quality: harmonisation or mutual recognition of standards (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is a short presentation of the report by Mrs Petre, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on ensuring food quality: harmonisation or mutual recognition of standards.\nMaria Petre\nrapporteur. - (RO) I would first of all like to thank the European Commission for this welcome initiative of the Green Paper on agricultural product quality and for the consultation launched on this topic.\nThe Green Paper provides a response to a real need on the part of Member States to promote the image of their agricultural products, especially the benefits in terms of quality, both among European consumers and consumers in other countries. These high standards are demanded by consumers and are a means of achieving maximum added value. Although the codecision procedure does not apply, I hope that the European Parliament's opinion will definitely be taken into consideration during the phases to come.\nI would also like to thank my colleagues from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and, especially, the experts for the support they have given in promoting this report.\nSimplification of marketing standards, keeping consumers better informed, particularly about the origin of food products, and better protection for European quality products at a global level are some of the most important proposals in the report.\nQuality policy cannot be treated separately from the issue of the future of the CAP or from such challenges as climate change, the need to preserve biodiversity, energy supplies and water resource management. At the same time, consumers, as we all know, are showing an ever-increasing interest not only in food safety but also in the origin and production methods of food products.\nCertification schemes are associated in the minds of consumers with a guarantee of higher quality. The purpose of standards must be to assist farmers i", "Type-approval requirements for the general safety of motor vehicles (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Schwab, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning type-approval requirements for the general safety of motor vehicles - C6-0210/2008 -.\nAndreas Schwab\nMadam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start - and not for the sake of formalities but out of genuine feeling on my part - by offering my heartfelt thanks to Commissioner Verheugen, the Commission, its staff, the Czech Presidency, which is unfortunately unable to be with us today, and those on the committee for their positive and constructive cooperation on this dossier.\nIf you look into how environmentally-friendly measures for cars can be achieved, you are sometimes surprised that so much time is spent looking into other measures. I think that we, as Parliament, as a European body, have together taken an important step forwards that has not, so far, really managed to demonstrate its importance to the general public or in the political debate.\nThe regulation that we are passing today is environmentally friendly since, as part of the CO2 package, it represents an important contribution, on the part of European policy, to the reduction in CO2 emissions from motor vehicles. At the same time, however - and I would call this clever environmental policy - it also helps consumers - drivers - to pay less while, at the same time, acting in an environmentally-friendly manner, as it leads to considerable savings, not only in terms of CO2, but also in terms of the consumption of petrol and diesel. In addition, it also - and this, too, is an important point that was particularly important to Parliament and its Members - leads to improvements in the safety of European roads, and not only in relation to goods vehicles, but in relation to cars as well.\nI have no ", "Energy and climate change (introduction) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on climate change and energy.\nJean-Louis Borloo\nMadam President, Commissioner, Group Chairmen, chairmen, rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen.\nI am back with you a few weeks - a very few weeks - after our last debate, and in particular following an important moment, when a confidence pact was made between Parliament and the Council, under the watchful eye of the Commission, in order to seek, unanimously, as President Sarkozy was saying this morning, a series of mechanisms that will commit the economies of the 27 countries to a sustainable economy, to reduce CO2 emissions, to prepare for Copenhagen, and to improve and prepare the competitiveness of our economies for the coming century.\nI am back with you following a European Council that reached a unanimous decision, and I feel that we have not betrayed this confidence pact sealed between us, thanks to the many and various trialogues, which were more or less unprecedented; I am thinking of last weekend's trialogue on a number of directives. I also feel that, compared with the situation when we met a month ago, the discrepancies are very easy to identify.\nThere is no discrepancy if Copenhagen is a success. There is added value if Copenhagen is not a success, in other words if only Europe is committed. The efforts demanded of industry include making the most environmentally effective technologies more competitive.\nThe second area of added value concerns solidarity and the third concerns energy. Energy and allocations to energy are one of the main principles of this package, along with renewable energy, cars, and so on.\nOn this subject, I think that in our hearts we can all accept having a transition period for the economies that have the most coal, given that we know how complicated transitions are from a social point of view. Having experienced them in a number of our countries - in Belgium, in the Nord-Pas-de Calai", "Order of business\nPresident\nThe final draft agenda drawn up on Wednesday, 10 February 2010 by the Conference of Presidents pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.\nBy agreement with the political groups, I would like to propose the following changes:\nThursday:\nConcerning the sitting on Thursday, the Group of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has submitted a request to hold over the vote on the report by Mr Lehne on annual accounts of certain types of companies as regards micro-entities.\nMartin Schulz\nMr President, our group had a very intensive debate on the Lehne report this morning. We did not finish discussing this in the group. That happens in groups sometimes. We would like Mr Lehne, as rapporteur, to give us until the March part-session to once more consider the direction we can go with this report and the stance that we as Social Democrats want to take with regard to this issue. There are different approaches in our group - I freely admit this.\nI would be grateful if we could conduct the debate, but if you, Mr Lehne, would allow us to postpone the vote until the first March part-session. That would give my group at least - although I believe other groups too - a little more time for a thorough debate and to arrive at an opinion.\nKlaus-Heiner Lehne\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is good that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament are looking at this in detail. However, I would like to say that Parliament adopted a resolution almost unanimously in December 2008 in which we called on the European Commission to submit precisely the sort of proposal that we are now discussing. Parliament must also stick to what it has itself decided and what has been the declared intention of this House for years.\nBecause it is only natural for there to be concerns about one thing or another in connection with any legislative proposal, we have resolved the open quest", "Sri Lanka (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka.\nMarie Anne Isler B\u00e9guin\n(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs for agreeing to accept the procedure laid down in Article 91 and to put this emergency resolution on last Monday's agenda, since, at our last plenary here, in Strasbourg, we already had an emergency resolution on this issue of Sri Lanka. I would also like to thank Parliament for having agreed to this debate taking place this evening, and I thank you, Commissioner, for coming to this debate, as I know the time is difficult for you.\nWe wanted this resolution because we have to send a strong political signal to the government and the Tamil representatives in Sri Lanka, because the situation is getting worse every day. We have first hand accounts from Tamil families and people who are in Europe and who are always sending us messages and accounts of what is happening to them and what is happening to their families trapped in the conflict between the Tamil Tigers and the Sri Lankan army. These people are enduring really terrible suffering.\nWe do not know how many people are affected, but we estimate that between 150 and 200 000 people need to be evacuated. What is meant by 'evacuated', though? The NGOs are asking us to have them evacuated by sea, but, there again, I have to ask: to go where? Where are these people going to go?\nThis afternoon, I met a little girl who was born in a Sri Lankan refugee camp and who is now in Europe. If it is that these people have to leave their country to go and live in refugee camps, then that is not the solution, either.\nTherefore, we are asking in this resolution for there to be an actual ceasefire. Of course, there will be debate with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democ", "1. Sudan and the International Criminal Court (ICC) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Sudan and the International Criminal Court.\nJean Lambert\nauthor. - Madam President, once again we are returning to the topic of Sudan and what can be done to call the Government there to account for the suffering of the people of that country, and indeed for the effects on neighbouring states.\nThis afternoon's resolution particularly concerns the International Criminal Court, and the fact that, over a year ago now, two arrest warrants were issued by that Court for Ahmad Haroun, the Minister of the Interior at the time, who is now the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs - which I think many of us find deeply shocking - and also for one of the former Janjaweed militia leaders, Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman.\nWe have seen absolutely no cooperation from the Sudanese Government in handing these people over to the International Criminal Court, although that Government is well aware that membership of the United Nations carries with it obligations. We are seeing an ongoing culture of impunity, where nobody is ever brought to account, it seems, for the most appalling crimes.\nWe consider that all governments should be taking a strong stance on this, and the resolution says that we should be calling on the General Affairs and External Relations Council in June to adopt targeted EU punitive measures against a clearly identified group of Sudanese officials who bear responsibility for this non-cooperation, with that action including clear financial sanctions - it appears that when the cries of people do not work, maybe stopping the flow of money will.\nMy group commends this resolution to the House. We look forward to firm action and hopefully seeing these men, and others, brought to justice.\nErik Meijer\nauthor. - (NL) Madam President, a year ago we also had an urgent debate about Sudan. Since then the situation has become worse, not better. The agree", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 28 November 1996.\n\nTribute\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, I am sorry to have to tell you that Alain Poher died this morning.\nAlain Poher was a Member of this Parliament from the time when it was first created, in 1952. He went on to occupy various positions of office until the year 1978. Amongst other things he was the chairman of the Christian Democrat Group, and then from March 1966 until March 1969 he served as President of the European Parliament. He then went on to preside over the fortunes of the French Senate. Throughout his life, Alain Poher was one of the most enthusiastic promoters of the construction of Europe. He was indefatigable in its defence, drawing political lessons from the catastrophic events of the Second World War.\nOn behalf of the European Parliament, and at a personal level too, I should like to express my sincere condolences to Alain Poher's family and also to the authorities of the French Republic.\nI should now like to ask you to show your respect by observing a minute's silence.\n(The House rose and observed one minute's silence)\n\nApproval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of the last sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n(Parliament approved the Minutes)\n\nPasty\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, could I please have your attention for a moment.\nLast Tuesday, my country was plunged into mourning following a dreadful, cowardly attack. That attack left four people dead: a French citizen, a Canadian citizen, and two Moroccan students. Once again, an act of barbarism has been committed on European soil.\nI am reminding you of these facts because, implicitly, I want to prevent terrorism from becoming, as it were, trivialized. Several European countries are steeped in blood as a result of terrorism: Spain, the United Kingdom, Ireland and France. We must show clearly our determination to stamp out this evil. In or", "Non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is Council and Commission statements on non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament.\nG\u00fcnter Gloser\nMr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and of the means of delivering them has the potential to present what is perhaps the greatest risk to international security, and that is why the European Union, in its comprehensive strategy for combating them, which dates back to 2003, stressed that, in this area, the best way of maintaining security and international order was a multilateral approach combining disarmament and non-proliferation on an equal footing. So, then, the Treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is, and remains, the fundamental cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. The European Union endorses the provisions of the NPT and advocates and endorses measures aimed at further reinforcing them.\nThinking forward to the first meeting of the committee preparing the conference on the review of this treaty in 2010, the European Union has already started to do extensive preparatory work at home. We are firmly determined to continue, in 2007, to play an active and constructive role in the debates at the preparatory conference, and since our intention is that the European Union should begin the review cycle in a constructive atmosphere, it is strongly endorsing the plans put forward by the Japanese ambassador Amano, who has been appointed as the chairman of the first preparatory committee.\nThe European Union takes the view that all three pillars of the Non-Proliferation Treaty - those being nuclear non-proliferation, disarmament, and the peaceful use of nuclear energy - must be considered and held in balance in the review debate. It is that sort of even-handedness alone that will make it possible for the forthcoming review cycle of the Non-Proliferation Treaty to progress successfully, and it is on that, thou", "Israel's participation in Community programmes - Israel's participation in Community programmes (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is a joint debate on:\nthe report by Mrs De Keyser, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of a Protocol to the Euro Mediterranean Association Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States of the one part and the State of Israel of the other part, on a Framework Agreement between the European Community and the State of Israel on the general principles governing the State of Israel's participation in Community programmes (05471/2008 - C6-0180/2008 - and\nCouncil and Commission statements concerning the State of Israel's participation in Community programmes.\nV\u00e9ronique De Keyser\nrapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, we asked in plenary for the vote to be deferred, and I am delighted about that, but, as rapporteur, I feel I need to explain myself.\nAs Mr Salafranca pointed out earlier, it is quite correct that, on 6 November, Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted two proposals on Israel's participation in Community programmes: one was an assent, and the other a resolution. Both proposals were adopted by a huge majority - the vote on the resolution was actually unanimous.\nWhat did these texts contain, and what message did the Committee on Foreign Affairs wish to send Israel? The assent was positive: it agreed to Israel's participation in the Community programme, given that it was already participating in the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, that its application related solely to the 'innovation and technology' programme, that all member countries of the neighbourhood policy are entitled to apply to participate, and thus that it constituted neither a special favour to Israel nor a reassessment of its political status.\nThe association agreements are based on respect for human rights. Members therefore wanted to provide ", "8. Non-discrimination based on gender and inter-generational solidarity (\nZbigniew Zaleski\n(ES) Mr President, I would like to make a minor linguistic, and perhaps semantic, observation.\n(PL) Paragraph A contains the wording '...and recognising the diversity of 21st century family patterns...' rendered in other languages as 'a tak\u017ce uznaj\u0105c r\u00f3\u017cnorodno\u015b\u0107 wzorc\u00f3w rodziny...' '...en reconnaissant la diversit\u00e9 de sch\u00e9mas familiaux...' '...Anerkennung der Vielfalt der Familienmodels...'. If this is to be understood as acceptance of diversity along with a model of a single sex family, if that was indeed what Mrs Z\u00e1borsk\u00e1 intended, then I shall vote against it. I would welcome clarification as to whether this is simply about noting that such models have been observed, or whether it is about recognising and accepting them. We need to understand what we are voting on.\nAnna Z\u00e1borsk\u00e1\nThank you, Mr President and Mr Zaleski. Of course, in this context we recognise other models.\nPresident\nIt is clear then, Mr Zaleski: we note that they exist.\n", "3. Modalities of Iceland and Norway's participation in the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (vote) \n", "Reducing health inequalities (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Estrela, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on reducing health inequalities in the EU.\nEdite Estrela\nMr President, I should like to begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation and the work that we did together, as well as thanking the rapporteurs for the opinions of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. All the contributions were very useful.\nHealth inequalities vary from country to country and from region to region. They are linked to economic and social conditions and can be exacerbated because of gender or culture. In other words, health inequalities are not just related to access to healthcare, but also to factors as different as living conditions, housing, education, profession, income and lifestyle. Although there has been some progress, major inequalities within the 27 Member States still persist. For example, according to Eurostat, life expectancy at birth for men varied by 14.2 years between EU Member States in 2007, while among women it was 8.3 years. Health and life expectancy are still linked to social conditions and poverty, and when poverty is combined with other forms of vulnerability, such as childhood or old age, disability or minority background, the risks of health inequalities increase further.\nHealth inequalities can start during childhood, continue until old age and be passed from generation to generation, hence, the importance of this matter and the urgent need to find a solution. The current situation of global crisis tends to make the situation worse. As is obvious, the crisis is having a severe impact on the health sector in a number of Member States, in terms of both supply and demand. On the supply side, the crisis may lead to a reduction in the level of funding for public health, at the same time as ", "Statement by the President\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, the Kosovo Parliament declared Kosovo's independence yesterday. This decision was expected and reflects the will of the citizens in Kosovo to take their political fate and institutional shaping of independence peacefully into their own hands.\nAbout a year ago, the European Parliament, as a consequence of the Ahtisaari report, agreed on the supervised sovereignty of Kosovo. The negotiations between Belgrade and Pri\u0161tina were extremely difficult and regrettably did not lead to a solution which was acceptable politically to all participants. As so often in politics, there was no magic formula. The heavy burden of recent history contributed to this situation. However, the case of Kosovo is not a precedent. The situation of Kosovo as a UN protectorate is unique and is a special case which cannot be compared with others.\nI would like to call upon all those involved and appeal to them for reason and calm. I am sure that everyone in Kosovo - Serbs and Kosovans -wishes to achieve stability and prosperity in their region. Indeed, that is the primary objective of the European Union and the European Parliament. It is our task and duty to encourage the political leaders in Kosovo to assume their responsibilities and to create democratic political institutions which respect the rights and freedoms of all citizens in the context of a multiethnic Kosovo which lives in good-neighbourly relations with its neighbours.\nIn that connection, I also welcome the decision by the Council to send the EULEX Kosovo mission led by Yves de Kermabon. The task of the mission will be to provide assistance to the Kosovans in the field of policing and the rule of law to ensure a smooth transition.\nI also welcome the appointment of Pieter Feith as EU Special Representative in Kosovo. This demonstrates the European Union's clear and resolute commitment and our will to do something practical for lasting stability in the Balkans.\nI trust in the wis", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any objections.\n\nMiller\nMr President, my point concerns the Minutes. I refer to an intervention by Mr Macartney in which he said there had been some confusion and an error in translation from the original version in French into English. I have checked the original French version and it quite clearly states 'la viande britannique' . My understanding is that 'britannique' means British, it does not mean English, and therefore it includes all British beef including Scottish beef.\n\nMacartney\nMr President, I appreciate my colleague's concern for linguistic accuracy but as you know the President in the Chair at the time was David Martin who is also from Scotland. We have checked the original version signed by the group and it said 'anglaise' . That is why I raised the point of order, just for the record.\n\nPresident\nThank you. I think we have looked at all the details of this question, and so the facts of this matter must now be clear.\n(The Minutes were approved)\n\nDecision on urgency\nKittelmann\nMr President, The Committee on External Economic Relations requests that you reject the urgency application. The Commission asked on 17 November for an urgent priority according to article 97. The Committee on External Economic Relations debated the application at a session on 18 November, and rejected it unanimously on grounds both of procedure and content. The following concerns the procedure followed. At the time of the application for urgent priority the Committee was in possession only of a copy of the covering sheet to the basic document containing the Commission's proposal. Under such circumstances we cannot be expected to give a Commission proposal serious consideration, however urgent it may appear to be. Despite this, it would be possible to make an exception for the Ukraine on financial grounds, but as a tranche of ECU 100 million was to be made available, we do not belie", "\nSimpson\nMadam President, I am grateful to you for giving me the floor. I want to bring to your attention and that of Parliament the tragic and terrible rail crash that took place yesterday just outside Paddington Station in London, in which two trains collided. At the moment the death toll is at 26 but is expected to rise - maybe even to double that - and there are many people seriously injured.\nI therefore request, President, that you write a letter on behalf of the European Parliament to the British Prime Minister expressing our shock and horror at the magnitude of this terrible disaster, asking him to and pass on our deepest sympathy to the relatives of those people who have died, and also to the relatives of those who remain seriously injured in the hope that they make a full recovery.\nI would be grateful, in light of this terrible rail disaster, if you would do that.\n\nPresident\nYes, Mr Simpson, I have myself heard the news of this terrible accident and I agree completely with your suggestion. I shall write on behalf of all of us, if you agree, to express our deepest sympathy to those who have suffered in this disaster.\n\nState of relations between Turkey and the EU\nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the state of relations between Turkey and the European Union.\nI have received 6 motions for resolution laid down pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.\n\nSasi\nMadam President, Members of the European Parliament, Turkey is, economically, socially and culturally, a key partner of the European Union. Turkey also has, and will have, an important role to play in maintaining peace and stability in our continent. This has once again been proven with the recent events in the Balkans.\nIt is clear that the Union and Turkey need one another. The importance of that cooperation was underlined four years ago, when the Customs Union became effective. It is our belief that the Customs Union has benefited both sides. Last year, EU", "1. Burma\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution on Burma.\nLaima Liucija Andrikien \nauthor. - (LT) Through this discussion and the resolution to be voted on in a short while, the European Parliament calls the human rights situation in Burma to the attention of the EU Member States, the other EU institutions and the international community. The country is often called a paradise for tourists, but is far from a paradise for the people living there. The last provocation by the ruling regime against its citizens was last month's 500 percent increase in fuel prices. No wonder such a decision has evoked dissatisfaction and public protests, which have been, and are still being, brutally suppressed. Scores of protesters were beaten and arrested, and in order to realise the extent to which this regime suppresses its citizens and what it is capable of, one needs only to remember the events of 1988, the situation of the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1991, the attempt on her life in 2003, and the fact that, since 1996, the regime has destroyed more than 3 000 villages and carried out the forced removal of more than one million people. Extraordinary brutality is characteristic of this regime; its catalogue of crimes includes rape, torture, forced labour and the use of child soldiers. All this is undoubtedly seen by the international community and we should not allow recent events to develop into larger scale repressions.\nThe crimes and human rights violations by the ruling regime in Burma deserve our severe condemnation. We express our solidarity with the people of Burma and demand that the arrested protesters be released immediately and that http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1991 be allowed to live a rewarding life and have freedom of action. Today a heavy responsibility also falls on certain countries in this region, such as China and India, which have the potential to exercise their", "1. Zimbabwe, in particular the case of Farai Maguwu\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on seven motions for resolutions on Zimbabwe, in particular the case of Farai Maguwu.\nAnneli J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki\nauthor. - (FI) Madam President, human rights violations in Zimbabwe have been discussed before by this Parliament. Unfortunately, once again we are forced to address them. This time it is the case of the human rights activist Farai Maguwu. He is simply a prisoner of conscience. He has been arrested and imprisoned for standing up for the human rights of others and then providing the media with information on human rights in the country.\nThe European Parliament is appealing for his release and for all human rights violations in Zimbabwe to be investigated and, obviously, ended. This case is especially blatant and, being so, particularly unpleasant, in that someone who stands up for the human rights of others himself has to suffer.\nV\u00e9ronique De Keyser\nMadam President, behind the Farai Maguwu case lies the whole issue of diamond mining.\nZimbabwe is a voluntary member of the Kimberley Process, which allows signatories to sell diamonds on the international market provided that this trade does not finance armed conflict. However, during the meeting on the Kimberley Process held on 20-21 June in Tel Aviv, the participants were unable to reach an agreement on the following question: should human rights not be integrated into the Kimberley Process too? Several international NGOs have condemned human rights violations in Zimbabwe's diamond mines, violations perpetrated by the security services. One of their informers was Farai Maguwu, the Director of the Centre for Research and Development on human rights, based in Manicaland. That is why Mr Maguwu was arrested on 3 June and why, since then, he has been detained in very difficult conditions, having allegedly breached state security provisions. This is clearly unacceptable.\nWith this resolution we are calling for the immediate release ", "Guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States - Europe 2020 - Implementation of the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States (debate) \nPresident\n\u03a4he next item is the joint debate on\nthe Council and Commission statements on Europe 2020;\nthe report by Pervenche Ber\u00e8s, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States - C7-0033/2011 -;\nthe Commission statement on the implementation of the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States.\nJ\u00e1nos Martonyi\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - Madam President, I very much welcome this opportunity to appear before you to talk about a subject which is of particular importance for the Hungarian Presidency: the Europe 2020 Strategy. Indeed, it is of particular importance for all of us.\nIt is clear that Europe has to overcome a number of serious challenges if it wishes to remain competitive with the rest of the world. Some of these challenges have been generated by the financial and economic crisis, but some of them are inherent in our limited capacities and determination to fulfil the objectives and targets of the 2010 Lisbon Strategy.\nAs is often said, crisis can be an opportunity - both in the Ancient Greek and in the Chinese interpretation. It can be an opportunity for a breakthrough, for a solution and to make progress. That is why we believe that the crisis is currently a key factor in motivating Member States to adopt quickly a new European strategy for jobs and smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. This is the Europe 2020 Strategy.\nI am convinced that this strategy will play an important role in helping Europe recover from the crisis and emerge stronger, both internally and at international level, by boosting productivity, growth potential, social cohesion and economic governance.\nThis is essential if we are going to be able to remain competitive globally, not le", "Explanations of vote\nJaroslav Zv\u011b\u0159ina\n(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I did not support the proposal to establish a European Institute of Technology. Of course I wish, like most of you, that the European Union would adapt and would produce more inventions and patents.\nHowever, having listened to the debate on this proposal I do not believe that setting up another institution is a step in the right direction. Our universities and research institutes will get no extra money; if anything, they will have another institution to compete with for research grants. Nor has the vote of our venerable institution created a new body of super-scientists. The Institute will be managed by scientists who will leave the universities where they are now. I therefore believe that it would be better if we channelled the available funds, if can find them, into the existing top scientific teams through research grants.\nMiroslav Mikol\u00e1\u0161ik\n(SK) If we actually want to overtake the US, Japan and other world leaders in science and technology and if we want Europe to set the tone, then the necessary preconditions must be created.\nCentres of excellence must have all the conditions and preconditions in place. The European Institute of Technology is a step in the right direction. It is a shame that this decision has been delayed for so long. I believe that the problems surrounding sufficient funding for the EIT will be resolved satisfactorily.\nI also support the idea of cofinancing according to the Public Private Partnership principle, as is the case, for example, at research centres in the United States. I would like scientists and researchers from the new countries also to be selected for, and involved in, the scientific teams, and the governing board to be subject to monitoring by the European Parliament. The research objectives should mirror the Seventh Framework Programme for science and research and only research on embryonic stem cells should not be funded by the taxpayers of those ", "2. Bangladesh\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution on Bangladesh.\nRobert Evans  \nauthor. - Mr President, Bangladesh is a country that I have visited many times and one of which I am very fond. Indeed, I have many friends of Bangladeshi origin in London and I follow the political situation there very closely.\nThis resolution acknowledges that the situation has deteriorated significantly in recent months, such that there are now real concerns about law and order, human rights and, indeed, the mere survival of democracy in that country, which is highlighted throughout this resolution.\nWhen the electoral process was suspended in January, I think most of us hoped it would just be a matter of weeks before elections could take place, but the weeks have become months, and months have now become years, before a new democratically-elected government can be in place.\nIn the mean time, we have the unconstitutional and unsatisfactory situation of a civilian caretaker government with the support of the military trying to keep law and order in an increasingly desperate and violent climate. Two former prime ministers are in jail. There have been riots at the university, hundreds of arrests (including of academics) and allegations of assaults and torture.\nThis cannot be the way forward and, as paragraph 11 makes clear, I am sure we in the European Parliament stand ready to help and assist to bring the return of democracy to Bangladesh as soon as possible.\nMarios Matsakis  \nauthor. - Mr President, Bangladesh is territorially about the same size as Greece but has a population almost twice that of Germany. It became a nation only in 1971 following years of civil war which involved neighbouring ex-British colonies, Pakistan and India. Bangladesh suffered 15 years of military dictatorship and, although civilian government was restored in 1990, the country is far from having a true democracy.\nToday, it is a very poor nation plagued by widespread corruption", "Formal sitting - Latvia\nPresident\nMr President of the Republic of Latvia, the right honourable Valdis Zatlers, it is a very great pleasure for us all to be able to welcome you today on your first visit to the European Parliament. I should like to start by thanking you, as the President of a country which is still a relatively new Member State of the European Union, for accepting the European Parliament's invitation to address us today, the day on which we are celebrating the 10th anniversary of our common currency, the euro. Today is a premiere in every sense of the word, as this was the first time that the European hymn has been played to welcome a guest to plenary here in the European Parliament.\n(Applause)\nMay I take this opportunity to mention once again today the historic significance of the enlargement of the European Union in 2004. It took over 60 years to bring your country back into a free and democratic Europe and unify our continent.\nWe live today in peace, freedom and democracy. Our citizens enjoy prospects that our forefathers could only have dreamed of. We must and should rejoice in that.\nIt is true that today the European Union faces new and serious challenges. Even the people of Latvia have come to feel this quite clearly, for example as a result of the financial crisis, which has also hit your country hard, Mr President. The gas crisis between Russia and Ukraine is also giving the citizens of Latvia justified cause for concern.\nIt is precisely in times of crisis that we understand the value of membership of a European Union based on the principle of solidarity between its peoples. It is precisely in this time of crisis that we all feel the need for community and cooperation between our countries and the European institutions.\nTogether we are stronger, together we can defend our interests and values better throughout the world. That is also why the European Parliament hopes the Lisbon Treaty, which gives the European Union a stronger capacity to act ", "27. Quota system in relation to the production of potato starch (vote) \n- Report: Wojciechowski, Janusz\n- Before the vote on Amendment 8:\nJanusz Wojciechowski \nrapporteur. - (PL) Mr President, We recently voted on an amendment to extend the system of starch quotas to four years. This is good news for the old Member States who have 90% of these quotas, which is enough to meet their requirements.\nLet us now do something nice for the new Member States, which are less happy with their quotas, and adopt amendment eight. This will allow quotas to be carried over from one year to the next - what the old Member States do not use in one year should be allocated in the following year to the new Member States, with the agreement of the Commission.\nI would like to point out that in the long term this amendment would not lead to an increase in quotas, and I ask that it be approved for the sake of European solidarity. If this amendment is adopted, I have been authorised by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group to withdraw amendments five, six and seven, which will result in an increase in quotas.\nPresident\nWe have received some information that would have been more appropriate during the course of the debate which has already taken place on the report.\n", "1. Combating cancer in the enlarged European Union (vote) \n- Before the vote on Amendment 2\nMarios Matsakis\nMr President, cancer may cause chronic illness and can possibly lead to disability, therefore in order to make new paragraph 34a more accurate and more credible I propose an oral amendment to include the words 'may include' and 'possibly' in the appropriate areas in that subparagraph.\n(The oral amendment was accepted)\n", "6. Placing on the market and use of biocidal products (\nCorinne Lepage\n(FR) Mr President, regarding the vote on the report by Mrs Kla\u00df, I wanted to say that there is an error on page 10 of the ALDE Group's voting list - which corresponds to page 5 of the Kla\u00df report, but page 10 of the voting paper. As regards 342d, we must vote for and not against, as that is part of the overall compromise agreement. Regarding 342d, the vote must be for and not against.\nPresident\nWe may start the vote.\nI would like to point out that Amendment 338 has been withdrawn. Also, Amendments 8 and 317 do not relate to all language versions, and will therefore not be put to the vote.\n", "Protection of the Communities' financial interests - Fight against fraud - Annual reports 2005 and 2006 (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Musotto, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on protection of the Communities' financial interests - Fight against fraud - Annual reports 2005 and 2006.\nFrancesco Musotto\nrapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Kallas for his valuable cooperation with Parliament during its work. I am likewise grateful to OLAF, in the person of the Director, Franz-Hermann Br\u00fcner, for its unstinting support and for the vital work it does, which is far from easy. Finally, I would thank all my colleagues for their helpful contributions, as well as all the national bodies and institutions that have cooperated with us in this arduous task, especially - if I may - the Italian Guardia di finanza, whose approach in this field has been highly professional.\nProtection of the Communities' financial interests is a subject of capital importance which affects us directly as States and as citizens; it must therefore be tackled with all due rigour and determination.\nToday's resolution is intended as a practical response to the alarming phenomenon of Community fraud. The data gathered...\n(The President interrupted the speaker to reprimand some Members who were causing a disturbance)\nThank you, Mr President. We are talking about transparency and there is also a need for common courtesy.\nToday's resolution is intended as a practical response to the alarming phenomenon of Community fraud. The data gathered are worrying: in the areas of own resources, agricultural expenditure and structural actions, irregularities notified in 2006 totalled EUR 1 143 million, compared to EUR 1 024 million in the previous year. The statistics reveal an ever-increasing number of irregularities.\nI would however point out that a large number of irregularities does not necessarily imply a high", "Statement by the President\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, I am saddened and dismayed to have to inform you today that, last weekend, more than 300 people were drowned when a number of refugee boats went down in the Mediterranean off the coast of Libya. These boats were carrying people from North and sub-Saharan Africa. Some of the refugees were rescued by the Egyptian and Libyan authorities, and some bodies have been recovered, but hundreds of people are still missing. I would like, on behalf of the European Parliament, to say how deeply shocked and saddened we are by this event.\nOver the last two years, the European Union has been experiencing an increase in immigration via the Mediterranean, and the economic crisis means that we can expect to see significantly more people fleeing poverty in Africa.\nThe large numbers of refugees that tragically lose their lives when attempting to reach the European Union threaten to turn the Mediterranean into a huge open-air graveyard; it is up to us to find solutions to put an end to these tragedies.\nI would ask you now to observe a minute's silence in memory of the dead.\n(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)\nThank you.\n", "One-minute speeches (Rule 150) \nPresident\nThe next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance in accordance with Rule 150 of the Rules of Procedure.\nTheodoros Skylakakis\n(EL) Madam President, first of all a few words on Egypt. The External Action Service will need to be activated to the maximum in the difficult times ahead, in order to protect European citizens in Egypt, the rights of minorities in Egypt and the historic institutions that represent them, such as the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate in Alexandria.\nNow to come back to my basic subject of waste. Although we have a high-level legislative framework, almost every Member State faces infringement difficulties. Many are reporting rubbish crises and some sectors, such as cross-border transportation of waste, are in mass breach of Community law. At the same time, for political reasons, the famous 'not in my back yard' policy, the Member States are not participating as effectively as they should in the efforts being made.\nThe Commission therefore needs to propose new additional instruments, such as extending the responsibilities of the European Environmental Agency and the facility for the Union to send missions to verify information in the Member States. The Commission needs to think about this in light of the proposals for 2012.\nVasilica Viorica D\u0103ncil\u0103\n(RO) Madam President, I would like to highlight the situation in Romania regarding the blatant violation of the principles of the rule of law by the current government. The arrest of a prominent member of the opposition, Constantin Nicolescu, an arrest announced prior to the start of the judicial hearing and without any hard evidence, demonstrates the undemocratic way in which the current government is acting. The arrest carried out by political order, along with the contempt shown to ordinary citizens through the antisocial measures adopted by the government, is bringing out onto the streets the people who have been demeaned and condemned t", "Voting time (continuation) \nNicole Sinclaire\nMr President, while I send my best wishes to Mr Fari\u00f1as and congratulate him on his prize, I would remind Parliament that one year ago we had representatives from Memorial here, who richly deserved the prize also. Since then, two of them have been arrested and yet Russia has been awarded a prestigious football tournament - the World Cup - in 2018, over and above five EU countries.\nWhy did the European Parliament not voice its concern? If this prize is to mean anything, you need to stand up against these human rights abuses.\n", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 16 June 2000.\n\nTribute\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, it is with great sadness that we learnt, last Tuesday, of the death of President Pierre Pflimlin, the former President of the European Parliament.\nPierre Pflimlin was a true statesman. His career in public office began immediately following the war and took him to the offices of Council President and Head of Government in 1958 at a time when France was experiencing one of the most unsettled periods of its history, when he eased the transition period with General de Gaulle. He played an active part in framing the constitution of the Fifth Republic and became a government minister, holding this position until 1962.\nPierre Pflimlin belonged to that historic generation of Europeans who, since the end of the war, as a member of parliament, a minister and a political activist, was at the forefront of all the efforts to build a strong and reunited Europe. As an native of Alsace and of Strasbourg and a friend and comrade of Robert Schuman, he was one of the most ardent proponents of reconciliation between France and Germany, and a powerful symbol of French-German friendship. He saw this reconciliation that he had worked so hard to achieve, as he confided to the Bishop of Strasbourg, as an absolute miracle. He knew, nonetheless, that this miracle was not a random event, but rather the outcome of proactive and constructive commitment, based on common objectives and efficient institutions.\nIn 1959, Pierre Pflimlin joined the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and in 1963 began a three-year term as President. Around the same time he became a Member of the European Parliament (1962-1967) before returning in 1979 at the first elections by universal suffrage. He was elected First Vice-President in 1982 and was President from 1984 to 1987.\nDuring his presidency, the European Parliament established a key", "\nOrtuondo Larrea\nMr President, I should publicly like to reject and condemn the botched procedure, although I do not know if it has been adopted by the Conference of Presidents, the Presidencies of the Council and the Commission or the Presidency of Parliament, for dealing with an issue as important and far-reaching as terrorism in Spain. This may be in line with the Rules of Procedure, but it is neither ethically nor democratically acceptable for such a crucial issue to be dealt with using a procedure that does not provide for a political debate on a specific proposal for a resolution to which all of the interested parliamentary groups can present amendments. As I see it, the procedure adopted asserts that a written declaration presented by five Spanish Members of the European Parliament - who are fully within their rights to do so - can become the official position of Parliament. If this were the case, however, it would amount to a position adopted selfishly, by the back door and almost by stealth, so as to prevent other groups and Members from having the chance to present amendments or changes with the aim of achieving a broad consensus on the text.\nMr President, representatives of the Council and the Commission, might I be so bold as to say that what has happened today is a huge political mistake, and that something as important as Parliament' s position on terrorism will not have the broad support of everyone, since there will be some who, whilst unequivocally rejecting and condemning terrorism...\n(The President cut the speaker off)\n\nPresident\n I am very sorry Mr Ortuondo, we are now taking note of the fact that you do not approve of what has been decided. However, this is a decision taken by the competent bodies of this Parliament. We have taken note of your opinion.\nLet us turn to what we should be talking about, namely the Minutes, as Mr Ortuondo did not comment on the Minutes. Who wants to comment on yesterday' s Minutes?\n\nSchleicher\nMr President, I would l", "Voting time\nReinhard B\u00fctikofer\n(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the parliamentary sitting on 9 June, I made a mistake during the vote. I was not aware of it, but nevertheless it was a mistake which was not in accordance with the rules. During the vote I pressed my button and that of Mr Turmes at the same time. This is sometimes referred to ironically as a 'slip-up'. I did not intend to do this and I will not do it again. I am sorry. Mr Langen raised the matter and the President issued a reprimand. I simply wanted to apologise.\nPresident\nThank you for your statement, Mr B\u00fctikofer, and I understand that this is a serious breach of discipline during voting time. I would also like to thank you for your promise that such a thing will never happen again. This should also act as a warning to all of us, and we will remember it. Mr Atkins would now like to take the floor.\nRobert Atkins\nMr President, I understood that it was a decision of the Conference of Presidents that any report that had more than 50 amendments had to be referred back to the committee to be resolved. We have four reports in front of us today - the Langen, Lepage, Eickhout and Pieper reports - all of which have more than 50 amendments. I ask you, therefore, to enforce the standing order and refer these reports back to committee, so that they do not take up our time when they should be sorted out in committee.\n(Applause)\nPresident\n- Thank you for your comment, Mr Atkins, but these decisions are not automatic. There is no automatic referral of reports with over 50 amendments back to committee, since further decisions are required for this to happen. In future we will always observe the rules which we ourselves have put in place.\nDimitar Stoyanov\n- (BG) Mr President, today during the debate on the Hungarian Presidency, Mr Cohn-Bendit made some fairly offensive remarks to the Hungarian prime minister, calling him a schizophrenic. I want to ask you whether there will be any punitive measures taken so", "Term of protection of copyright and related rights (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Crowley, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2006/116/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the term of protection of copyright and related rights - C6-0281/2008 -.\nBrian Crowley\nrapporteur. - Mr President, I should like to welcome Commissioner McCreevy into the Chamber and to thank all colleagues who are here this evening.\nThe extension of copyright and the term of protection has been a long and arduous journey for all of us, in particular because a huge amount of people are not fully aware of all the facts associated with copyright.\nAt the outset, let me put on the official record of the House my thanks to all of my colleagues, both those who support and those who oppose the proposal I am putting forward, for their contributions, their input and in particular for their helpful advice and guidance along the road. I should also like to thank the secretariat of the Committee on Legal Affairs and in particular Giorgio, who has been a very strong advocate and adviser with regard to all these areas, and, finally, Commissioner McCreevy and all his staff. I would hate to name them individually, but the man sitting next to you has done Trojan work with regard to this report and this directive.\nMany lies have been told - and I use the word 'lies' guardedly with regard to what we are trying to do here. This can be condensed down very simply into four very clear areas. Firstly, the extension of the term of protection from the present 50 years to a further extension of term. We are now proposing, as part of a compromise, 70 years. That proposal for compromise is founded on some of the resistance from the Council of Ministers, and it disappoints me that the Council Presidency is not represented here tonight. In fact, all during this process I feel the Counc", "Explanations of vote\nPedro Guerreiro \nin writing. - (PT) As our group says, this proposal, which introduces biometric data information into the uniform format for residence permits for third-country nationals, 'raises several concerns as regards its technical feasibility, financial costs and risk of its abuse'.\nAs we have highlighted, it is highly debatable whether the introduction of biometric identifiers really does increase security, or whether it is rather a threat to security through the risks of abuse, technological flaws and lack of transparency and sound data protection\nThis is a disproportionate measure that forms part of a supranational dynamic, a measure that is aimed at setting up EU-level monitoring and control instruments. It is not in any way accompanied by 'particularly consistent and serious safeguards, especially regarding the way they are collected and used' and it is completely impossible to guarantee its use in a 'relatively safe environment'.\nThis proposal is both a consequence and an integral part of the trend towards excessive preoccupation with security pursued by the EU institutions, and as such we reject it.\nMary Lou McDonald \nin writing. The second modified proposal introducing biometric data information into Regulation 1030/2002 laying down a uniform format for residence permits for third country nationals raises several concerns as regards its technical feasibility, financial costs and the risk of its abuse. It is still not clear whether the introduction of biometric identifiers really does increase security or whether it is rather a threat to security through the risks of abuse, technological flaws and lack of transparency and sound data protection. The original Commission proposal has also turned out to be technically impossible and the financial resources destined for its development have been partly wasted. Due to these reasons, we cannot support the Commission's modified proposal, which would again only raise the financial costs an", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nSouchet\nMadam President, I would simply like to point out that on Wednesday, on the initiative of the President, we voted for an adjournment of the urgent debate on Zaire, but not for the debate to be closed.\nNow this item was not reinstated yesterday on the agenda of urgent debates, whereas quite a large number of Members had asked to be called to speak individually on this item. They were unable to do this, and I would like, Madam President, to express my amazement and surprise at this omission.\n\nPresident\nMr Souchet, I do understand, but it seems to me that the article cited when closure of the debate was announced was in fact Article 130, which provides for closures and not adjournment.\n(Parliament approved the Minutes)\n\nVotes\nKinnock, Neil\nMadam President, as my colleague, Mrs Bonino, made clear yesterday, the Commission intends to reserve its position on Parliament's request to withdraw the proposal until the Council has made its opinion available. The Commission naturally will keep the House fully informed of any decisions on the follow-up to the proposal.\n\nFraga Estevez\nMadam President, since the Commission has refused to withdraw its proposal, I think that the House should apply Rule 59(3) of the Rules of Procedure, in other words refer the proposal back to the committee without voting on the draft legislative resolution.\n(Parliament decided to refer the matter back to the committee responsible)\n\nColom i Naval\nMadam President, with regard to the amendments: I have nothing to say about the first one. I will leave this to the discretion of the House since it was not debated, although it can be seen that the said amendment emerged from the debate we held on the ECSC budget for 97, on the Giansily report. On the second amendment by the Socialist Group, I would like to explain, Madam President, that this paragraph 32 was modified by the Committee ", "3. Exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (\nBefore the vote:\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs\nMember of the Commission. - Madam President, the Commission welcomes the report by Ms Frassoni, which approves the conclusion of the bilateral agreement between Parliament and the Commission on procedures for implementing Council Decision 1999/468/EC, as amended by Decision 2006/512/EC. In this context, the Commission underlines that paragraph 11 of the agreement covers extremely urgent cases in general.\nThe Commission would like to thank Parliament and in particular Mr Galeote and Mr Corbett for the excellent spirit of cooperation which prevailed during the negotiation of this agreement. Yesterday the Commission approved the agreement and President Barroso will sign it in the coming days.\n", "Ovine and caprine animals: electronic identification (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 as regards the date of introduction of electronic identification for ovine and caprine animals - C6-0448/2007 -.\nMarkos Kyprianou\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, as we all know, traceability is a key element of ensuring high standards in animal health and food safety.\nWe have had recent experience with certain diseases in the European Union, such as foot-and-mouth disease and bluetongue, which has once again shown the importance of efficient identification systems. Individual identification cannot function properly without electronic identification.\nThe Commission was requested to confirm or amend, in its report, the date of implementation of electronic identification, not to question the principles of the regulation. That is why it is a technical report on the various methods and technology involved.\nThe Commission report only focuses on the best way to implement electronic identification. However, in order to produce a report, we needed data and input from the Member States, and in particular those Member States already working on the system. The studies and trials necessary for the preparation of the report lasted much longer than was originally foreseen, which explains the delay in the report.\nWe strongly appreciate and thank Parliament for agreeing to handle this matter as urgent. That will prevent a situation of legal uncertainty in January 2008.\nThe report concludes that technical conditions for electronic identification of sheep and goats have been fulfilled, but that Member States need a reasonable time frame to prepare the implementation of electronic identification.\nWe agree with, and accept, Parliament's position to have a fixed date for introduction of the system. On the other ", "Approval of the minutes\nPresident\nThe minutes of yesterday's session have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nSchierhuber\nMr President, I should just like to point out that yesterday, regarding the Rothley report, I gave two written explanations of vote on Amendment No 74, which unfortunately I am unable to find in the minutes, and also an oral explanation of vote on the amended Commission proposal. I should like to ask you to ensure that this is noted in the minutes.\n\nFord\nMr President, this is a personal statement. Members may recall that on the Monday of the last partsession I made allegations about Mrs Angelilli, which on the Wednesday she denied. I provided her with a copy of the document on which I had based my allegations. I have received a letter from her this morning indicating, amongst the usual torrent of abuse, that she does not intend to sue the magazine, as I suggested. I hope Members will draw the appropriate conclusions. I will make a copy of her letter available to you, Mr President.\n\nProvan\nMr President, it is not often that we pay Parliament's services compliments but we always find the daily news briefing extremely helpful. The summary of yesterday's great statement by the Commission has been avidly sought by everybody who takes the English version, so much so that there are none available, and there are a number of Members who, I know, would like the succinct encapsulation of the Commission's proposals that Parliament normally provides. I wonder whether you could ensure that the services, on such great occasions as yesterday, make sure that there are ample copies available in English?\n\nSantini\nMr President, as it is my profession to act as counsel ex officio , I wish, in order to respect the ethical principles which we have always adhered to in this Parliament, to condemn Mr Ford's attack, for the simple reason that Mrs Angelilli is not present, so she cannot explain her own position. I would have said this irrespective of which Member or", "European Authentic Act - E-Justice - Cross-border implications of the legal protection of adults (debate) \nPresident. -The next item on the agenda is the joint debate on\nManuel Medina Ortega's report, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, with recommendations to the Commission on the European Authentic Act,\nDiana Wallis' report, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, concerning recommendations to the Commission on e-justice, and\nAntonio L\u00f3pez-Ist\u00fariz White's report, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, with recommendations to the Commission on cross-border implications of the legal protection of adults.\nManuel Medina Ortega\nMr President, this is an initiative by Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs that aims to achieve recognition of European authentic acts.\nThis initiative of Parliament calls on the Commission to adopt the measures that it considers appropriate. It is based on the Hague Programme, namely the recognition not only of judicial decisions but also of authentic acts.\nThe purpose of this initiative is to facilitate the position of consumers within the European Union.\nThe formalities required for recognising such acts are both expensive and time-consuming.\nIt seems we should therefore facilitate the movement or recognition of such authentic acts so that whenever there is a cross-border formality, such as a marriage, a contract or something similar, it is not necessary to have to go through cumbersome procedures.\nThe difficulty that this report may present is the nature of the European authentic act or public document itself, which is recognised in most of the countries in the European Union but not in others.\nThere are countries where the system of the European authentic act issued by a public official does not exist. Instead there are simple private documents legalised by a notary public, although the nature of the document does not vary.\nThe precedent for this proposal is the Unibank judgment by the European Court of Justice, whic", "22. European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (vote) \n- Before the final vote:\nKinga G\u00e1l \nrapporteur. - Mr President, given the fact that we have adopted the amended proposal, I should like to ask Mr Frattini if he will accept the amendments just adopted by this House, or does he need more time for some final compromises in the Council?\nFranco Frattini\nMr President, I believe that a further period of reflection would be appropriate. You all know my opinion on the amendments that you have just approved. The Council still has some difficulty in accepting them. I believe that the best solution would be to take some time and for us to attempt to convince the Council to accommodate the opinion expressed today by Parliament.\nKinga G\u00e1l \nrapporteur. - Mr President, I therefore request that the vote be postponed and the matter be referred back to the committee responsible, pursuant to Rule 53 of the Rules of Procedure, in order to await the Council's position on the amendments.\n(Parliament decided to postpone the vote and the matter is therefore considered referred back to the competent committee for further examination)\n", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nZuzana Roithov\u00e1\n(CS) Wilderness and its diversity represent a gift and treasure that humanity should look after not just in the European Union. The European Union's efforts will remain ineffective as long as we do not stop the destruction of tropical rainforests, plundering Asian, African and American waters, as long as we do not spread more effective education about our joint responsibility for protecting nature against humanity all over the planet, and it will make this report, which I also supported today, just another scrap of paper.\nCzes\u0142aw Adam Siekierski\n(PL) Mr President, if we wish to halt the accelerating process of loss of biodiversity, it is essential to protect Europe's wildernesses forests and water bodies. For our common actions to be effective, it is vital, firstly, to draw up unequivocal definitions of wildernesses and to establish the precise location of the latter on the map of the Community.\nIt is also vital to develop a strategy based on expert analyses of risks and of the processes involved in the degradation of wilderness areas. This relates, in particular, to the invasion of foreign species that compete with the indigenous ones, and also to the impact of ongoing climate change.\nAnother key issue is tourism in its broadest sense. I refer, in particular, to the implications of unsustainable or indeed aggressive tourism. If we are to raise awareness of these issues amongst the Community's citizens, it is important to conduct information campaigns, to provide special funds in the framework of local authority institutions and to support grass roots initiatives.\nMiroslav Mikol\u00e1\u0161ik\nMr President, I would like to congratulate Gyula Hegyi on his dossier and thorough research.\nAt this time of global climate change and environmental troubles, it is clear that we need to address the issue of the European wilderness. I believe that it is important that we coordinate a strategy for the protection and restoratio", "1. Cuba\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on four motions for resolutions on Cuba.\nLaima Liucija Andrikien\nauthor. - Madam President, the Council has recently recognised that no tangible results have been achieved on human rights in Cuba, despite the goodwill shown by the Council in 2005.\nThe majority of us, if not all of us, are in agreement that it is necessary for Cuba to launch a process of political transition to multi-party democracy. This is not the Eurocentric position our opponents like to use against us but is about the universality and indivisibility of human rights, including civil, political and economic rights, in which we believe. Today we again urge the Council and Commission to continue to take whatever action is necessary to demand the release of political prisoners and prisoners of conscience.\nIt is important to give our unconditional support and full encouragement to the launching of a peaceful process of transition to a multi-party democracy in Cuba. We have examples to follow. Twenty years ago the present EU Member States from Eastern and Central Europe were in many ways - including as regards their human rights situation - in a similar situation to that which Cuba is in now. I hope that we will soon witness major changes in Cuba and I look forward to that very special day.\nMarcin Libicki \nauthor. - (PL) Madam President, Cuba has been ruled by a dictator for almost half a century and human rights are constantly being violated there. It is practically the last remaining bastion of Communism in the world. North Korea is another such bastion, whilst the Chinese regime is somewhat different but often equally cruel.\nAfter the collapse of Communism in 1989 we expected those Communist countries to review their situation and that Communism would collapse there too. Unfortunately, that did not happen, notably in Cuba. It is true that the intensity of persecution in Cuba varied. There were times when it was particularly cruel and other periods when a", "8. Regulation applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences (vote) \nYannick Jadot\nMr President, I should like to table an oral amendment to this amendment, deleting two parts of the amendment, namely the words 'by the Colombian army' and 'on Colombia'.\nTherefore, the amendment reads as follows: 'considers that the alarming news concerning the killings of trade unionists in Colombia, as well as the news recently received and now confirmed by Colombia's public prosecutor that mass graves containing the bodies of hundreds of people killed in recent years have been discovered in the region of La Macarena, are sufficient evidence to enable the Commission to open an investigation in accordance with the regulation.'\n", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 15 November 2001.\n\nAnnouncement by the President\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, Spain has once again been cruelly struck by terrorism.\nOn 23 November, Ana Isabel Arostegui and Javier Mijangos, both officers of the Ertzaintza, the Basque regional police, were killed in a cowardly attack whilst carrying out their duties in Beasa\u00edn, in the Basque region of Spain.\nTwo days prior to that incident, terrorists set off a bomb in Bilbao, injuring two other officers of the same police force.\nOn my own behalf and on behalf of the European Parliament as a whole, I immediately sent a message expressing my most sincere condolences to the families of the victims of these despicable attacks, as well as our wishes for a speedy recovery to those injured.\nOnce again, terrorist groups in Spain have acted with fatal disregard, showing that they deny the right to life and totally reject the concept of democracy. Having made an assault on justice, by killing Judge Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Lidon Corbi, they have, this time, attacked the Basque regional police force. In doing so, they are showing their determination to attack the main pillars of democracy.\nWith our heartfelt thoughts for the victims, their families and all those who fight for democracy, I would like to ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to observe a minute' s silence.\n(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)\n\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, since our last session, five journalists have unfortunately been killed in Afghanistan.\nMaria Grazia Cutulli, Julio Fuentes, Harry Burton and Azizullah Haidari were killed in an ambush between Jalalabad and Kabul. Ulf Stroemberg was found dead following a burglary in Taloqan. As you know, we are also extremely concerned about Ken Hechtman, who is missing.\nThe eight journalists who have died in Afghanistan since the beginning of the conflict were carrying out their duties in a courag", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nJanssen van Raay\nOn Rules 2, 5 and 119 of the Rules of Procedure. I am here, but I refuse to take part in the roll-call votes in protest at the fact that the Quaestors have failed to take a decision for the appeal proceedings before the Court in Luxembourg, which I requested in writing last August, on Mr Chamier's decision unlawfully to reduce my general parliamentary allowances.\n\nPresident\nYour comments will be included in the Minutes of the sitting.\n\nAlavanos\nMr President, yesterday the war in Yugoslavia claimed its greatest number of victims. Seventy innocent Albanian-speaking citizens of Yugoslavia, among them women and children, were killed by NATO bombs. I do not know if we should pay our respects to them. You can decide.\n\nPresident\nIt seems to me that the House has extended and is daily extending its sympathy to the victims - to all the victims - of the conflict.\n\nBalfe\nMr President, on a point of order. I have a rather mundane and minor point. Could my name be added to those who were present? You will see that I was present because I voted in all of the roll-call votes, but I am not on the list.\n\nPresident\nIt will be done, Mr Balfe.\n\nMcMahon\nMr President, I have a rather mundane point as well. Yesterday, during the vote on my report and Mr Chanterie's report, Mr Collins reported to the House that there was a photographer in the balcony photographing individual Members' papers and voting lists. I would like to know what the outcome of these investigations were, particularly given the amount of lobbying which I received concerning my report. I wonder whether representatives of the oil companies or the bus companies are trying to get a squint at what the Socialist voting lists were. Could the Bureau let us know the outcome of their investigations into this please?\n\nPresident\nAs you know, Mr McMahon, after Mr Collins pointed out what was happening", "Agenda\nPresident\nWith regard to the agenda for today and tomorrow, the corresponding corrigendum has been distributed, drawn up with the agreement of the political groups and including the following changes, as well as those that were announced on 28 September:\n- Wednesday:\nFrom 3 p.m. to 4 p.m., we are adding the statements by the European Union's High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Commission on the nuclear test by North Korea. We welcome Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner who are here for that purpose.\nWith regard to the oral questions on footwear from China and Vietnam, I must point out that the Council will not take part in that debate.\nHannes Swoboda\n(DE) Mr President, we are, in principle, happy with these alterations, and particularly happy that Mr Solana has found ways and means of getting here.\nWe are, however, very far from happy with the fact that the Council's willingness to agree to be present only to a very limited extent means that a great deal of today's agenda has had to be put off to another day. Although this also happened under the Austrian Presidency, we did manage to come to an arrangement. I ask that the Presidencies of the Council be reminded that a provisional agenda is not final, and that it can of course happen - as it has on this occasion - that we have to respond to events as they happen. I would also ask the governments of which the Council is composed to ensure that they are able to be present for the sittings in Brussels at least until the evening. That is absolutely vital, for if they cannot, we cannot get through all the things that are - and indeed have to be - on the agenda. I would ask that this be communicated to the Council and that it be urged to be more visibly and more frequently present in this House.\n(Applause)\nPresident\nThere is a change of title concerning the Council and Commission statement on the Informal Meeting in Lahti.\nThe Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance asks that the ", "8.

Amendment of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union with regard to a stability mechanism for Member States whose currency is the euro (\nElmar Brok\nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this European stability mechanism is necessary in order to provide enduring legal assurance and in order to guarantee solidarity with countries that are having problems, but also in order to secure the euro, guarantee the necessary budgetary discipline and enable a joint response to growth challenges.\nIn view of the time that an ordinary procedure would have taken, and also in order to avoid a referendum in some Member States, this can only be regulated by a simplified Treaty revision procedure. However, Parliament is saying that this should not become the usual procedure and that we should actually proceed here in accordance with the ordinary Treaty revision procedure.\nThe original proposals stated that this should be a purely intergovernmental method in which the Commission had hardly any role and the European Parliament no role whatsoever. Today we are able to report that, further to the negotiations that we have held with the Commission, the European Central Bank, the President of the European Council and the President of the Euro Group, in almost all matters concerning models, tests and decision bases, all aspects concerned with defining a framework and proposing a regulation for this in a Community procedure, it has so far been accepted by the European Council, by the Council of Finance Ministers, that the European Parliament can also play a part in this process and will play a role in such matters.\nWe were thus not too pleased initially, but I believe that if Community institutions are used and we can start using intergovernmental procedures as in the past, then when the time is right it will be easy to arrive at a clear Community policy. Since the institutional conditions are now in place, we can propose to you that we approve this Treaty revis", "External dimension of the fight against terrorism (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Ya\u00f1ez-Barnuevo Garc\u00eda on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the external dimension of the fight against terrorism\n.\nLuis Ya\u00f1ez-Barnuevo Garc\u00eda \nrapporteur. - (ES) Madam President, international terrorism is the most dangerous threat to peace, security, human dignity and integrity.\nBeing an invisible enemy, which is geographically diffuse, and which can be found inside and outside of our borders, it needs to be fought in a way that is different to the way the European Union has had to fight its enemies in the past.\nThe European Union's anti-terrorist strategy must be global, multilateral and based on the United Nations system. Any unilateral and exclusively military response is doomed to failure. The fight against terrorism will be won in the field of values. It is therefore crucial, in order to defeat terrorism morally, to increase the awareness of it and mobilise our public opinion. We must at no point lower our guard. We must not just react following a massive attack, but rather we should act in a permanent and proactive manner.\nA strengthened CFSP is vital to our success. This means making improvements, providing better resources and better coordination amongst European intelligence and information services and more work on uncovering terrorism's funding channels.\nIn its external actions, the Union must focus on stopping certain States providing support for terrorist groups, through coercive measures and sanctions, and it must help weak States to strengthen their institutions and their democracy in order to prevent them from harbouring terrorists.\nMadam President, preserving the rule of law and human rights in the fight against terrorism is not just absolutely crucial for moral reasons. It is the raison d'etre of our strategy, because that is precisely what the terrorists want to destroy: the values on which our co-existence is based. If we give grou", "Atypical contracts, secured professional paths and new forms of social dialogue (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Pascale Gruny, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on atypical contracts, secured professional paths, flexicurity and new forms of social dialogue.\nPascale Gruny\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is only one lesson to be learned here, namely, that full-time contracts of an indefinite duration must remain the norm.\nFirst of all, I would like to thank all the colleagues who contributed to the drawing up of this report.\nToday, I am disappointed that a debate has not been held on a matter which lies at the heart of the 2020 strategy. A number of my colleagues wished to speak on the subject, but were not given the opportunity to do so. Nevertheless, I would strongly encourage them to submit their contributions, in written form, to Parliament's services.\nI am also disappointed that, having worked closely with all the political groups to achieve an agreement after numerous consultations, an alternative resolution, which is almost identical to my report, has been tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.\nMy group cannot support the two elements which Mrs Schroedter has added to the alternative resolution, and which the Committee had rejected in a vote.\nFirst of all, with regard to the basis of these proposals, which concern, above all, 'false' self-employed persons: it is true that these are a real, widespread problem. As the report mentions, we would like a better definition of self-employed persons, but we must also ensure that the criterion pertaining to non self-employed persons is clearly defined, rather than relying on the presumption of employee status. The definition proposed by the Greens is much more vague and does not provide any added value to the text adopted by the Committee.\nSecondly, with regard to the call for a directive to guarantee the same rights to a", "5.

It was possible to conclude this dossier primarily thanks to the creative cooperation of all three institutions, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank especially the rapporteur, J\u00f3zsef Sz\u00e1jer, for his cooperation and the work done.\nNow that this part of the adjustment has been concluded, both legislative branches, and especially the European Parliament, will be able to exercise control over the executive powers of the Commission in connection with numerous legislative acts in important fields. In conclusion I would also like to see this kind of creative cooperation continue during the coming French Presidency.\nJ\u00f3zsef Sz\u00e1jer\nrapporteur. - Mr President, as a result of the vote just cast, for the first time Parliament acquires the real right of control and veto over the normative executive acts of the European Commission on an equal footing with the Council.\nBy adopting the two omnibus packages we take a very big step in eliminating the democratic deficit of the Union. I also want to remind colleagues that our new power of control over the EU executive requires from us more work than before. Parliament has to prepare itself for the new task of the comitology procedure.\nI thank the Council, and especially the Slovenian presidency, and the Commission, particularly because they both are giving up important and so far exclusive rights and conceding them to Parliament, and they are both losing exclusive powers. I would also like to thank our colleagues in the respective committees who understand the importance of the new empowerment of the European Parliament. They acted very quickly and flexibly on this dossier.", "6. Emission performance standards for new passenger cars (\n- After the vote:\nAvril Doyle\nrapporteur. - Mr President, as rapporteur, I had wanted to speak before my report, but I thank you for the opportunity to speak now, because it is important for all our sakes that a couple of things are put on the record.\nThere is probably one issue that would unite all of us in this Chamber here this morning, and that is that first-reading agreements do justice neither to respecting parliamentary procedure nor to the substance of the legislation, especially when the issue is very complex and technical.\n(Applause)\nFirst-reading agreements must, therefore, be rare and the exception, and only exceptional circumstances deserve such an exceptional response.\nMy second procedural point is that there is no legal provision for the involvement of Heads of State in the codecision process.\n(Applause)\nWhile aspects of the climate package were on the agenda at last week's summit meeting, and a requirement from that summit that any future revisions on amendments to aspects of EU ETS be available to be considered by future summits, at the subsequent trialogue on Saturday morning in Brussels, I added, with the full support of all the shadow rapporteurs, a new recital to my report - subsequent to the summit - which was then accepted by COREPER on Saturday afternoon. That recital emphasised the unique and transformative nature of EU ETS legislation, but stated that this consultation with Heads of State and Government must in no way be taken as a precedent for any other legislation.\nIt has been an epic legislative journey. I should like to thank Commissioner Dimas and his team, Minister Borloo and his team, with particular thanks to Ambassador L\u00e9glise-Costa for his enormous body of work. I should like to thank the staff of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety - and allow me to single out Virpi K\u00f6ykk\u00e4 for her Trojan work - all our group staff, my personal assistant, Kavi,", "Second revision of the ACP-EU Partnership agreement (Cotonou agreement) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Eva Joly, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the second revision of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement (Cotonou Agreement).\nEva Joly\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the revision of the Cotonou Agreement gives us an opportunity to learn lessons from the crises that we face: the economic and financial crisis, the social or food crisis, climate change, energy challenges and the persistence of extreme poverty.\nThe dominant economic model that is the unbridled free market, and our lifestyles, have not just shown their limitations, but have actually caused these unprecedented multidimensional crises. We must therefore carry out a radical overhaul of all our policies.\nThe report submitted to you today and adopted unanimously by the members of the Committee on Development seems to me to represent a first step towards this necessary revision.\nThe main imperative to respect is consistency. European Union trade policy, fisheries and agriculture must be designed consistently and in such a way as to ensure sustainable development, to fight poverty and guarantee a decent standard of living and income for everyone.\nI am sorry to tell you that this is not the case today. By making trade an end in itself, and not a means to serve its development policy, the European Union is sacrificing the populations of developing countries for the benefit of its multinationals. Therefore, negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreements are quite rightly causing controversy amongst the governments of the ACP, unions and civil society, which see them as a threat to their economies.\nAgriculture is one of the most problematic issues and remains tragically neglected in cooperation between the European Union and the ACP countries. Although rural areas and this sector represent more than 60% of the population and their jobs, their share of the European", "3. Guinea (vote) \n- Before the vote on section D of the Preamble:\nHarlem D\u00e9sir\n(FR) Mr President, we have indeed agreed to withdraw our Amendment 1 in order to maintain a consensus and a unanimity among the groups that, I am delighted to say, will, I believe, strengthen the resolution. With the agreement of the various groups, we have instead submitted an oral amendment to be added at the end of recital D and which I will read to you in English, since that is the language to be used as reference and in which the oral amendment was negotiated. It will specify that intervention is taking place by mercenaries from Liberia and Sierra Leone, currently used by the authorities, but that officially there is not yet absolute proof of such intervention, even if all observers on the ground have begun to note it. In order to refer to the situation while remaining rigorous, we will state the following:\n'whereas there are allegations of the presence of mercenaries and former guerrilla fighters'.\n(FR) However, I believe that our fellow Member, Mr Matsakis, wished to make an oral amendment to the oral amendment in order to make it still more precise, and I should like to say straight away that I support the wording that he will now propose to us, so that we may all vote unanimously in favour of the same text.\nMarios Matsakis\nMr President, in order to clarify it even further and make it more factually correct and comprehensive, I wish to make an oral amendment to the oral amendment by Mr D\u00e9sir.\nAfter the words 'whereas there are allegations of the presence of mercenaries and former guerrilla fighters', I wish to add 'working as paramilitary government forces'.\n(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)\nPresident\nThat concludes the vote.\n", "Order of business\nPresident\nThe final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 9 November 2006 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed. The following amendments have been proposed.\nMonday:\nI have received a request from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to postpone the debate on the report by Mrs Bachelot-Narquin on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.\nWho would like to move this request on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament?\nJean Louis Cottigny\n(FR) Mr President, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament requests that the debate and the vote on Mrs Bachelot's report on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund be postponed.\nIn fact, because COREPER and the Finnish Presidency only finalised their version of the regulation on Friday 10 November, the document did not reach us until the end of the afternoon. As a result, although we worked with the rapporteur all last week in informal meetings with the Council and the Commission, we were not able to have an initial discussion amongst ourselves between Friday evening and today. We therefore ask that both the debate and the votes be postponed to the second November session in order to enable us to carry out our examination of the proposals made to us by the Council.\nRoselyne Bachelot-Narquin \nMr President, I also take the floor with the agreement of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to support the position of my fellow Member, Mr Cottigny, and to request that the vote and the debate be postponed.\nIn fact, as my fellow Member has just said, the latest information concerning the Council's positions reached us only a few hours ago. Our discussions thus far indicate that the positions of the Council and Parliament, expressed by the two competent committee", "2. Mid-term review of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme (\n- Before the vote on Amendment 14\nRiitta Myller\nrapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, as I see it, the Greens wanted to table an amendment to this, but the aim of this amendment is to include the last part of Amendment 8 in this amendment. In other words, it would not disappear from the text.\nThe voting list also has Amendment 8 replaced with Amendment 14. The intention is not to replace it but for the last part, which starts 'in addition to the short-term development costs', to be included in this report.\nPresident\nDid everyone understand? I am afraid I did not, either. Madam colleague, what do we do now?\nDid the Greens have something in mind? It seems not, just this once! Could you please repeat what you said, Mrs Myller?\nRiitta Myller\nRapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, the voting list also has Amendment 8 replaced with Amendment 14. The intention is not to replace it but for the last part, which starts 'in addition to the short-term development costs', to be included in this report.\nPresident\nI have just been told that is not the case. Shall we vote on Amendment 14, then? I have just been told by Paul Dunstan, who really is an expert on all these points of detail, that that is not possible. He recommends that we simply take the vote now.\n- Before the vote on Amendment 15\nSatu Hassi\nMr President, I propose as an oral amendment that Amendment 15 should not replace the original paragraph 51, but be added to that paragraph. I understand that the rapporteur agrees with this oral amendment.\n(The oral amendment was accepted)\n", "3. Mediation in civil and commercial matters (\n- Before the vote:\nArlene McCarthy\nrapporteur. - Mr President, there are no amendments to the common position. That is thanks to the excellent work between the Parliament, Council and Commission and the work particularly of my shadows, Mrs Wallis and Mr Gauz\u00e8s of the PPE-DE Group, who took a very strong line with the Council and Commission.\nI think it has been over a year since we agreed this proposal but it is the mediation experts and professionals in this sector whose response to the Parliament's first ever online consultation convinced us of the merits of this law. I know that they will now welcome today's vote in bringing these proposals into legislation.\nToo often we see cases where a marriage or a relationship involving children goes wrong and constituents end up with years of court procedures and massive legal fees. One of my constituents with a Greek partner amassed legal bills and had to go through the court system for three years to get her children back. Mediation can therefore be a valuable tool for citizens to achieve access to justice and potentially reduce the cost of dispute resolution without the often acrimonious process of going to trial.\nIt has the added benefit of freeing up court time for cases that require a court judgment. This new law should assist people across Europe in getting quick, affordable access to justice. I therefore urge Members to support the second reading and open up new avenues of redress and remedies for citizens across the EU.\n(Applause)\nPresident\nI would remind colleagues that in plenary the rapporteur is entitled to ask for the floor for two minutes, so could everyone please exercise the appropriate self-control. I believe however that Mr Rack has called for the floor on a point of order.\nReinhard Rack\n(DE) Mr President, normally, we would say that our machinery is not working, but in this particular case, it is the lifts which are not working. Very many of our colleagues ar", "13. EC-SADC EPA States Interim Economic Partnership Agreement (vote) \n- Before the vote on Amendment 13:\nKader Arif\n- (FR) Madam President, if Amendment 4 was an addition, then 14 and 8 should not lapse, and thus we would have voted on 14 and 8.\nPresident\n- The feeling is that the amendment with the addition covers the whole of the text. If you really want to vote on the original text, we can go back, but the general mood seems to be to carry on, I think.\nRobert Sturdy\n- Madam President, I am quite happy to carry on. I think it is covered.\nPresident\n- We will therefore keep going.\n", "Economic and social consequences of restructuring in the automobile sector in Europe (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the economic and social consequences of restructuring in the automobile sector in Europe.\nVladim\u00edr \u0160pidla\nMember of the Commission. (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the restructuring plan announced in November by Volkswagen to the board of the company's Belgian division and to the press will have a major social and economic impact within and beyond the company. Allow me to express, first of all, my very great concern about the consequences that this plan is likely to have for several thousand workers and their families, as well as for the company's economic and social environment.\nRestructuring is sometimes necessary in order to ensure companies' competitiveness and survival and, in the last analysis, in order to preserve jobs. I am aware of the need for Volkswagen, in common with many other European companies in the sector, to engage in restructuring. It is important, however, to ensure that this process is well planned and well administered in order to minimise its economic and social costs. That is why, in March 2005, the Commission adopted a communication entitled 'Restructuring and Employment', which set out the main features of a proactive strategy to which you have entirely subscribed, namely anticipation, partnership and the coordination of policies and instruments.\nAs soon as Volkswagen's management announced the restructuring, the Commission made every effort to mobilise the instruments at its disposal. I met the members of the Belgian Government in order to convey to them our solidarity and to emphasise the importance of complying with the applicable rules under Community law, particularly the directives on informing and consulting the workers' representatives. My colleague, Mrs H\u00fcbner, and myself also made it known that the services of the Commission were available to make flexible use of the instru", "One-minute speeches on matters of political importance\nPresident\nWe now come to the one-minute speeches on important political issues.\nEmmanouil Angelakas\n- (EL) Madam President, as you know, the talks in recent weeks between Greece and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, about the name to be used by the latter in its relations with all international organisations, have reached a sensitive stage. Discussions are taking place within the framework of UN decisions. During his recent visit to Skopje on 27 February, the EU's High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana, referred to Greece's declared intent to place a veto on that country's NATO accession prospects if the issue of the name is not settled first. He made comments which strike an odd note for anyone upholding European principles and values. He even said that he did not favour the veto.\nIn view of the fact that Greece has been an active, fully-fledged member of the EU for 27 years, we request that Mr Solana refrain from comments that hinder the negotiation process between a Member State and a country wishing to join NATO and the EU. We urge him to bear in mind that he represents the EU Member States, and call on him to respect their sensitivities and contribute towards resolving the issues, showing the Community solidarity that is expected of him and is his duty in view of the office he holds.\n(The President cut off the speaker)\nJaroslav Zv\u011b\u0159ina\n(CS) I just want to say that I am very alarmed by the attitude of some European Union politicians and Members of this Parliament towards the Czech Government's negotiations with the US regarding the visa waiver programme.\nAlthough our government has not breached a single provision of the Treaties, it has become an object of criticism, moralising and lecturing. This is spite of the fact that the negotiations took place with a country that has traditionally been a friend and ally of European democracies, not an enemy or a suspect ", "50th anniversary of the Tibetan uprising and dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese Government (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the oral question to the Commission on the 50th anniversary of the Tibetan uprising and dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese Government, by Marco Cappato, Marco Pannella and Janusz Onyszkiewicz, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and Monica Frassoni and Eva Lichtenberger, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance - B6-0012/2009).\nI should like to make a brief personal comment: I truly believe that our debate can contribute to the freedom of all Tibetan citizens and not to the domination of either a state or a religion.\nMarco Cappato\nMadam President, I share your hope. Unfortunately we cannot hope that the President-in-Office of the Council will take advantage of this debate and this discussion to help advance the position of the European Union. In fact the Czech Presidency evidently considers a common European policy to be a barrier to the great national foreign policies of our national states. China is grateful for this, Russia is grateful, that is to say repressive and anti-democratic countries all over the world give thanks for this absence of Europe that is so well illustrated by the absence of the Presidency in this House.\nI would like to point out to Mrs FerreroWaldner, as we tackle this point together, what is in my view the ultimate issue: it is not just a question of law and order - in other words looking at how many monks have been arrested and how many Tibetans have been killed recently due to brutal Chinese repression, hoping that the count will be lower than it was a year ago. What I would have liked to say to the Council and will now say to the Commission is that it must give an opinion on the fundamental political point, that is on the talks between the People's Republic of China and the envoys of the Dalai Lama, the aim of these talks and the", "Free trade agreement between the EU and the Republic of Korea (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the recommendation by Robert Sturdy, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the conclusion of the Free Trade Agreement between the European Union and its Member States and the Republic of Korea [08505/2010 - C7-0320/2010 - 2010/0075(NLE)].\nRobert Sturdy\nrapporteur. - Mr President, this FTA is the first of a new generation of trade agreements launched in 2007 as part of the global Europe initiative. Global economy, instability and a stagnated mutlilateral system have strengthened the need and pursuit for increased bilateral relations. It is the first FTA in which Parliament will exercise its new enhanced powers given to it by the Treaty of Lisbon.\nThe FTA is designed to provide EU businesses, in a wide variety of economic sectors, with extensive and comprehensive access to the South Korean market through a series of unprecedented tariff liberalisations. It guarantees WTO-plus disciplines in the case of, for example, geographical indicators, government procurement, greater transparency of state aid and strong enforcement of intellectual property rights, and contains an all-important chapter on sustainable development.\nHowever, while the many advantages are both immediate and conspicuous, I welcome more than anything else the fact that the FTA has an effective bilateral safeguard mechanism - a safeguard that allows the EU to restore MFN duty rates, should it be that this particular FTA has led to or threatens to cause serious injury to EU domestic industry. It is a safeguard that specifically addresses the concerns of Europe's sensitive sectors, including the auto industry, consumer electronics and textiles, and guarantees the protection they deserve. On this note I would like to thank Pablo Zalba Bidegain for the work that he did on this specific part of the agreement.\nThe South Korea market offers significant new opportunities for EU goods and services. I", "Council Question Time\nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B6-0448/2006).\nThe following questions have been submitted to the Council.\nSubject: Action by the Finnish Presidency in respect of children and their families\nWhat progress has the Finnish Presidency made towards enhancing the well-being of children and their families in the European Union?\nPaula Lehtom\u00e4ki\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, many of the decisions taken by the European Union have a direct or indirect effect on children's lives. Examples of this are laws on social protection, the job market, health, justice and gender equality. The harmonisation of family policy, work and family life and the promotion and preservation of good working conditions are also crucial to the welfare of children and families. These and other matters were on the agenda at the informal meeting in early July of the EU Ministers for Employment, Social Affairs and Health.\nMeasures that are effective and taken as early on as possible to eliminate poverty and social exclusion enhance the welfare of children and families with children. Last March the European Council stressed the need for action to eliminate child poverty, and this was also discussed at the Fifth European Round Table on Poverty and Social Exclusion held in mid-October. The subject was also included in the National Strategy Reports on Social Protection and Social Inclusion produced by the Member States for the Commission in September.\nThe harmonisation of work with family life is a major challenge in a changing job market. Child welfare means that both parents have to be responsible for the everyday life of the family. The Finnish Presidency has made fatherhood and the more equal involvement of men in family life the subject of debate. At the start of October a conference of experts was organised called 'Men and Gender Equality', and in December the Council's conclusions were adopted on it. During the Finnish Presidency the Commission forwarded a communic", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nRosado Fernandez\nMadam President, I would just like to say something, and I will speak in French so as to be more quickly understood by everyone.\nYesterday I raised a question which our 'Superior' - because I consider you a monk of this monastery - judged to be a personal matter. I must obey him and I do so with pleasure, in view of the liking I have for him. However it was not a personal matter, it was a political question. Indeed, when I speak as a politician, in a political context, I am no longer dealing with a personal matter which I can resolve in the corridors, but a political question which I cannot resolve with my fists in the corridors.\nMadam, that is what generally happens. I wanted to defend the honour of my party. I know very well that honour is not a fashionable thing, but all the same I wanted to defend it, and I did not want lies to be spread about my party, that is all. I thereby close the subject, in obedience to the Superior of the monastery and as the monk obedient to and respectful of democracy I am pleased to continue to be.\n\nPresident\nMr Rosado Fernandez, I admit that I have trouble deciding whether your speech was for a personal matter, a motion of procedure or a comment on the Minutes, but you have made it so politely that I am very willing to take note of it.\n\nRack\nMadam President, yesterday the President read out the ratification of the appointments of various Members, following verification of their credentials by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure. However, I see that we obviously have a new colleague in the House whom the President did not mention. Since yesterday, a young man has been sitting next to Mrs Green. I should like to know which group he belongs to, and I should also like to know what the PSE Group has done with Mr H\u00e4nsch!\n\nPresident\nMr Rack, I will reassure you doubly. We have not omitted to announce the ", "8. Legislation on Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE) and on related feed and food controls (\nCarl Schlyter\n(SV) I would like to point out that, in the Swedish version, paragraph 7, seventh indent, paragraph 8 and paragraph 21 contain several translation errors that mean that the Swedish version does not agree with the other versions in terms of policy and content. I am voting according to the English version and I hope that the translation into Swedish will be correct when this is made public.\n", "Derogations from internal market rules for defence procurement on the basis of Article 296 TEC (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on derogations from internal market rules for defence procurement on the basis of Article 296 TEC, by Arlene McCarthy, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection - B6-0122/2007).\nArlene McCarthy \nauthor. - Mr President, I am sorry Mr Booth has gone because I would like to tell him that I am a music lover and perhaps next time he could perform a Euro-rap when my report is up!\nAs the Commissioner is aware, the defence procurement market accounts for a large share of EU public procurement, estimated at about EUR 80 billion out of a combined Member State defence budget of EUR 170 billion, and that is why we are tabling this question today: defence procurement is still being awarded within mostly fragmented national markets.\nThe Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, therefore, takes note of the Commission's interpretative communication on the application of Article 296 of the Treaty in the field of defence procurement, adopted on 7 December 2006. This helped clarify the existing legal framework. However, we also further note efforts by the Commission to propose new legislation, which should substantially contribute to creating a more competitive environment for the European defence industry and its suppliers.\nTherefore, we want to ask the Commissioner the following questions. What progress is being made on the draft directive on the procurement of defence equipment not subject to the derogations of Article 296? What are the subsequent steps planned by the Commission in this area? How does the Commission evaluate, from the perspective of a fair and efficient working of the internal market, the situation within the European defence industry, where in different Member States a significant number of highly skilled jobs appear to be at risk? What ", "Transparency in financial matters (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Pom\u00e9s Ruiz, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on transparency in financial matters.\nJos\u00e9 Javier Pom\u00e9s Ruiz\nrapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, our European Parliament has always wished to implement a policy of transparency with regard to our funds, the EU's funds. Such was the case when, perhaps through mismanagement, problems arose that forced the Commission headed by Mr Santer to resign.\nSince then it must be said that things have improved considerably; this Parliament has propelled a policy of transparency, and the Commission has supported the Parliament. The result of this interest on the part of the Barroso Commission is the creation of nothing less than a Vice-Presidency to achieve this objective, represented here by Vice-President Siim Kallas, whom I welcome.\nEuropean citizens must know what we do with the very small amount of money they pay to the EU, what we do with that scant 1%; we must have more control over Community funds through visibility. Visibility is no longer just a notice hung up in a town hall or on a building site financed with regional funds or the Cohesion Fund; we have to go much further, and it must be possible to determine the whereabouts of that small amount of money provided by European taxpayers through Member States.\nThat is the Transparency Initiative, which this Parliament supports wholeheartedly. This own-initiative report we are submitting says two things. The first is that a little more must be done. In the text we have chosen to say that transparency must be manifested by the publication of black lists and information as to which tenderers have been accepted and which have been excluded, and OLAF must have a code to guarantee the presumption of innocence, which has not been the case on many occasions. In other words, within the EU, the European Parliament already has its own code of ethics. We are not officials, we are politicians", "EU-USA Air Services Agreement (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the EU-USA Air Services Agreement.\nJacques Barrot\nMr President, honourable Members, thanks to the work of your rapporteur, Mr El Khadraoui, and to the members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, the European Parliament has the opportunity today to make its voice heard regarding what I consider to be a major draft agreement between the European Union and the United States.\nI am talking about the aviation agreement reached ten days ago between the US and European negotiators, in Brussels. In less than ten days' time, I will be submitting this draft agreement for a political decision to the EU transport ministers.\nYour involvement has come at a crucial moment, and you can thus make the voice of Europeans heard, not only at the Council, but also within the US institutions themselves.\nThese negotiations have been long and complex. There have been four years of negotiations since the Court judgments in the so-called open skies affair. There have been 11 negotiating sessions, which have caused disruption and turbulence. However, this long negotiation can enable us to strengthen the transatlantic relationship and to make a positive contribution to the Lisbon Strategy.\nWithin our reach is the possibility for a European airline to fly from any European location to any US destination, without any restrictions, and the nationality of the European airline does not matter.\nToday, if you wish to fly between Brussels and Washington, you can only travel with a US or Belgian airline. Since Sabena went into liquidation, the absence of a Belgian carrier on that route has meant that you can only fly to Washington with a US airline.\nThat is why the Court of Justice ruled that these bilateral agreements were illegal. These agreements discriminate against our European airlines on the grounds of nationality. With this agreement, we are changing the way in which things are done. The United S", "Investigations conducted by the European Anti Fraud Office (OLAF) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Ingeborg Gr\u00e4\u00dfle, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) - C6-0228/2006 -.\nIngeborg Gr\u00e4\u00dfle\nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, good things come to those who wait. As rapporteur I am presenting 92 amendments to you today for the revision of the OLAF regulation, with the request that you approve them. This is the first reform of the Anti-Fraud Office since it was established and affects what lies at the very heart of the office, in other words the regulation that controls the essential activities of OLAF.\nThe European Parliament has given itself two years to revise this regulation, because OLAF issues always represent dangerous territory for us. I am proud of the fact that we in the European Parliament and in the Committee on Budgetary Control were genuinely able to agree and that we remain in agreement. We have not fallen out about the details or generally got into a muddle, as the Council often does. We agree on the objective of the reform which is to create a more efficient office that can carry out its important tasks more effectively.\nWe stand by the office. We want it to remain in place and we also want it to be able to carry out its tasks. I would like to thank all the employees of OLAF, including the Director General, for their work and to assure them that we need their work. I would also like to thank all my fellow Members, the shadow rapporteurs, the consultants and the committee secretariat and, of course, my own employees who have shown such commitment to this issue. I would like to thank all of you for your wide-ranging support for this work, because this support will represent a success for this Parliame", "A new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe (continuation of debate) \nPresident\nWe now continue with the debate on the report by Salvador Garriga Polledo on a new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe.\nFran\u00e7ois Alfonsi\n(FR) Mr President, the report by Mr Garriga Polledo, and I thank him and congratulate him on his work, is an ambitious summary that looks to the future.\nIndeed, his report calls for greater resources so that the Union can better implement its objectives as set out in the Treaty of Lisbon. It forcefully raises the question of own resources and therefore, indeed, the issue of whether our institution enjoys freedom in its fundamental political act, that of voting on its budget. It proposes extending and expanding common policies, in particular, cohesion policy which has made a major contribution in the past to making the European Union a model of cooperation and understanding between peoples, and may continue to do so in the future.\nWith the future Multiannual Financial Framework, if we listen to the European Parliament, cohesion policy will be able to move into a new phase thanks to the creation of intermediate regions. Thus, we propose a new package for this fund which strengthens equal opportunities between all our European territories, regardless of their past in economic terms, regardless of their handicaps when compared with more developed regions and regardless of how vulnerable they may be to the economic crisis that we are experiencing at present or any crisis that we may have to face in the future.\nCohesion among the different territories of the European Union is a key, strategic objective on which the very future of Europe depends. The proposals that have been made are a step in the right direction, and if they are acted upon, lay sound foundations for the future.\nMr President, the vote on the report by Mr Garriga will be a simple choice: ch", "Amendment of the agenda\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, this morning, a meeting of the Conference of Presidents was held. We finished the conference 10 minutes ago. We discussed very thoroughly the questions of organising the vote on the resolutions on the Europe 2020 strategy. As you very well know, it is a strategy which is intended to bring our citizens work, prosperity and stability throughout the Union for a whole decade. So it is a crucial strategy for the future situation in the European Union, and also for outside the Union, because we can only be strong if we are strong internally.\nIn relation to the discussion during the meeting of the Conference of Presidents, arguments were put forward for voting on our resolutions on the Europe 2020 strategy today, because we would like to have them as quickly as possible so that we can participate responsibly in the discussion being held on this subject with other European institutions. However, there were also arguments saying that we need a strategy which we will adopt by a huge majority. If we want to influence the situation in the Union, we have to organise a big majority which supports the resolutions.\nThere is a fear that there may not be such a majority, today. So, on the one hand, we need the strategy as quickly as possible and, on the other, we want a strong resolution. This is what we need.\nIn relation to this responsible discussion among the chairs of our political groups, I have decided to submit a proposal that the debate be postponed. This is in accordance with Rule 140 of our Rules of Procedure.\nI will say this again: the decision is very important, because we realise the resolution is needed quickly, but we need a resolution which has strong support, and these matters are of great importance.\nJoseph Daul\nMr President, thank you for your statement. I should like to add that our Hungarian friends are in the same situation as our Polish friends in terms of floods. We therefore have the same thoughts for ou", "Applied research relating to the common fisheries policy (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is a short presentation of the report by Mrs Migu\u00e9lez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on applied research relating to the common fisheries policy.\nRosa Migu\u00e9lez Ramos\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, reconciling the correct preservation of ecosystems with sustainable exploitation of marine resources, preventing and controlling the impact of human activity on the environment, improving knowledge and technological development and innovation are tasks that cannot be tackled if we do not have the support of the European scientific community.\nFisheries research is also vital when drawing up recommendations and providing scientific advice to legislators. Greater investment in research and development, and in the collection and processing of reliable data, would result in a more solid and sustainable Common Fisheries Policy.\nHowever, although the phrase that I heard from the mouth of a scientist ('Not money, but human resources are the problem') paints a good picture of the situation, I will not be the one to say that research in fisheries has plenty of financial resources. Instead, I will say that we have a dual problem.\nFirstly, Commissioner, the amounts laid down in the Seventh Framework Programme for marine research, which should have been a cross-cutting issue, seem to be insufficient for the integrated approach that is currently desired for this issue.\nMoreover, Commissioner, scientists - and I assure you that I have talked to many of them in order to draw up this report, both before and during the process - have problems when submitting projects to the Seventh Framework Programme. These problems can partly be attributed, on the one hand, to the different focus that is required for aquaculture, which is basically industrial in nature, and on the other hand, to research into fisheries and marine science, which is multidisciplinary in ", "2. Third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of Member States (\nTanja Fajon\nrapporteur. - Mr President, we have a very important vote ahead of us and I would kindly ask colleagues to lend strong support to granting a visa-free regime to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania. Those countries deserve it.\nI would like to welcome the Foreign Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr Sven Alkalaj, and the President of the Albanian Parliament, Jozefina Topalli. It is they who will deliver the positive news from our institution.\n(Applause)\n", "Data protection (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on data protection.\nPaula Lehtom\u00e4ki\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, matters relating to data protection have had a high profile during the Finnish presidential term. On the one hand, the Presidency has encountered challenges relating to the subject and previously known to us, such as taking forward the Framework Decision on data protection under the third pillar. On the other hand, we have faced situations where the Presidency has had to respond quickly and as the circumstances have demanded. Examples of this are the negotiation of the new agreement on passenger name record (PNR) data with the United States of America, and the matter of bank transfer data by SWIFT.\nThe Finnish Presidency is aware that the European Parliament has said in several contexts that it considers the Framework Decision on data protection under the third pillar and its speedy adoption to be very important. The proposal for the Framework Decision has been one of the priorities of our Presidency in the area of justice and home affairs. It was our ambitious goal to reach agreement on the Framework Decision during Finland's term.\nWe have taken much time and trouble this autumn to take this proposal for a Framework Decision forward. During our term the first reading was brought to a conclusion, and it went through a second and third reading. In addition, on several occasions the Article 36 Committee and the Permanent Representatives Committee were asked to look at individual questions relating to the matter.\nDespite these efforts, the timetable proved too tight. Obviously, consensus will not be reached now during the Finnish Presidency, and the debate on the Framework Decision will be taken up in the German term.\nThe proposal for a Framework Decision is a broad and multilateral package, whose impact on police cooperation, as well as cooperation on crime and the protection of data of those registered, wil", "Company law (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on company law.\nBenita Ferrero-Waldner\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, the European private company statute has regularly been on the agenda of the European Parliament and also, as you know, on that of its Committee on Legal Affairs. Various arguments presented during these debates have demonstrated that a statute for European private companies may bring benefits to small and medium-sized companies, and there has also been support for the idea of a stakeholder consultation.\nThe Commission recognises that the regulatory framework needs to be adapted to allow SMEs to make the most of increasingly integrated European markets. We need to make it easier and cheaper for small and medium-sized companies to conduct cross-border business. It is important to take action that will help those firms to fully reap the benefits of the single market.\nThe growth of small and medium-sized businesses is crucial, as we all know, for the competitiveness of the European economy, and the Commission can see that a European private company statute could facilitate the expansion of small businesses beyond national borders. Therefore, by providing an option, it would create more choice for companies, without imposing any additional burdens.\nIt could well reduce the compliance costs for firms that wish to operate in several Member States. If this can be achieved, SMEs could have easier access to new markets. The Commission is therefore aware of the importance of the European private company statute to the Member States of the European Union and to European businesses.\nI can assure you that my colleague, Commissioner McCreevy, will proceed with a legislative proposal for a European private company statute, as he declared to the Legal Affairs Committee on 3 October 2007. This proposal should be ready by mid-2008 at the latest. As you know, we are currently conducting further consultations on the exact form and co", "The situation in Palestine (debate) \nPresident\nCommissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have all been deeply moved and disturbed by the terrible events and tragic occurrences in the Gaza Strip over the last few days. As you know, I chose to make the Middle East the destination for my first official trip outside the European Union and visited the region. My meeting with Mr Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority, was originally scheduled to take place in Ramallah, but, because of increasing hostilities between Fatah and Hamas, he asked me to visit him at his official residence in Gaza, where he was trying to mediate between the opposing factions, and that is what I did. It was exactly three weeks ago that I was having talks with President Abbas in Gaza, when I was impressed by the calm determination with which he explained his convictions to me, yet, once outside his official apartments, I could feel the tension in the air.\nMy recommendation to you, Members of this House, is that you condemn the Hamas militias' violent attacks on the legitimate security forces and the institutions of the Palestinian Authority in the strongest terms, and it is out of the deepest conviction that I recommend that you express our support for President Abbas and our solidarity with him.\nWe support the Palestinian President's decision to announce a state of emergency and appoint an emergency government in order to be able to resolve as soon as possible the political crisis in the Palestinian territories. The new prime minister, Mr Salam Fayyad, recently visited me in Brussels; we have great confidence in him and in his leadership qualities, and, should you mandate me to do so, I shall say so to him today.\nThe new government has a difficult task; it will need active assistance from the European Union and from the international community, and I should like to say, following on from the conclusions adopted at yesterday's Council of Foreign Ministers in Luxembourg, that we in this Hous", "Award of the Sakharov Prize (Formal sitting) \nPresident\nHonourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, for almost two decades the European Parliament has been awarding the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to men and women from all parts of the world who campaign for human rights, freedom of speech and freedom of expression.\nI am delighted to bid a very warm welcome today, here in the European Parliament, to the winner of the Sakharov Prize for 2007, Salih Mahmoud Osman.\n(Applause)\nIt also gives me great pleasure to extend my warmest greetings to his wife, Salwa Ahmed Faragalla Ali, who has always stood by his side at difficult times in his life. We welcome you among us.\n(Applause)\nThe decision to award the 2007 Sakharov Prize to Salih Mahmoud Osman was taken unanimously by the Conference of Presidents, which comprises the chairs of the political groups, on the basis of a proposal adopted by a large number of Members of the European Parliament from various groups. The European Parliament has thereby reaffirmed its solidarity with the people in Darfur and its conviction that a sustainable solution for that region can only be achieved through justice, democracy and respect for human rights.\nThe conflict that has plagued Darfur since 2003 is exacerbating the plight of a country devastated by more than twenty years of civil war. As with most conflicts, it is the civilian population who have suffered most from militia raids, the destruction of villages, scorched-earth policies and forcible displacements.\nThe conflict has claimed at least 400 000 lives and has been responsible for more than two and a half million displaced persons and refugees, notwithstanding the signing of the peace agreement in Darfur in 2006.\nJust like the European Parliament, the winner of the 2007 Sakharov Prize does not simply accept this unjust situation but protests against the impunity of those who caused it. For years Salih Mahmoud Osman has been defending the rights of victims of the conflict i", "Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law\nPresident\nThe next item is the debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law.\n", "Moratorium on the death penalty (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on the moratorium on the death penalty.\nG\u00fcnter Gloser\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, what I have to talk to you about today is one of the most fundamental components of the European Union's policy on human rights, and the many motions for a resolution tabled by the various groups in your House indicate just how live an issue this is.\nTaking as its basis the guidelines for the EU's policy in respect of third states and the death penalty as adopted in 1998 by its Council of Ministers, the European Union is campaigning worldwide for the abolition of the death penalty under all circumstances, and the declaration of moratoria has for some years been a consistent feature of that campaign - albeit not as its main objective, but as an intermediate stage on the way to the practice's abolition once and for all.\nThe European Union will continue its policy of protection for human rights under German Presidency and will therefore be arguing forcefully for moratoria on the death penalty and for its permanent abolition.\nThat means that we will, on the one hand, continue to pursue the debate on the issue of principle - not only on bilateral contact but also in multilateral fora, the United Nations in particular - whilst also, on the other hand, continuing to be pro-active in approaching those countries that are at a turning point - that is to say, those in which either positive or negative trends are perceptible as regards the death penalty - and to bring influence to bear on them by means, that is, of very definite demarches in many urgent individual cases.\nI am aware that your House has been a constant advocate for this policy and am glad to be able to say that we have already, together, achieved a great deal. The fact that, in something like two-thirds of the world's countries, the death penalty has been legally abolished or is in practice a dead letter is attributable", "Mainstreaming sustainability in development cooperation policies (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by DanutBudreikait\u0117, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on mainstreaming sustainability in development cooperation policies.\nDanutBudreikait\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank all who have found the time at this late hour to discuss here in the plenary session the important question of integrating sustainability into development cooperation policy. The most important EU documents - the European Community Treaty and the EU Sustainable Development Strategy - define sustainable development as development which allows the present needs of society to be satisfied without reducing the chances of future generations to meet their needs. Sustainable development is an all-embracing EU rights principle which should have an influence on all spheres of EU policy, including the development cooperation policy.\nOne of the most important aims of our community is to fight poverty in the world, to pay back some old debts to developing countries, to help them climb out of the status of least-developed nations and to reach the status of developing nations, and ultimately - the level of developed nations. Developed nations know what the cost of progress and modern life is. I have in mind the environmental impact of human activity - the development of various fields of economy, especially industry. It is a huge cost that is being borne by the whole world, even though not all countries have or use the technology that contributes to the greenhouse effect, CO2 or other pollution. We are all paying, and we all would like to see the amount of pollution reduced. We direct our attention not only to our own economies, adopting appropriate solutions, but we also want developing countries to use non-polluting renewable types of energy and non-polluting technology. However, this is not so simple. The report raised some of the problems of sustainable developm", "2. Nepal (\nRa\u00fcl Romeva i Rueda\nauthor. - Mr President, I have several oral amendments.

Professor Lucas Pires had been a member of our Parliament since Portugal joined the European Union and was twice its Vice-President. He brought a brilliant and cultivated mind to the ideal of European construction, and enriched our Parliamentary debates by contributing the historical experience of one of the oldest European nations.\nThe example of Francisco Lucas Pires, whose last public act was to open the European Union pavilion at 'Expo 98' , will remain with us as a model of European citizenship, and as a man deeply committed to his country's causes, but always able to understand and defend the imperatives of European construction.\nThe flag of the European Union is being flown at half-mast in his honour. I would ask you to observe a minute's silence in his memory.\n(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)\n\nApproval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of Friday, 15 May 1998 have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nR\u00fcbig\nMr President, I would just like to have recorded in the minutes that during our last week in Strasbourg the French police did a splendid job of guarding the European Parliament, and that they were visibly present in the proximity of the Parliament.\n\nMedina Ortega\nMr President, the employees of the company Air France have announced that they will be on strike for two weeks, starting from next Monday. If this strike takes place, we MEPs will not be able to get to Strasbourg for the next part-session.

I am doing this, and last week I spoke to ", "Appointments of ESA senior executives (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on the appointments of ESA senior executives.\nEnik\u0151 Gy\u0151ri\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner and the honourable Members - my dear ex-colleagues - for giving me the opportunity to comment, on behalf of the Council, on the appointment process of the chairs and executive directors of the new European Supervisory Authorities - the ESAs - and on the principles that should guide the performance of their duties.\nThe ESA regulations, which we adopted less than three months ago, give no specific role to the Council in the appointments of the chair and executive director of each ESA, which are made by the respective board of supervisors.\nHence, in accordance with the ESA regulations, the chairperson of each ESA is appointed by the board of supervisors. Furthermore, the ESA regulations give a crucial role to the European Parliament, which has been granted the possibility of objecting to the appointment of those senior executives and of removing a chairperson from office following a decision of the board of supervisors.\nWhere, then, does the Council stand in this scenario? Well, the Council, as co-legislator, has agreed with Parliament to insert in these regulations provisions that aim to ensure that members of the board of supervisors - the management board - the chairperson and the executive director of each ESA are protected by, and bound to, strict independence so as to act solely in the interests of the Union.\nI will not quote in full the provisions of those regulations, and more particularly Articles 42, 46, 49 and 52, but their spirit is clear. This is that neither the voting members of the boards, nor the chairperson or executive director, shall seek or take instructions from EU institutions or bodies, Member State governments or any public or private body, and that these, in turn, shall not seek to infl", "Annual report on human rights (2008) - EU policies in favour of human rights defenders - Trade in goods used for torture - (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on:\nthe statement by the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy: Annual report on human rights (2008),\nthe report by Mrs Hautala, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on EU policies in favour of human rights defenders [2009/2199 (INI)],\nthe oral question to the Council by Mr Albertini, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and Mr Moreira, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade on the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 - B7-0303/2010), and\nthe oral question to the Commission by Mr Albertini, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and Mr Moreira, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade on the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 - B7-0304/2010).\nHeidi Hautala\nrapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, I would like to say how pleased I am with this debate, in which we can discuss the European Union's human rights strategy in depth. I am very glad that Baroness Ashton is here and taking part in the discussion and is presenting her annual report.\nBefore that, I wish to present the report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, whose purpose it is to improve the protection of human rights defenders. Every day, we here in Parliament receive petitions from around the world regarding how we might protect people who often put their own lives at risk because they are speaking up for human rights. The petitions come from all continents. Often, we cannot even precisely tell who the human rights defender is, and it is important that we accept that there are very many types: journalists, lawyers, ordinary brave women and men, who set aside their own interests and stand up for human rights - more often than not, the human rights of others.\nIt was a real privilege for", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nViktor Uspaskich\n(LT) Mr President, I would like to announce that I support this decision, although my card was not working to begin with and that is why I want to announce this. Now to the matter in hand. Ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on a change to the annual accounting responsibilities of micro-entities. This project caused stormy debate at almost all levels, both in European Union and Member State institutions. I am convinced that we must prepare common European Union rules. However, I would like to underline that by reducing the administrative burden on micro-entities, we must not infringe conditions for fair competition in either the internal markets of Member States or the European Union market. I think that a single tax should be created for micro-entities, which already exists in some states. If it could be calculated, it could be calculated either on the basis of the number of employees or turnover or territory, depending on the type of business. As a result, those companies would no longer be tempted to engage in illegal activities.\nPeter Jahr\n(DE) Mr President, with the option of relieving micro-enterprises of the obligation to produce annual balance sheets, the European Parliament is clearly coming out in favour of the abolition of superfluous bureaucracy. With an EU-wide relief of approximately EUR 6.3 billion, we are also providing a tangible stimulus towards growth in Europe's small and medium-sized enterprise sector. Since the Member States are able to decide individually about this exemption from the obligation to produce annual balance sheets, I expect that as many countries as possible, especially Germany, will make use of this option. This arrangement will not only enable the enterprises in question to save time and costs amounting to around EUR 2 000 per company; it is also a very good example of how Europe is more citizen-friendly ", "27.

It is true that most developing countries have opened up their economies, but they remain trapped in the production of commodities with low added value and plagued by the lack of a skilled workforce. Developing countries must, therefore, increase their production capacities and diversify their economies through better application of innovation and new technologies in agriculture, production and services.\nAt present, African scientists do not participate sufficiently in international research and development projects, including those that receive the financial backing of the European Union. This is due in part to the lack of expertise in building the necessary research capacity, networks and partnerships and to shortcomings in dealing with intellectual property rights, contracts, technology transfer and the dissemination of research results.\nIt must be stressed, however, that global problems such as infectious diseases and biodiversity can only be solved successfully with the participation of these countries.\nAfrican politicians are aware of this and are doing their best to make science and technology a priority. The African Ministerial Conference on Science and Technology held in September 2005 adopted a new Consolidated Plan of Action for NEPAD, the New Partnership for Africa's Development. In addition, last year, in January 2007, the Commission of the African Union appealed to Africa at the African Union summit to take the initiative to build large science and technology capacit", "Reform of EU trade policy instruments (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the oral question to the Commission by Mr Bar\u00f3n Crespo, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the Commission Green Paper and public consultation on a possible reform of EU trade policy instruments B6-0009/2007).\nIgnasi Guardans Camb\u00f3 \ndeputising for the author. - Mr President, we have asked for this debate to examine the background and the purpose of the Green Paper adopted by the Commission on 6 December 2006.\nWith the Green Paper, the Commission intends to stimulate a debate over the use of trade defence instruments in Europe: countervailing, anti-dumping and safeguard measures. I believe that this is a commendable initiative and I am convinced of the value of this debate. We need to talk much more about trade policy and about the choices made by the European Commission and by the Council and we need to ensure that decisions are properly discussed before this Parliament. We need to give this Parliament more power and to make trade policy more subject to democratic scrutiny.\nWe are all living through a moment which many view as some sort of crisis period. We are living through a time when Europeans are asking themselves: what does Europe represent and why do we need such a complicated thing as the European Union in the first place? And, when these legitimate concerns are raised, the importance of the role of a united EU in the globalised world and the importance of having a single voice to represent and defend the interests of 500 million citizens in any negotiation with other trade partners in the world market are vital factors to be considered.\nGlobal trade and its impact on the lives of our citizens and on the future of our businesses, big, medium-sized and small, play an essential role in the anxieties felt by many over what we usually call 'globalisation'. And, while many of us believe that some of the criticism is no more than cheap demagogy, we must understand those an", "Commission Green Paper on the management of bio-waste in the European Union (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Jos\u00e9 Manuel Fernandes, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Commission Green Paper on the management of bio-waste in the European Union.\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Fernandes\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to salute and thank all those speaking about this report, which resulted in a large majority in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety: 55 votes for, 3 against and no abstentions. I am grateful for the work and involvement that has made its content possible.\nBio-waste accounts for approximately 30% of urban solid waste. More than 100 000 tonnes are produced each year. We must not forget that waste is responsible for more than 109 million tonnes of greenhouse gases. It is the fourth most important source of greenhouse gas emissions, after energy, industry and agriculture.\nBio-waste should be viewed as a potential resource. Bio-waste should be used to its full potential. Unfortunately, up to now, large amounts of waste have been deposited in landfill and this has had environmental costs.\nThe legislation on this is non-cohesive. We have legislation that is in various legislative texts and which requires harmonisation, legislation that requires and imposes clarity - another type of clarity - and greater simplicity. That is why we are advocating a specific directive; a directive that brings with it certainty and legal security for public and private investors, whilst respecting local specificities and the principle of subsidiarity.\nHowever, this directive is essential. In this report, we obviously advocate the hierarchy of waste and, not least, prevention, which must be viewed in a broad way.\nThe best waste is waste that will never become waste. That is the reason why the public has options, for example, to ensure that gardens wher", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nFrancesco De Angelis\n(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Schaldemose for her report which, above all, must be praised for proposing concrete measures to strengthen the surveillance systems for movement within the common European market of products that are safe for European consumers.\nIt is an own-initiative report but it has the merit of going in the right direction to complete the single market and the protection of European consumers. Ensuring safety means providing traceability systems that are reliable throughout the products' life cycle. In this respect, the report puts forward effective proposals: the creation of an information database on product safety; the strengthening of the Community Rapid Information System (RAPEX) regarding unsafe products from third countries; and greater resources to allow the surveillance authorities to withdraw products with serious risks from the market.\nI will conclude by emphasising that it is our job to ensure that the products circulating on the European market are safe for the most vulnerable consumers, especially children, the elderly and the disabled.\nJaros\u0142aw Kalinowski\n(PL) Madam President, there has been much discussion of the safety of consumers in relation to food products, yet we sometimes forget that normal items of everyday use can pose an equally serious threat to health, and sometimes even to life, particularly in the case of small children. The basic tool used to monitor goods placed on the market is continuous market surveillance, and appropriate legislation is essential, particularly with regard to the monitoring of e-commerce.\nIt goes without saying that appropriate cooperation between consumer organisations, national authorities, manufacturers and sellers is essential. Let us not be overzealous, however, and let us instead give calm consideration to a definition of a hazardous product.

In October 2006 the Commission produced an action plan for energy efficiency, proposing a 20% improvement in energy efficiency by 2020 and setting out 10 priority areas for action. These ranged from appliances to buildings and transport and included financial incentives, energy efficiency awareness and much more. EU Heads of State endorsed the Commission's action plan last March and energy efficiency made the headlines because Chancellor Merkel declared that inefficient incandescent light bulbs should be banned.\nNow it is the Parliament's turn to assess the action plan. I hope that our report will send out a strong signal about what MEPs want to see happen on energy efficiency. The first signal that this report makes is that some of the Commission's proposals do not quite go far enough. I would like to give three examples. Firstly, the proposal to revise the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive: the Commission proposes minimum energy performance requirements for buildings and for building components, which is good. Buildings are key to cutting energy demand. Over 40% of the energy we use is consumed in buildings and 75% of the buildings standing today will still be here in 2050, so we need to tackle energy efficiency in existing buildings as well as in new stock.

I would begin by thanking my colleague Adriana Poli Bortone, now a senator of the Italian Republic, from whom I inherited the draft report and an already detailed, meticulous study of the topic; next my staff, who have supported me enthusiastically and conscientiously in furthering my exploration and analysis of the phenomenon; and finally the shadow rapporteurs, whose commitment undoubtedly contributed to the adoption of the text in the Committee on the Environment, with a virtually unanimous cross-party consensus.\nLadies and gentlemen, when this draft text was entrusted to me, I asked myself what my aim should be as rapporteur in carrying forward a study of this kind. I found an answer in the strategic nature of the document, which showed me the two pillars on which I came to base my work: firstly completeness, so as not to leave any gaps or underestimate the importance of any of the numerous aspects of the subject in hand; and practicality, so as to be able to draw up a genuinely future-oriented document identifying effective instruments and solutions.\nIn adopting this approach I relied on the data, statistics and percentages already widely available on the topic. The percentages are discomfiting once we look into them since, according to the World Health Organisation, more than 1 billion people are overweight and over 300 million are obese. Child obesity is growing rapidly, and we should bear in mind that diseases related to ", "1. Youth in Action programme (2007-2013) (\n- Before the vote:\nKaterina Batzeli\nrapporteur. - Mr President, with regard to the four reports to be voted on, let me point out on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education that the multiannual programmes in the field of culture, education, youth and citizen participation in community activities are some of the most important activities of the EU and especially of the European Parliament.\nDecisions on the choice and funding of the different activities covered by these programmes ought thus to rely on clear and objective criteria. Simplified procedures should be adopted to avoid unnecessary delays for European citizens.\nThe four comitology reports, which the European Parliament is being asked to adopt today in plenary, aim to ensure transparent, fast and effective procedures. This will simultaneously strengthen the European Parliament's role in this field of procedures.\nThe fact that these parliamentary proposals have been accepted by both the Commission and the Council is particularly satisfying and gives hope for future interinstitutional agreement.\nFinally, I would like to thank the Commission, the Council under the Slovenian Presidency, and the current French Presidency for the spirit of cooperation and agreement and for the way they have managed these four Community programmes.\n", "Decision on urgent procedure\nAmended Proposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing for the period 2007-2013 the specific programme 'Fight against violence (Daphne) and drugs prevention and information' as part of the General programme 'Fundamental Rights and Justice' - C6 0095/2005 -\nProposal for a Council Decision establishing for the period 2007-2013 the specific programme 'Fundamental rights and citizenship' as part of the general programme 'Fundamental Rights and Justice' - C6-0236/2005 -\nProposal for a Council Decision establishing for the period 2007-2013 the specific programme 'Criminal justice' as part of the general programme 'Fundamental Rights and Justice' - C6-0237/2005 -\nProposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing for the period 2007-2013 the specific programme 'Civil justice' as part of the general programme 'Fundamental Rights and Justice' - C6-0096/2005 -\nProposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and the Council establishing the European Refugee Fund for the period 2008-2013 as part of the General programme 'Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows' - C6-0124/2005 -\nProposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and the Council establishing the External Borders Fund for the period 2007-2013 as part of the general programme 'Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows' - C6-0125/2005 -\nProposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and the Council establishing the European Refugee Fund for the period 2007-2013 as part of the general programme 'Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows' - C6-0238/2005 -\nProposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and the Council establishing the European Return Fund for the period 2008-2013 as part of the general programme 'Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows' - C6-0126/2005 -\nProposal for a Council Decision establishing the specific Programme 'Prevention, Preparedness and Consequence Management of Terro", "9.

I hope that you all can accept this oral amendment. It is important for me, it is important for the ALDE Group, and it is especially important for my country, Sweden, if we are ever going to join the euro.\n(The oral amendment was accepted)\nPresident\nThat concludes the vote.\nBecause the voting has gone on so long, as a result of your excellent work, I would like to ask those who have requested to give explanations of vote to change these explanations from oral to written or postpone your turn until tomorrow, because 62 requests have been put forward and we are unable to deal with them all.\nMicha\u0142 Tomasz Kami\u0144ski\nMr President, I would like to congratulate you on the excellent job you did today. I really appreciate the way you exercised your chairmanship today, and I hope you will share your wonderful skills with other vice-chairs of Parliament.\nNicole Sinclaire\nMr President, I have voted today and my constituents can see how I voted today, so therefore, they should have the opportunity to have my explanation of vote today.\nPresident\nI made a request that you should change your oral explanation into a written explanation. This will still allow you to give your constituents the reasons that prompted you and others to vote in a certain way on the various issues. We do not wish in any way to deprive you of any rights. I only ask you to join the other MEPs who are giving up their right to make an oral explanation in order to give a written explanation. That is all.\nBarbara Matera\n(IT", "\nMaes\nMr President, I wanted to ask you about a non-profit association that calls itself the non-profit association pension fund. Members of the European Parliament, I believe that pension funds have already been discussed here in the European Parliament a number of times, and that we are in a transitional phase. That is why I am extremely bemused to find an invitation from Mr Balfe here for a meeting that he is going to have with the non-profit association pension fund. I wanted to ask whether Parliament provides the interpreters and covers the expenses for meetings of this kind, and whether this non-profit association continues to be supported in any way by Parliament.\n\nPresident\nThank you very much Mrs Maes. Your comments have been noted by the Bureau. As you can imagine, at the moment, and in these circumstances, the Bureau is not in a position to be able to give you an answer. This is not an individual decision, taken by the President-in-Office. It is decided on by the Bureau as a whole. You will receive an appropriate answer when the time is right.\n\nAdoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nGaleote Quecedo\nMr President, it appears from yesterday' s Minutes that Mr Bar\u00f3n Crespo replied to an intervention of mine from the previous day.\nDo not worry, Mr President, I am not going to exercise my right to reply to personal references. And furthermore, I confess I do not have the parliamentary skill to reply to a personal reference within 24 hours. I simply wish, through his colleagues, to offer him my willingness to co-operate.\n\nPresident\nThank you very much, Mr Galeote. You have asked a question, as is your right, but you must understand that I am not really in a position to give you the answer you would like.

The Group of the European People's Party has also requested the inclusion of its oral question on the same subject. I would point out that this was originally scheduled for Friday. However, the request is for the oral question on the Convention on human rights and biomedicine to be taken at the start of the present sitting.\n\nRoth\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe is to meet from 23 to 27 September and will be looking at the draft Bioethics Convention, among other things. Parliament has already held lengthy and detailed discussions on this extremely important issue, but we have unfortunately not yet delivered an opinion on the subject, having failed to adopt the Pelttari report at the July partsession.\nWe feel it is absolutely essential for the European Parliament to state its position on this issue, which has such far-reaching implications for the future of mankind. We are therefore proposing that our group's oral question should be put on the agenda for this week, and I also hope that the Christian Democrats will propose the same for the PPE Group's question. The European Parliament must say something, otherwise the Council of Europe will simply decide what it wants and we shall be left without any official position whatsoever, which would be completely irresponsible of us.\nWe have requested, pursuant to Rule 96 of the Rules of Pr", "Welcome\nPresident\nToday, it is my honour to welcome a delegation of the Pan-African Parliament to our Parliament. As you all know, the Pan-African Parliament is to the African Union what the European Parliament is to the European Union.\nI am particularly pleased to welcome Mr Khumalo and his parliamentary colleagues here today, as it gives me an opportunity to thank him and his colleagues, and thereby also the President of the Pan-African Parliament, Mrs Mongella, for the welcome I received in October 2008, during my visit to the Pan-African Parliament, as well as for the invitation to speak at the plenary session of the Pan-African Parliament.\nOnce again, I would like to sincerely bid you all welcome. I am very happy that you are here with us today.\n(Applause)\n", "Explanations of vote\nPresident\nThe next item is the explanations of vote.\nJosu Ortuondo Larrea\n(ES) Mr President, the European Union's fundamental motto is 'United in diversity'. Since its origins we have been trying to build a common area, and not just an economic area but, above all, an area of life opportunities and freedom. We are doing so amongst people and nations that have many things in common; I am not just referring to the strategic, political and social interests that we share, but also to our values, habits and ways of looking at life.\nWe have a common cultural background based on Greek thought, Roman law, Christianity, the Reformation, the Enlightenment, the Renaissance and even globalisation. At the same time, however, there is no question that we still have cultural differences and special identities and, in particular, our own languages. This diversity, though it could be seen as just an obstacle, is in fact a source of great wealth and vitality.\nAlthough it has not been approved, I have therefore voted in favour of the proposal that the European Union Treaty be modified, so that there can be Community legislation in the field of respect and protection for languages, particularly minority languages, as well as the creation of a European Agency for Linguistic Diversity and Multilingualism.\nI have also voted in favour of promoting the learning by all European citizens of at least two other languages in addition to their own, since I believe that that is the best way to bring about mutual understanding, co-existence and unity.\nMichl Ebner\n(DE) Mr President, on the subject of multilingualism, I welcome the adoption of this report by Mr Joan i Mar\u00ed. Indeed, I voted in favour of it, albeit with a number of reservations, which I still have. I believe that neither the European Commission nor Members during the vote in this House - the majority, at least - showed sufficient courage on a number of amendments. Multilingualism is a precondition for tolerance and", "Organ donation and transplantation: Policy actions at EU level (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Adamos Adamou, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on organ donation and transplantation: Policy actions at EU level.\nAdamos Adamou\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me first thank the European Commission for its communication and the excellent cooperation we have had together. I should also like to thank all my colleagues, particularly the shadow rapporteurs, for the very difficult work we have done together to reach the compromise amendments which have been unanimously adopted.\nThe main issues the Commission deals with in its communication and which I have been dealing with as rapporteur are: transplant risks and safety, for instance the transmission of diseases, the organ shortage and illegal organ trafficking. Permit me to talk about each of these in turn.\nWith regard to quality and safety, when organs are used in therapy diseases risk being transmitted to the recipient. Donor testing is therefore important to minimise the risks to the recipient. Donors must be screened to establish whether or not there is a risk of any disease being transmitted. To establish a standard of donor safety, a minimum set of examinations should be performed. We must point out, however, that there is no consensus today between the Member States on these tests.\nThe severe shortage of organ donors remains the main challenge facing Member States in organ transplantation. Growing waiting lists are a serious problem. The establishment of an efficient system to identify those who might become organ donors on their death, provided, of course, that all the mandatory consent requirements in Member States have been met, is thus a key element in fighting organ shortage.\nAnother important option to increase the number of donors is the possible promotion of altruistic donations from living people. Careful consideration is al", "Shareholders' voting rights (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Klaus-Heiner Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the exercise of voting rights by shareholders of companies - C6-0003/2006 -\nPervenche Ber\u00e8s\n(FR) Before we begin this debate, I should just like to say that I know there are no rules governing the order in which MEPs speak. That being said, I should like to draw the Chamber's attention to a slightly odd situation whereby the rapporteur devoted all of his floor time to answer all of the speakers that had the floor, by way of a conclusion. When the issue at hand is a legislative text, those speaking on behalf of groups do so, according to our well-established practice, in an order commensurate with the political weight of their group and not at the end of the debate.\nIt is for the Commission, which is well represented here, to respond. I am astonished by what has gone on here today. If this is a new, innovative practice, then it should be explained to us.\nPresident\nThe agenda has been drawn up with the agreement of the political groups and we must respect it. These are issues we can look at when we examine our work.\nJoaqu\u00edn Almunia\nMember of the Commission. Madam President, due to the late addition of this item to the agenda, my colleague Mr McCreevy is unable to be here today and I shall present his considerations. I wish to begin by thanking the Committee on Legal Affairs, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and, in particular, the two rapporteurs Mr Lehne and Mr Klinz for their excellent work on this file.\nThe compromise package that is now on the table contains very effective solutions to the problems that we have identified, without imposing excessive burdens. These problems, which led the Commission to submit its proposal, were in principle very simple: at the moment shareholders do not receive information on general meetings i", "\n\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is the debate on the Council and the Commission statements on liberty and security: responding to the threat of terrorism whilst protecting the rights of citizens. \nCharles Clarke,\n\u00a0\u00a0 . Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking you for the opportunity of addressing the European Parliament. I want to take the opportunity to set out the approach that the British Government will follow in its conduct of the Presidency of the Justice and Home Affairs Council, which will be occupied by myself and my colleague Baroness Ashton, who is with me today.\nI start from the proposition that the European Union has been a massive force for good. Thirty-five years ago, when I was a student, we campaigned for democracy in this continent, to remove the fascist or military dictatorships which then existed in Greece, Spain and Portugal, and the totalitarian dictatorships which then ruled much of eastern and central Europe. Those campaigns succeeded as, it is worth pointing out, did the campaigns in other parts of the world, for example Southern Africa and Latin America.\nIn fact, 11 of the 25 current European Union Member States have since emerged to democracy as full members of the European Union. It is a magnificent achievement which we should continue to celebrate.\nOf course the nature of our societies has changed dramatically over these years, economically, socially and technologically. It has changed in the composition of our communities, which vary across the Union, with many communities of differing races, faiths and histories living together.\nBut in all of this I believe that it is our duty to promote a society which is based on the true respect of one individual for another, one culture for another, one faith for another, one race for another.\nIt is our duty to promote the view that democracy, and not violence, is the means of bringing about change and governing ourselves. We have to defend our values of respect, tolerance, freedom and democrac", "12. Emergency autonomous trade preferences for Pakistan (\nPablo Zalba Bidegain\nMadam President, in paragraph 2 of Article 9a, after the words 'at the request of a Member State', we would like to add the phrase 'any legal person or any association not having legal personality acting on behalf of the Union industry'. The reason is to make this regulation consistent with other safeguards that we have approved, such as the South Korea FTA safeguard clause.\nVital Moreira\nChair of the INTA Committee. - Mr President, as Chair of the Committee on International Trade I have a mandate from the committee to ask for the postponement of the vote on the legislative resolution. This is of course irrespective of my personal position in this regard.\nAlgirdas \u0160emeta\nMember of the Commission. - Madam President, the Commission can agree with the proposal to postpone the vote on the legislative resolution.\n", "Ukraine (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on Ukraine.\nBaroness Ashton was not able to remain with us today. Commissioner F\u00fcle will present the matter on her behalf.\n\u0160tefan F\u00fcle\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you for this opportunity and I apologise on behalf of Catherine Ashton, who asked me to share with you what she intended to tell you.\nI am pleased to have this opportunity to make a statement on the current situation in Ukraine. I should like to make my remarks in the light of three important upcoming events: the EU-Ukraine Ministerial meeting which will take place in Luxembourg on 26 October, the local elections which will take place on 31 October, and the 14th EU-Ukraine Summit which will be held in Brussels on 22 November.\nIn recent times, Ukraine has enjoyed a high level of political freedoms. Successive elections have been recognised as having been conducted in accordance with international standards. Ukraine has developed a dynamic and diverse civil society and media environment. There have been consistent improvements across the board with regard to respect for human rights.\nAs a consequence of these developments and of the commitment of successive governments to the path of closer ties with the European Union, relations between the European Union and Ukraine have acquired considerable momentum. This is reflected most clearly in the ambitious and far-reaching European Union-Ukraine Association Agreement which we are currently negotiating, and which aims at achieving the twin goals of political association and economic integration with the European Union.\nPresident Yanukovych's government has undertaken a number of important economic reforms in recent months, which should be commended. These include the adoption of a public procurement law, which should play an important role in the fight against corruption ", "Preparation of European Council (Seville, 21/22 June 2002), including situation between India and Pakistan\nPresident.\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on the preparation of the European Council in Seville on 21 and 22 June 2002, including the situation between India and Pakistan.\n\nde Miguel\nMr President, I shall comment very briefly on the issue raised by Mr Van Orden. This Parliament is well aware that the Council has attended to the issue of Zimbabwe on various occasions and that this matter was addressed at the Barcelona European Council. I have been following the matter very closely and I can tell you that a General Affairs Council will be held next Monday. Let us hope that we can deal with the matter at Minister of Foreign Affairs level and should it prove necessary or appropriate, it could then be raised at the Seville European Council.\nWith regard to the Seville European Council, Mr President, from 21 to 22 June the second and last European Council of the Spanish Presidency of the European Union will take place in Seville. Five basic issues will be addressed at this Council: the process of economic reforms, as a follow-up to the Barcelona European Council; the current state of negotiations on enlargement, a process on which we have made substantial progress; issues of Justice and Home Affairs, in particular immigration policy; the debate on the future of Europe, with a report from the President of the Convention, Mr Giscard d'Estaing; and the issues of greatest concern in the context of the CFSP (Common Foreign and Security Policy).\nI shall now briefly discuss the issues I have mentioned. I shall start with the economic issues - the follow-up to the Spring European Council. This follow-up will be one of the fundamental elements of this forthcoming European Council, since the Spring European Council laid down a programme and a follow-up for certain issues and established a set of tasks to be revised in Seville.\nBarcelona represented the c", "Conclusions of the European Council meeting (17 June 2010) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission: Conclusions of the European Council meeting held on 17 June 2010.\nHerman Van Rompuy\nPresident of the European Council. - Mr President, this was the first meeting of the European Council since I became its President that was not dominated by immediate urgency. It was a normal meeting and the decisions we took were of considerable significance, not least in terms of dealing with the ongoing economic situation and looking beyond the crisis at how we can improve Europe's long-term economic performance.\nWe recently showed strong political determination in safeguarding the stability of the euro. I was happy to note at this meeting a similar resolve to enhance our long-term economic strengths and a commitment to a new European strategy for jobs and growth, including the Europe 2020 strategy. Building on the work of the Commission and of the sectoral councils, we endorsed the five headline targets with which you are now familiar and which we consider to be crucial for increasing Europe's economic growth rate - in itself essential if we are to maintain our European way of life with an ageing population and if we want to remain a world player.\nI know that some in this House and elsewhere have expressed misgivings and asked whether the Europe 2020 strategy can produce better results than the previous Lisbon Strategy, generally held to have been insufficient. My firm belief is that it can.\nWe have deliberately chosen to focus on a smaller number of targets rather than the plethora of targets that got lost in the Lisbon Strategy. They are vital targets and incorporate the social, environmental and educational dimensions that your Parliament has rightly insisted on. We will focus relentlessly on those targets with ongoing work and annual reviews. There will be national breakdowns of targets, and not just Europe-wide aggregates, thereby ", "Welcome\nPresident\nAt the moment, there is a delegation from Serbia in the gallery.

The purpose of the meeting, which was attended by several Vice-Presidents and Quaestors, together with the architects who designed this building, was to discuss how we could improve our working conditions.\nWe discovered during the meeting that the lovely white curtain behind you, Mr President, in fact conceals a huge window which, if the curtain were drawn back, would afford a wonderful view over the river. We were told that the curtain was closed so that you would not have your back to the light and to improve the lighting during debates. But what is to prevent us, before the sitting is opened or when you close the sitting, opening the curtains and enjoying the apparently magnificent view behind you?\nI am more than happy for our House to be illuminated by the brilliance of our debates but a little real sunlight on our bubble of democracy from time to time would not come amiss. I think it would be a nice idea if you could discuss opening this curtain from time to time with the ushers.\n\nPresident\nThank you very much Mr Onesta, I am grateful for any suggestions that will make our Chamber more conducive to human comfort. I would propose that we carry on in the normal way for the time being. In the meantime, I will have someone check as to whether it would be a simple matter, technically speaking. If so, then we will have a trial run for half an hour and see how it looks when the President sits with his back to the light!\n\nUCITS\nPresident\nThe next item is the report (A5-0025/2000) by Mr Olle Schmidt on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on:\nI.

Mr President, I am glad to see you smiling at me - you were a little intemperate in your remarks about me earlier on, but you have obviously calmed down a little over the lunch break.\nCommissioner Oettinger, someone I believe you know well, has said that there would be stress tests - oh, there he is - I did not notice him there. Mr Oettinger, it is nice to see you. Mr Oettinger, a well-schooled disciple of Mrs Merkel, is now also opposed to nuclear power. He was a supporter of atomic energy, but Fukushima has been a road to Damascus for him and, like a latter-day Saul, he, along with several others, has seen a bright light in the sky. At least he has revealed that, in his opinion, there were a couple of nuclear power plants that would not pass the stress tests. I found this very interesting.\nIf you suspect, Mr Oettinger, that there are stress tests that will not produce the desired result because the systems to be tested may not survive the test, then why does the Commission not intervene straight away to close these plants? If the stress tests are anything like what happened with the banks, namely that we realise after the event firstly that the stress tests were not clear enough and secondly that the results did not reflect the actual situation, then the issue of nuclear power would be far more dangerous than the banks.\nMy specific question is therefore: How can it be that you are aware that certain systems will not survive the stress tests and yet do nothing about it?\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso\nPresident of the Commission. - First of all, to know the result of the test we must make the test before. Should any installation fail the test, the question of remedial act", "A sustainable EU policy for the High North (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Gahler, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on a sustainable EU policy for the High North.\nMichael Gahler\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, representatives of our Arctic neighbours who are following this debate, in my capacity as rapporteur, I am particularly pleased to be able to present to you today the result of over a year's work, carried out in cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs, other colleagues in the EU Arctic Forum, and numerous experts and representatives, some of them from the Artic region itself.\nWe have achieved a broad consensus and believe that we have formulated a sustainable policy on the High North. The report analyses the new significance of the Arctic region and describes how the EU's policy in relation to our northern neighbours should be organised from the point of view of the European Parliament. My guiding principle here is the offer of cooperation with the states and institutions of our neighbours in the High North.\nWe are aware of the bilateral and multilateral cooperation already taking place with the Arctic states. Quite apart from the issues relating to the Arctic, Norway and Iceland are already closely involved in the European Economic Area and in cooperation under Schengen. The EU is already an ad hoc observer in the Arctic Council, but I would like to make it clear that I believe it desirable that the EU should be given permanent observer status. This is particularly the case because almost all policy areas of relevance to the region have been brought within the Community sphere in part at least. This offer of cooperation is formulated in this way because we, the EU, cannot take action or initiate any activity in the Arctic in our own right. We are largely dependent on the willingness of the immediately adjacent territories to cooperate with us.\nIn this report, I also focused on the human dimension. In pursu", "Environmental quality standards in the field of water policy (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the report by Anne Laperrouze, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on environmental quality standards in the field of water policy and amending Directive 2000/60/EC C6-0243/2006.\nJoe Borg\nMadam President, I am pleased to open this debate on the proposal on environmental quality standards in the field of water policy, which complements the Water Framework Directive, which is the centrepiece of water protection for the European Union. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Laperrouze, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for its considerable efforts. I would also like to thank the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Fisheries, and in particular the draftsman and draftswomen, Mr R\u00fcbig, Mrs Bourzai and Mrs Corbey respectively, for their very constructive and supportive input on this important file.\nProtecting rivers, lakes, the coastal and marine environment from pollution caused by hazardous substances is a key priority for the Commission. Since the 1970s when the Community took its first decisive action we have made significant progress. However, as we solved some pollution problems, others emerged. The chemical cocktail in our waters has become more complex and the sources of pollution are no longer concentrated at one point but are widespread and diffuse. There has never been a time for complacency.\nTo tackle the pollution problems caused by these dangerous substances the Commission has proposed or adopted more than 30 Community acts since the Water Framework Directive was agreed. I cannot list them all, but let me highlight some as an example.\nFirst, the Commission has banned or restricted the marketing and use of 16 of the p", "3.

I should like to correct it because the meaning has been distorted. It says: \"I am therefore able to tell the House that both Felix Habsburg-Lothringen and Karl Ludwig Habsburg-Lothringen have valid passports without any form of restriction.\" Now comes the mistake: \"Neither signed the declarations of renunciation required by the constitutional office, because they \"have distanced\" themselves from the house of Habsburg\" is what is recorded in the verbatim report of proceedings. It should read \"will never distance\" .\n\nMorgantini\nMadam President, I call upon you, our President, but also upon the Council and the Commission to clarify certain questions, raised by the events of the last few days, with the Turkish government. Firstly, the existence of a blacklist of Members of Parliament and representatives of NGOs whom the Turkish government deems undesirable. Secondly, the arrest, which took place at the very time when a delegation from the European Parliament was visiting Turkey, of Akin Birdal, a human rights campaigner who, apart from anything else, was in a very poor state of health when he was taken back into custody. In addition to this, there has been a marked return to suppression of journalistic activities, which has been documented in a report by other sources as well.\nWe feel that these actions taken by", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\n I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 29 October 1999.\n\nStatement by the President\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, I would like to tell you how shocked I have been, as I know you have, by the tragedy that has taken place in the state of Orissa in eastern India, due to the terrible cyclone which, as you know, has caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people. More than 200,000 houses have been destroyed and more than one and a half million people are now homeless.\nI would simply like to express, on your behalf, and on behalf of the European Parliament, my sincere condolences to the victims' families. If you agree, I shall write to the Indian Prime Minister to send him our condolences.\nFurthermore, we shall be asking the Commission to implement an aid plan to address the most immediate and urgent needs. I was anxious to make this announcement to you.\n\nAdoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting\nPresident\nThe Minutes of Friday 29 October have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nR\u00fcbig\nMadam President, last week Prime Minister Sarkisian and seven other leading politicians were murdered by terrorists in the Armenian Parliament. An expression of sympathy from us would be appropriate.\nIn this context I would like to ask whether our own Security Service and the Belgian authorities are prepared for incidents of this kind.\n\nPresident\nMr R\u00fcbig, that was not at all relevant to the Agenda.\n\nVander Taelen\nMadam President, I would like to make an observation regarding Friday' s voting in Strasbourg. I think the fact that only forty MEPs voted on important issues on Friday has somewhat tarnished Parliament' s image. I am aware that it is not unusual for only a few MEPs to attend certain deliberations, but if voting is involved, then I think that this is extremely detrimental to the image of our Parliament. Forty MEPs voted on important matters. I know that quorum is not an issue - this is in l", "One-minute speeches (Rule 144) \nPresident\nThe next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.\nCzes\u0142aw Adam Siekierski\n(PL) Mr President, for a number of months now, Polish farmers and exporters of farm produce have been unable to export their products to the Russian Federation. In March this year Ukraine became the latest country to ban the import of meat and meat products from Poland. The decision was taken without giving any legal grounds for it. It is surprising that talks between the European Union and the Russian Federation have yielded no results. Perhaps the European Commission does not attach the required importance to matters of trade between Poland and Russia, and gives priority to other interests of the European Union and other countries. For this reason, I again ask the European Commission to do everything it can to have the export ban on Polish agricultural products in Ukraine and Russia lifted. This is a problem that is within the competence of the European Commission, and also within the scope of its responsibility.\nMario Borghezio\n(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a few hours ago an Internet website linked to Al Qaeda declared a holy war through the Internet, inviting all the Muslim hackers of the world to bombard Christian websites, especially the Pope's. This is, in my opinion, an extremely serious matter and an attack on the fundamental principle of religious freedom.\nWhen the freedom to be able to address the world by means of communication is under attack, especially at the highest level, and aim is taken at a religion, indeed at an entire system of belief, one of the basic values of the European Union is under attack: the principle of religious freedom. Europe cannot remain silent about this. We are faced with an escalation of actions and initiatives whose purpose is to strike at the basic principles of our freedom. We must defend ourselves from such arrogance and from such a totalitarian escalation of Islamic fu", "Question Hour with the President of the Commission\nPresident\nThe next item is the Question Hour with the President of the Commission.\nJoseph Daul\nMr President, President Barroso, if my group and most of those present here have worked relentlessly for years in the interests of the Treaty of Lisbon, and if it has come into force - and been in force for more than three months now - it was all done so that Europe could have a policy worthy of the name on the international stage.\nAre we on the right track in this respect? I put this question to you, Mr President. How can we ensure that the voices of 500 million Europeans are heard loud and clear? They have been asking for this for years and it is high time for Europe to assert its ideals and its values at the highest level.\nFinally, the External Action Service provided for by the Treaty of Lisbon should come into being in the coming weeks and months, and this Parliament intends to be closely involved in its creation.\nAs the budgetary authority with the same rights as the Council, the European Parliament will, in any case, have joint decision-making power concerning both the modification of the Staff Regulations of the officials concerned and the financial regulation.\nMr President, my group attaches particular importance to the requirement that this European External Action Service should have full political and budgetary responsibility. I would welcome your opinion on this matter.\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso\nMr Daul, as you know, the creation of the European External Action Service is a very important innovation in the Treaty of Lisbon. This service will play an essential role in supporting the High Representative in her task of ensuring the consistency of our Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). The aim is to strengthen the Union by allowing the Member States to have a greater involvement and increasingly to pool their currently separate efforts in relation to the CFSP. It is therefore not a question of placing European p", "Second Internet Governance Forum, held in Rio de Janeiro from 12 to 15 November 2007 (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by the Commission on the results of the Internet Governance Forum held in Rio de Janeiro last November.\nMeglena Kuneva\nMember of the Commission. - Madam President, the idea of an Internet Governance Forum (IGF) was born at the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis in November 2005 and defined as a non-binding forum for multi-stakeholder policy discussion.\nThe Commission supports the Forum in this form. Two meetings have been held so far: in 2006 in Athens and 2007 in Rio. The Commission welcomes the forum in each form. The Commission also welcomes the participation of Parliament at the forum and is grateful for the excellent cooperation on both meetings.\nAs in the previous year, the meeting in Rio provided an excellent framework for enriching exchanges which allowed the gathering of a range of views on the relevant issues.\nTherefore, the Commission sees value in upholding the main characteristics of the forum, notably the participation of the various stakeholders and its non-binding nature.\nI would like also to thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to say something more concrete on the IGF (we have adopted this abbreviation) which took place in November in Rio de Janeiro.\nFirstly I would like to thank very much Ms Trautmann, Mr Harbour, Mr Badia i Cutchet and Mr H\u00f6kmark, who represented Parliament at this meeting, for their active participation and for the continuation of their excellent cooperation. This allowed us - this year again - together to highlight a number of European priorities such as freedom of speech, bridging the digital divide, security and child protection on-line.\nIt is important for Europe to bring such issues to the forefront of the international agenda on a constant basis. The Commission supports the IGF. This concept, elaborated during the World Summit on the Information Society, is still", "Innovative financing at a global and European level (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item on the agenda is the report by Mrs Podimata, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the report on innovative financing at global and European level.\nAnni Podimata\nMr President, allow me, first of all, to thank the shadow rapporteurs, the secretariat of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the chairs of the political groups for their constructive contribution to the debates and the efforts made to reach agreement on this very important report.\nThe European Parliament own-initiative report on innovative financing could not have come at a better time, because the crisis which, as we all know, is putting everyone to the test, especially the euro area at the moment, has resulted in a severe reduction in public sector resources, extensive austerity programmes and budgetary consolidation in the majority of Member States. At the same time, it has put massive pressure on the EU budget, as we saw very recently in the debate on the new financial framework.\nAs described, this situation has given rise to a basic and commonly accepted conclusion. It is the citizens of Europe who are shouldering most of the weight of the crisis, with pay cuts, with unemployment, with the insecurity surrounding their jobs and with cutbacks in their social rights.\nThe second basic and commonly accepted conclusion to come out of this situation is that Europe and the Member States urgently need new resources which will help to bring about the speedy recovery of and growth in the European economy, this time in a balanced manner that limits inequalities and divergences. This is the only way to create the preconditions to the successful implementation of the EU 2020 strategy and the only way that allows us to discuss a real, proper and strong internal market that will benefit its citizens.\nWe therefore need new resources and we agree, as expressly stated in the report and I quote, ", "Anti-dumping cases - state of play and prospects (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on anti-dumping cases - state of play and prospects by Daniel Caspary, Cristiana Muscardini, Tokia Sa\u00effi, Georgios Papastamkos, Kader Arif, Bernd Lange, Gianluca Susta, Metin Kazak, Niccol\u00f2 Rinaldi, Marielle De Sarnez, Yannick Jadot, Carl Schlyter, Helmut Scholz, Robert Sturdy, Syed Kamall, Jan Zahradil, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left and the European Conservatives and Reformists - B7-0562/2010).\nDaniel Caspary\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, anti-dumping measures play an important role in the world. For us in the European Parliament, and I believe I can speak for the majority of Members here, this is not about protectionism, but about a sensible use of the anti-dumping instrument. We must be able to defend ourselves if other countries distort competition using state subsidies. We must be able to defend ourselves if companies dump products onto the market, in other words, if they sell products at less than the cost of producing them, in order to force their competitors out of the market and to gain an illegitimate advantage.\nI would like to look at one point in particular. I would be interested in answers to the following questions from the Commission. Does the Commission have any experience or any feedback from the Council on the extent to which foreign governments are involved in these activities? Are there cases where governments in whose countries specific companies are based attempt to influence the decisions made in the Committee on Anti-Dumping Practices? Have there been reactions or perhaps even attempts t", "Revision of the Treaties - Transitional measures concerning the composition of the European Parliament - Decision not to convene a Convention for the revision of the Treaties with regard to transitional measures concerning the composition of the European Parliament (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following:\nthe report by Mr M\u00e9ndez de Vigo on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the draft protocol amending Protocol No 36 on transitional provisions concerning the composition of the European Parliament for the rest of the 2009-2014 parliamentary term: the European Parliament's opinion (Article 48(3) of the EU Treaty) [17196/2009 - C7-0001/2010 - 2009/0813(NLE)], and\nthe report by Mr M\u00e9ndez de Vigo on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the recommendation on the European Council's proposal not to convene a Convention for the revision of the Treaties with regard to transitional measures concerning the composition of the European Parliament [17196/2009 - C7-0002/2010 - 2009/0814(NLE)].\n\u00cd\u00f1igo M\u00e9ndez de Vigo\nMr President, please allow me to begin my speech with a line from Rilke: 'Herr, es ist Zeit. Der Sommer war sehr gro\u00df...'. Rilke was the favourite poet of our recently deceased fellow Member, Dimitris Tsatsos. Some time ago now, on 19 November 1997, Dimitris Tsatsos and I had the honour of submitting the report on the Treaty of Amsterdam to this House.\nIt was in that very report on the Treaty of Amsterdam that we proposed that any amendment to Treaties be prepared beforehand by a Convention.\nWe called that the Community method. Indeed, it is that Convention method that was used in preparing the Charter of Fundamental Rights and, above all, the Constitutional Treaty.\nI wish to remember Dimitris Tsatsos today in particular, as we are on the threshold of carrying out the first reform of the Treaty of Lisbon, which, in the last analysis, Mr President, is the Constitutional Treaty for which we fought so hard.\nThat", "27. Crisis of the Equitable Life Assurance Society (vote) \n- Draft European Parliament Recommendation author: Wallis\n- Before the vote\nDiana Wallis \nrapporteur. - Mr President, this is a real report this time. It is a report that represents 18 months of work of a committee of inquiry of this House. This morning whilst we were having the debate, colleagues from various different groups approached me and said that they would like a roll-call vote. We should have requested it yesterday, but in view of the number of colleagues who have come to me, I wonder if we could now do that.\n(The request was accepted)\n", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nCristian Dan Preda\n(RO) I wanted to highlight above all the quality of the efforts made by Gabriele Albertini in drafting the motion. I also wanted to say that I voted in favour of this motion, given that enlargement is an important political gesture for the EU. I also want to point out that I have voted differently from my political group on several issues, basically linked to Kosovo, as I hold a different view to the majority of European countries about Kosovo. Therefore, I voted differently on Amendment 17 in Article 19, Amendment 22, Amendment 24 and also after citation 4 in point 10.\nI still regard enlargement as being very important, but I also believe that the differences expressed by five of the Member States must be taken into account.\nMar\u00eda Mu\u00f1iz De Urquiza\n(ES) Madam President, the votes of the Spanish socialist delegation on Kosovo support international non-recognition of Kosovo's unilateral declaration as an independent State.\nDimitar Stoyanov\n(BG) I voted against the enlargement strategy resolution because it contains many flattering words about the progress Turkey is making under the Copenhagen criteria. I do not see any sign of this progress. Fellow Members, please understand once and for all that Turkey is a country which, less than 100 years ago, committed genocide against the peoples within its borders and peoples which had recently liberated themselves from Turkish rule. Today, Turkey still continues to commit genocide, and its population and political class are proud of these actions committed by their country. Twenty years ago, Turkey sponsored terrorist organisations and exported terrorism. It continues to foster close links with terrorist organisations even to this day. If we want to have a country in the European Union which is still proud of genocide and sponsors terrorism, then go ahead and accept it. However, I am definitely against this.\nHannu Takkula\n(FI) Mr President, I voted in favour of ", "Preparing forests for climate change (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Kriton Arsenis, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Commission Green Paper on forest protection and information in the EU: preparing forests for climate change.\nKriton Arsenis\nMadam President, Commissioner, forests are very important to us all, for everyone here in this House and for every European in every corner of Europe. Forests are a part of our identity. We use them for recreation and for employment, and yet forests are so different for each of us, in each area of Europe. If someone from northern Europe visits the Mediterranean forests, he will think that many areas that we in the Mediterranean call forests are savannahs or parks, as they support no productive activities. Or, conversely, someone from the Mediterranean travelling in northern Europe will consider that the forests in the area are man-made rather than natural, as they support heavy productive activities.\nThese forests, which are so different for each individual in Europe, for each area, face a common threat: climate change. Climate change is threatening European forests, with an increase in forest fires, with diseases passing from one country to another and putting entire species at risk, and with disasters caused by extreme weather conditions. The impact differs from one geographical area to another, but it is a cross-border impact and needs to be addressed with Europe's assistance.\nToday, we are debating, and in two days, we shall vote on Parliament's report on forest protection. This report was shaped by consent, right from the start, in cooperation with members from every country and political group. When it was tabled for debate in committee, it was further shaped by a procedure of 50 compromise amendments, from all the political groups and areas represented in Europe. I am therefore certain that this report represents Parliament's opinion as to ", "Membership of political groups: see Minutes\n\nNicolae Vlad Popa\nMr President, I want to thank all colleagues for supporting the written declaration on fibromyalgia. It is the most beautiful Christmas present we can give to millions of fibromyalgia patients. Thank you all.\n(Applause)\n", "11. Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: progress report 2008 (vote) \n- Before the vote:\nErik Meijer\nauthor. - Mr President, before we vote on the resolution I tabled on the accession process for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, I wish to make three technical remarks so that everybody can decide on the correct texts.\nFirst remark: where it speaks about the Macedonian negotiator in paragraph 12, the text should be 'the negotiator of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia'. This is entirely in line with what we decided on when voting on my reports of 2007 and 2008.\nSecond remark: in paragraph 18, the Macedonian Orthodox Church is the official name of the biggest religious community in the country. This is mentioned in order to distinguish it from the Serbian Orthodox group. This use of the word 'Macedonian' cannot be replaced by any reference to any state name. As it is the official name of an institution, I propose surrounding the name with inverted commas.\nThird remark: as regards the translation of the word 'pending' in paragraph 10 in the phrase 'pending full implementation of the key priorities of the Accession Partnership', the French and Italian versions - at least - differ from the texts in English, German and Dutch. For all final translations I propose using the original English version.\nGiorgos Dimitrakopoulos\non behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (EL) Mr President, in paragraph 12 we had Amendment 1 by Mr Swoboda, on which a roll-call vote was requested and, as you know, Mr Swoboda withdrew Amendment 1 today. I would therefore ask that a roll-call vote be taken on the second part of paragraph 12.\nAnna Ibrisagic\non behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I should like to propose a deletion of one part of the text, so the new text of the second part of paragraph 13 should read: 'in view of the new round of negotiations announced under the \"Nimetz process\u201d, expresses the hope that all governments in the neighbourhood will support the integration ", "Statement by the President\nPresident\nBefore starting on the agenda, it is with a heavy heart that I have to remind you that the terrorist organisation, ETA has broken the ceasefire it had declared last March. Its barbarous attack on Madrid airport has caused the deaths of two Ecuadoreans, Carlos Alonso Palate and Diego Armando Estacio, who, as immigrants, had found their place in Spanish society and so were able to support their families in Ecuador.\nWith this attack, ETA has put an end to the process that was initiated by the Spanish Government and that was debated in October 2006.\nI should like, on behalf of the European Parliament, to express our most sincere sympathy and condolences to the families and friends of the two men who were murdered and to all Spaniards and Ecuadoreans.\nI also want firmly to reiterate in this House the condemnation of this savage act of terrorism and to make it absolutely clear that, in a democracy, violence is wholly incompatible with dialogue and that peace,\n(Applause)\ncoexistence in freedom and respect for human rights are non-negotiable.\nI also want to reiterate our support for all of Spain's democratic institutions in that country's fight against ETA terrorism and to express the hope of all the European democracies that, sooner rather than later, Spaniards will put an end to violence throughout Spain.\nI am going to ask you to observe a minute's silence for Carlos Alonso Palate and Diego Armando Estacio.\n(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)\n", "Presentation by the Council of the draft general budget for the 2010 financial year (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the presentation by the Council of the draft general budget for the 2010 financial year.\nHans Lindblad\nMr President, it is a tremendous privilege for me to be here today. It makes me feel very humble and I am delighted to have the chance to present the Council's draft general budget to you.\nEurope is facing considerable challenges. The economic situation looked significantly more worrying six months ago, but it seems to have stabilised. The risk scenario is more balanced and the risk of being drawn deeper into a downward spiral has reduced.\nHowever, we face significant problems in the form of rising unemployment, growing budgetary deficits and increasing debt. In the light of this, there is a great need to maintain public finances that are sustainable in the long term. Many countries have a long way to go to balance their public finances.\nDemographics will exert huge pressure on public finances. The challenges we face with regard to the climate will require new resources and the redistribution of existing resources. Overall, this means, in our opinion, that the budget that we are to agree on should reflect a high degree of restraint in order to leave room for future needs, with the emphasis on European added value and investments which, in the short term, can bring us out of the economic crisis and, in the long term, can also strengthen our competitiveness.\nThe Council's draft, which was adopted unanimously, deals with and contributes to meeting these challenges. It is a disciplined budget and a sound one from the point of view of state finances. It will promote research, education, competitiveness, innovation and the building of infrastructures, and it will promote cohesion. The Council's draft also contains margins for coping with unforeseen events.\nThe logic behind our draft general budget is quite simple. If we want to stimulate growth, employ", "State of the negotiations on the climate change and energy package (continuation of debate) \nPresident\nWe shall resume the debate on the state of the negotiations on the climate change and energy package.\n\nStruan Stevenson\nMadam President, on a point of order, I should like to inform the Members of this House that this morning the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg ordered that the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran should be taken off the EU terror list. This is the third time this ruling has been made and this should be a warning to the Council and the Commission that their attempts to appease the mullahs and the oppressive regime in Tehran by putting the PMOI on the EU terror list constitute an offence against freedom and liberty.\n(Applause)\n\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, if you do not mind, we shall therefore resume the order of speaking time.\nHerbert Reul\n(DE) Madam President, Presidency of the Council and Commission, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament has in recent years always been very bold in exercising its own rights. We have not let ourselves be swayed either when we invited the Dalai Lama, or when we took a decision regarding the Sakharov prize, or with regard to participation in the Olympics.\nI am therefore very concerned that we are not exercising our rights sufficiently regarding such an important matter, which evidently only generates limited interest today and which some fellow Members have described as the question of the century. I would ask the Presidency of the Council and the Parliamentary Leadership to ensure that we not only talk of better regulation, but that we actually also have the opportunity to see and examine texts. At the moment, for example, in the case of emissions trading, talks are based not on Parliament's opinion but only on the decision of a single committee. There have been four committees which have made decisions, the assumptions of which have not been brought into the trialogue. One rapporteur negotiates, and 7", "Statements by the President\nPresident\nLast week, in the Turkish town of Malatya, three people working for Zirve, a Christian publishing house, were murdered in a particularly cruel manner. This was a dreadful deed, one that I condemn in the strongest terms, and I would encourage the Turkish authorities to continue in their efforts to shed light on every aspect of this crime. The Turkish Government has strongly denounced these attacks, and I would urge them most emphatically to bring those responsible to account for their actions. The protection of religious minorities and of their rights is an important function of the rule of law in any democratic state, and this House condemns all crimes committed by political or religious fanatics against those whose opinions and convictions differ from their own.\nI have to inform the House that the news has just reached us of the death of Boris Yeltsin, the former - and first - President of Russia. We wish to express our sympathies to the Russian people.\n", "1. Zimbabwe\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Zimbabwe.\nMarios Matsakis\nauthor. - Madam President, the political, economic and humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe is going from bad to worse, with the threat of a generalised outbreak of cholera and other potential epidemics adding to the already dire conditions in which the Zimbabwean people find themselves.\nIt is now absolutely clear that Mr Mugabe cares very little about the well-being of his countrymen. He cares much more about living a life of personal luxury and extravagance. Mr Mugabe has proved beyond any reasonable doubt that he is totally unfit to govern his country in the modern world. He finds excuses for his political existence by pretending to fight the ghosts of the long bygone British colonial era.\nThere is no way we Europeans can convince Mr Mugabe to see reason. The only chance to force him to step down is a drastic change in the stance held by the African Union. It is shameful that this organisation has not intervened in a much more decisive and resolute manner already. I believe that our efforts must be directed at the African Union and the governments of the nations it consists of. We must make it absolutely clear to them that we hold them wholly responsible for the sorry state of affairs in Zimbabwe and expect them, even at this very late stage, to take proper drastic action to get Mr Mugabe's regime to step down and go home or face severe consequences, not excluding trial for crimes against humanity.\nCatherine Stihler\nauthor. - Madam President, if colleagues could think for a moment about their worst nightmare, it would not even come close to what is happening to the people of Zimbabwe. Once a prosperous country, it has been turned on its head by its President. The country is collapsing - no governance, no jobs, hyperinflation, no food, no health service - and the breakdown of the sanitation system is now creating a cholera outbreak.\nA week ago, Zimbabwean Pr", "Transitional procedural guidelines on budgetary matters in view of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report (\u03917-0045/2009) by Mr Lamassoure, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on transitional procedural guidelines on budgetary matters in view of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty [2009/2168(\u0399\u039d\u0399)].\nAlain Lamassoure\nMr President, first of all, I should like to take this opportunity to thank President Barroso and Commissioner \u0160emeta for their decision to postpone the publication of the Commission's proposals on the future budgetary policy and on the updating of the financial perspective until the next six-month term.\nAdmittedly, the European Council and Parliament had agreed that this update would take place in 2008-2009, but that was four years ago, which is an eternity. In the meantime, there has been the Treaty of Lisbon, the first Irish referendum, the financial crisis, the delay in the entry into force of the new treaty, and so on.\nIt is therefore wiser to entrust the new Commission with the task of presenting its political programme and the financial translation of that programme together in a few months' time.\nOn the other hand, as the Treaty of Lisbon is due to come into force on 1 December, we must waste no time in adopting the transitional measures necessary to go from one treaty to another in the budgetary field.\nThe Swedish Presidency has proposed that the conciliation committee of 18 November be an opportunity for the three institutions to reach a political agreement on this subject. It is therefore now a question of Parliament giving a negotiating mandate to its delegation at the conciliation committee.\nFour points must be dealt with as soon as possible; none should present a serious political problem.\nFirstly, the transfer procedure: abolishing the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenses requires the adoption of a single procedure, putting the two budgetary authorities on an e", "Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed. Are there any comments?\n\nR\u00fcbig\nMr President, I would like it noted as a matter of urgency that the case of Dr. Ganzert, an attorney from Wels, has been dismissed. He is at present being held without good cause by the authorities in Nicaragua and has for three weeks been endeavouring to get permission to leave the country. I wish, though, to thank you, Madam President, for writing to the authorities in Nicaragua and asking for him to be given an exit visa.\n\nPresident\nI will raise that matter with the President.\n(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved) President. I should like to inform the House that the Minister of Justice for Belgium, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Verwilghen, cannot be present at the beginning of this debate because of fog in Brussels. We are expecting him to arrive at some stage. I suggest to the House that we will have to continue the debate and our agenda therefore. We look forward to the Minister's arrival.\n  \n\nTerr\u00f3n i Cus\u00ed\nMr President, I would like you to take note of my strong protest at the conditions under which this debate is to be held. I am not referring to the absence of the Minister, although this is also a problem, but to the systematic manner in which the Conference of Presidents organises debates relating to the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, amalgamating every topic into a joint debate. It seems to me to show a total lack of respect that, at the same time and for the same duration as a debate of such great importance as that on annual progress in the field of Justice and Home Affairs, we should also be debating the Hazan report on the Council report on justice and home affairs: EU priorities and policy objectives for external relations and the Watson report on a recommendation to the Council on an area of Freedom, Security and Justice: security at meetin", "Question Time (Commission) \nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B7-0462/2010).\nThe following questions are addressed to the Commission.\nPart one\n\nSubject: Further EU action on combating violence against women\nThe Stockholm Programme adopted by Parliament in 2009 and the European Parliament resolution on the elimination of violence against women call on the Commission to take additional measures to combat violence against women, paying particular attention to prevention and raising public awareness. The Commission is called on to present a study and the findings of research in this area and to start work on drafting a new directive on combating violence against women.\nWhen can the findings of this study and of the research be expected, and what are the Commission's immediate plans as regards the drafting of a new directive?\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Andor\nMember of the Commission. - Violence against women constitutes a violation of fundamental rights, and the Commission reaffirms its commitment to ensuring that respect for fundamental rights is at the core of our activities.\nViolence against women cannot be justified on the grounds of customs, tradition or religious considerations. The Commission confirms its strong commitment to combating violence against women. This is reflected in the Commission's communication of April 2010 on the Stockholm Programme, which puts emphasis on the protection of victims of crime, including female victims of violence and genital mutilation.\nRespecting the commitments of our action plan implementing the Stockholm Programme, the Commission is currently working on its strategy to combat violence against women. In the first half of 2011, the Commission intends to adopt a strategy to combat violence against women. Prevention and awareness-raising activities will be a key point in the Commission's strategy.\nLast March, the Commission strengthened its commitment to promoting gender equality and fighting violence against women by presenting a Women's Char", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of Thursday 2 April have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nWijsenbeek\nMr President, this concerns item 4 of yesterday's Minutes and Article 24 of the Rules of Procedure, on the duties of the Conference of Presidents. Paragraph 5 says: \"The Conference of Presidents shall draw up the draft agenda of Parliament's part-sessions' . In other words, the Conference of Presidents decides which reports will be on the agenda, and when. It does not say that the group chairmen decide whether a report is acceptable to them or not. This means that the Conference of Presidents should not judge the reports appearing on the agenda on their contents. This was the case with my report on the partsession which was discussed this week, and it was especially the case with your own report on the voting system. I really wonder, therefore, whether the Conference of Presidents is in fact blatantly and grossly violating the Rules of Procedure.\n\nPresident\nMr Wijsenbeek, you have been chairman of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities for some time now, and you are one of the many people in this Chamber who have a great deal of parliamentary experience. You know, as indeed we all do - I do not claim any privilege to this knowledge - that, in the final analysis, the Conference of Presidents is elected by Parliament. When changes are to be made to the agenda, the final word is always left to Parliament, which also votes. Therefore, you need never worry that there is an elected organ of the House which was not elected by the House.\n\nHerman\nMr President, this is the text relating to the Randzio-Plath report.\nYesterday, it was agreed during the vote that the words 'responsabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9mocratique' would be used instead of 'contr\u00f4le d\u00e9mocratique' . That change has been made in one of the titles, but not throughout the whole text. For example, paragraph 8 still says \"contr\u00f4le d\u00e9mocratique' . The words \"co", "4.

As President, I appeal to the perpetrators to immediately release Mrs Ingrid Betancourt, the five other parliamentarians being held hostage and the 40 civilians who have been kidnapped in the recent past and are still being held in illegal captivity. Furthermore, I remind the kidnappers that it is especially inhuman to hold hostages who are in a precarious state of health and that these should be released immediately on humanitarian grounds.\nMembers will recall our strong support following the statement to plenary by President Pastrana on Tuesday, 26 October 1999 for the peace process in Colombia expressing numerous resolutions on 'Plan Colombia' . The European Parliament regrets all the more the breakdown in the peace process negotiations and the recent resumption of hostilities and calls on the parties concerned to resume their search for a democratic and negotiated settlement for peace in Colombia.\nParliament expresses its solidarity with the families of the hostages and with the people of Colombia.\n\nCohn-Bendit\nMr President, thank you for that statement.

I want to register my protest at the lack of facilities for me, as a Deputy within this Chamber. Two and a half years ago, I went to the authorities who were dealing with the building of this new structure and informed them of my requirements as a person with a disability within the Chamber. I was assured at that stage that every facility would be made available. I arrived here last month and spoke with the architects and builders with regard to the seating arrangements within the hemicycle. I also wrote a letter to the former President, informing him of the difficulties that would arise.\nI arrived here today, after being re-elected to this Parliament, to discover, firstly, that I cannot get from the '0' level of the building to the first level without getting a security card from one of the security services. I was delayed for 24 minutes this morning and 38 minutes last night waiting for someone to come along with a card.\nSecondly, I cannot sit with my political group within this House because there are no facilities for me to sit with them. Thirdly, it is an absolute disgrace when so much public money has been spent on this new building that we could not give a proper example for the 21st century - for the new millennium - of what kind of an inclusive society the European Parliament wants to see in the future.\nLoud and sustained applause\nI should like to finish with a quote from George Bernard Shaw: 'To hate your fellow man is not the ultimate sin bu", "1. 2008 discharge: European Police College (\nV\u00e9ronique Mathieu\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, following on from the unanimous vote in the Committee on Budgetary Control, the decision to refuse to grant discharge that has been submitted to you today is vitally important for our institution.\nFirstly, I am keen to remind you of the professionalism and the efforts made by the other regulatory agencies to comply with standards of good administration. These efforts should not be tainted by the bad example set by the European Police College (CEPOL). That is why Parliament must assume its responsibilities as a discharge authority and refuse to grant CEPOL discharge for the financial year 2008 in the circumstances of which we are aware.\nThus, Parliament cannot accept the serious managerial failings of the former director, and, what is more, it cannot condone the fact that the management board has not assumed its responsibilities by adopting the necessary measures.\nFinally, given that the College has been experiencing major difficulties since 2006 and that progress will not be seen until 2014, it is no longer acceptable for the College to need at least nine years to reach an adequate level of good administration.\nTo conclude, I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their work on this matter.\n", "6. Presentation of the Commission work programme for 2011 (\n- Before the vote on Amendment 7:\nDoris Pack\n(DE) Mr President, I would like the end of this amendment to be reworded.

The wording does not express this clearly enough, so we would like to insert the following text:\nThe current stalemate of the Union for the Mediterranean.\n(DE) I know that there is a contradiction here. Perhaps another wording would be possible, but the wording we are proposing is:\nThe current stalemate of the Union for the Mediterranean.\n", "\n(1) \nAhern, Nuala (Verts/ALE ).\n\u00a0\u00a0  Mr President, as other colleagues have done this week, I too would like to draw the attention of the House to the unusual fact that we were not allowed to make one-minute speeches on Monday. I submitted a statement in writing at that time on the issue of Mordechai Vanunu, who was released from jail in Israel yesterday after 18 years' imprisonment.\nHe is subject to very severe, cruel and unusual restrictions on his liberty. This is not acceptable in a democracy. He is not allowed to leave the country, people watch him wherever he goes, he is not allowed to make contact with foreigners and he is not allowed to contact journalists. I ask the President to make representations to the Israeli Parliament and Government in support of this person, who served a prison sentence for showing that weapons of mass destruction were being prepared in Israel. These are precisely what the forces in Iraq have been seeking; the discrepancy between the way the two countries are treated is simply amazing.\nI ask you, Mr President, to bring this matter to the attention of the President of Parliament, and to ask him to contact the Israeli authorities with a view to allowing this man his liberty. He has served his sentence. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 We shall bear this in mind. I shall pass this request on to the President. Without doubt this is an issue which arouses strong emotions amongst many European citizens of all political persuasions, and I have no doubt that in the future it will be dealt with in Parliament through the appropriate channels. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is the Commission statement on the outcome of the trial against Leyla Zanay and others in Ankara. \nNielson,\n\u00a0\u00a0 .

Situation in Bangladesh\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the situation in Bangladesh.\nEwa Tomaszewska\nauthor. - (PL) Mr President, in connection with the disturbances in January 2007, the caretaker government in Bangladesh introduced a state of emergency, and on 11 June this year it passed a new regulation limiting human rights through an imprecise definition of a terrorist act.\nIn June there was a mass wave of arrests in Bangladesh, taking advantage of extraordinary powers enabling arrests to be made without a warrant when a link between the person being arrested and criminal offences can be presumed. In fact, the arrests concerned leaders, members and sympathisers of the two main opposition groups, the Awami League and the Bangladesh People's Party, who were refusing to cooperate with the government in organising general elections until their leaders were released from captivity. Today's incipient negotiations with the Awami League are cause for hope. The massive rise in food prices is threatening the stability of the country, however. Under these conditions, the elections planned for December are no guarantee that Bangladesh is setting off down the road of democracy.\nWe call on the Government of Bangladesh to lift the state of emergency and respect human rights, which will help to maintain democratic standards during the course of the elections. We call for the armed forces to be withdrawn from actions linked to the organisation of the elections.\nJean Lambert\nauthor. - Mr President, as we know, Parliament has been concerned about the situation in Bangladesh for a considerable period of time. We supported calls for moves to ensure free and fair elections and we also supported the calls from civil society for revised and updated electoral registers to ensure that maximum participation would be possible within those elections.\nI think it is important to say that we very much welcome the progress that has been made on that ne", "Developments in the ongoing debt crisis and the EU response (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on developments in the ongoing debt crisis and the EU response.\nAndr\u00e1s K\u00e1rm\u00e1n\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I fully understand the significant interest in this Parliament in the actions being undertaken within the Union and beyond to tackle the challenges which some Member States are facing in relation to their public finances.\nThe global financial crisis has had a significant impact on both revenues and expenditure in all our countries, even if the extent and nature of that impact is not the same in all cases and the capacity of individual Member States to handle the consequences is also very different.\nThe first thing I would like to stress is that it is the Member States themselves which are, first and foremost, responsible for ensuring that their public finances are sustainable and on a sound footing. Similarly, it is for each one of them to ensure that their economies are competitive, flexible and resilient. Of course, that does not mean that public finances and economic performance are not also a matter of collective interest.\nWe are part of a Union, and our economies are interlinked in a number of ways: through the single market and, in many cases, through the sharing of the common currency and the deeper economic integration which that implies. More generally, we all have a commitment of solidarity towards each other, based on a desire to protect and promote the wider European interest. What that means is that we all want to see a stable and strong economy across the EU as a whole and, within it, of the euro area in particular. Where necessary, this has to involve taking steps to ensure the stability of individual Member States.\nWe have a number of tools at our disposal to do this. We have the coordination mechanism that seeks to ensure that appropriate economic and budgetary policies are pursued by each", "2. The institutional aspects of the European Union's capacity to integrate new Member States (vote) \n- Before the vote on Amendment 8:\nAlexander Stubb \nrapporteur. - Mr President, on Amendment 8 which has been tabled by the PSE Group, the version we will follow is the French original language version which refers to the 'Lisbon Strategy'. The English version talks about the 'social model', and of course the PSE Group did not mean that.\n(The oral amendment was adopted)\nPresident\nThat concludes the vote.\n", "1. Statistics on migration and international protection (vote) \n- Before the vote:\nEwa Klamt \nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ever since 1999, this House has been debating legislative proposals relating to migration without any figures on which to base its decisions, while the scope of immigration policy has become considerably wider. What we need, then, is more and better information if we are to be able to effectively plan, implement, evaluate and monitor political measures. Led by Commissioner Frattini, the Commission has responded to pressure from this House and has submitted a draft regulation on the statistical monitoring of migratory movements, something that is made necessary by the Member States' failure to supply all the relevant statistical material, or indeed any at all, on the previously voluntary basis.\nData are also collected in different ways, with the consequence that they have, hitherto, not been comparable. This regulation obliges our Member States to provide any and all figures that may be required; it also brings about harmonisation and makes it possible to compare the figures. It was relatively difficult to get the Council to come round to this, whilst all the parties in this House agreed in principle on the need for the regulation.\nThe general agreement prevailing among the groups meant that this House was able to get its position accepted through the comitology procedure, and the outstanding cooperation of all the shadow rapporteurs, to whom I would like to take this opportunity of expressing my thanks, played a considerable part in enabling us to bring this dossier to a satisfactory conclusion, so thank you all, once more, for that.\nGeoffrey Van Orden\nMr President, I beg the indulgence of the House. I wish to draw the attention of the House to the appalling situation in Zimbabwe. We look with horror and enormous frustration at the images of how a peaceful assembly is brutally dealt with in Mugabe's country. I understan", "Complaint by Boeing (US) against Airbus (EU) before the WTO (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the complaint by Boeing (US) against Airbus (EU) before the WTO.\nLouis Michel\nMember of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is important to remember that you invited the Commission here today to discuss the dispute between the United States and the European Union on the support provided by the governments concerned for Airbus and Boeing.\nMuch ink has been spilled over these matters so let us start by recalling the key facts. What is at issue? The US Government claims that money that the European governments have invested in Airbus infringe WTO rules on subsidies. In October 2004 the United States, unilaterally and without prior notice, withdrew from a bilateral agreement signed with the European Union in 1992, which explicitly authorised this type of investment, and the US decided to being a case in the WTO.\nThe European Union noted that the United States preferred litigation over negotiation and for its part asked the WTO to declare illegal the US subsidies granted to Boeing. Where are we now, three years later? Despite several attempts in the last few years to resolve the dispute amicably, the parties' differences have prevented this from happening.\nThe United States has denied giving subsidies to Boeing, and has said that prior to any negotiations the European Union would as a precondition have to stop giving Airbus the support previously provided under the system of repayable loans.\nYou will appreciate that under these conditions it is impossible to establish a fair and balanced basis for a negotiated settlement. A few weeks ago Boeing publically rejected the latest olive branch, if I can call it that, proffered by Airbus. That was on 18 October.\nWe are therefore sceptical whether this dispute can be resolved at the negotiating table any time soon. This means that we will continue to defend in the WTO European ", "Statement by the President\nPresident. -\nBefore turning to the topic of this morning's debate I should like to make a brief statement in the presence of the President-in-Office of the Council on the grave developments in the Middle East over the past several days.\nWe have been watching with growing disbelief the violence and reciprocal atrocities that have plumbed new depths of horror in recent days. Military operations have now reached levels unknown in two decades. The region, and especially Israel and the Palestinian Territories, seem to be edging frighteningly and inexorably towards an all-out conflagration.\nWe have a responsibility in our Parliament in this unfolding tragedy to do anything that we can to prevent the holy places being transformed into killing fields. We must actively support the unanimous call yesterday evening by the United Nations Security Council for an immediate ceasefire. The EU's High Representative knows that our Parliament stands squarely behind him in his efforts in favour of peace and for a ceasefire.\nEqually, I would like to take this opportunity this morning to place on the public record our Parliament's deep debt to the personal courage and unshakeable commitment of the European Union envoy, Mr Moratinos. He may not thank me for saying this, but I had the opportunity to speak to him at length yesterday about his diplomatic efforts on our behalf to keep channels of communication open with all sides. He is, for Europe, one of our unsung heroes.\n\nI want to pledge to this House to take any action on behalf of Parliament which has a chance of promoting peace and of trying to draw this region back from the edge. I have taken steps to invite Mr Shimon Peres and Yasser Arafat to seek to break that infernal cycle of violence by inviting them to come to address this House. I hope they will be in a position to take up this offer. We would welcome them as champions of peace through the hardest of times.\nI, in cooperation with Mr Solana and the g", "8. Combating racism and xenophobia (vote) \n- Report: Martine Roure\n- Before the vote\nMartine Roure\n(FR) Mr President, I would just like to say that the European Parliament has once again demonstrated its maturity and sense of responsibility, and I would point out to the Council, which is not here, that it should follow our example: we have produced a text which has the unanimous approval of practically the whole of our committee, and this is something we can be proud of. My thanks go to all my fellow committee members.\n", "One-minute speeches on matters of political importance\nPresident\nThe next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.\nJ\u00f6rg Leichtfried\n(DE) Mr President, I do not know whether what I am going to say still relates to the agenda, but I think that this is the most appropriate time to mention it. One of the consequences of the Treaty of Lisbon is, of course, that the number of MEPs will change, and for Austria this means that two new Members will be joining this House. These Members are ready, they have been elected and it is important that they come here soon.\nI would like to ask you what steps have already been taken to enable these Members to take their places here quickly, either as observers or as full Members, or what you intend to do to make this happen quickly.\nPresident\nThe first step in this matter should be taken by the European Council. I spoke in the European Council last Thursday and said clearly that it is extremely important for Parliament that the Council take the initial legal steps to enable us to accept the additional Members and to know from which countries they will come. This must be done in accordance with the principles of law, and that step should now be taken by the Council. I am continually appealing for the Council to take the appropriate steps. The next steps, after an initial decision from the Council, should then be taken by Parliament.\nCarlos Jos\u00e9 Iturgaiz Angulo\n(ES) Mr President, I would like to condemn in this House the continual provocations, abuses of power and threats by the President of Venezuela, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. With his dictatorial method of government he is threatening, among other things, freedom of expression in Venezuela and democratic order in Latin America.\nPresident Ch\u00e1vez has closed down thirty radio stations and some television channels. He is threatening and punishing journalists in Venezuela because they do not support his autocratic regime.\nBecause of all this, Mr President, it should also be poi", "Implementation of the first railway package directives (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Brian Simpson, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the implementation of the first railway package (Directives 2001/12/EC, 2001/13/EC and 2001/14/EC) - B7-0204/2010)\nBrian Simpson\nauthor. - Mr President, I do not think I will pull my punches here tonight in regard to this particular oral question on the implementation of the first railway package. You will be aware, Commissioner, that the three directives that make up the first railway package were adopted in 2001, with a deadline of March 2006 for their transposition into national law. It is my obligation, as Chair of the Transport Committee, to raise this issue with you now by way of this oral question.\nHere we are, nine years later, debating the fact that 21 Member States had, by October 2009, failed to enact these directives and have now been sent reasoned opinions because of this failure. It beggars belief that, as we approach the revision of the first railway package, a number of states - including so-called influential states, including states that like to inform us of their pro-European credentials - have failed to enact this significant piece of European legislation. Those Member States should hang their heads in shame and remember and honour the obligations they gave to this Parliament in 2001.\nIt is one of politics' most bewildering facts that we can deliver throughout the European Union the single market in numerous areas, but we cannot deliver it in the railway sector. That is not a failure of this Parliament. That is a failure of the Member States, often supported by sections of the railway industry and, frankly, Parliament's patience is beginning to run out.\nThis oral question is born out of a frustration, a frustration that the law is being deliberately flouted and that as yet, the Commission has failed to bring Member States to book. We ", "\nWatson\nMr President, colleagues will have read in some of this morning's newspapers about the refusal of the Republic of France to recognise the extraterritorial status of the European Parliament. Apparently, the French government has refused to issue a visa to the President of the Republic of China to allow him to come to Parliament for a meeting. This is a denial of our status as a supranational Parliament, and I hope that you will be protesting to the French government about the fact that Mr Chen has not been allowed a visa. . .\n- . . . and insisting that we, in the European Union, should be recognising a country which has existed as a flourishing parliamentary democracy for some 14 years and the status it must have in a world in which democracies must work together.\n(Applause)\n\nPresident\n I have taken note of what you have said. The President will, of course, be duly informed.\n\nDecision on urgent procedure\n[COM(2001) 551 - C5-0477/2001 - 2001/0223(CNS)]\n\nLagendijk (Verts/ALE). (NL) Mr President, this matter was discussed last week in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. We do not think it is a good idea to approve the request for urgent debate for a variety of reasons: it appears to be a technical matter, but in our view, it is an entirely political decision which requires thorough preparation in this Parliament.\nTwo issues are involved. First of all, the future of EU aid in the Balkans. Will this now be provided via an agency or via delegations? There is a great deal of confusion about this. That is why the Commission has asked the Commissioner responsible, Mr Patten, to visit the committee next week and to discuss this matter with the committee.\nSecondly, this proposal has caused quite a bit of unrest in Macedonia. It seems appropriate to us to take the time to discuss this matter further with the Macedonian authorities before the Council takes a decision.\nFinally, the committee is able to approve a report as soo", "Set aside for year 2008 (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the proposal for a Council regulation, under examination by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, derogating from Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers, as regards set aside for year 2008 - C6-0302/2007 -.\nMariann Fischer Boel\nMember of the Commission. - Madam President, I can tell you that the cereal market outlook is clearly at the forefront of our minds, as we are in a situation where the prices have shown unprecedented growth in the recent months. This is not only the case within the European Union but all over the world.\nWith too much rain in certain parts of Europe and with droughts in other parts of Europe, the climatic conditions within our own regions this year have been adverse to cereal production and, with an estimated output of 258 million tonnes, the 2007 harvest is below average. A compulsory set-aside of the present 10% in the old Member States, the EU-15, is not compatible with the present market situation. Against this background, the Commission has proposed to set 0% on set-aside for the autumn 2007 harvest and the sowing in spring 2008. According to our estimates, this will mean extra production within the European Union of between 10 and 17 million tonnes, and I think this will send a positive signal to the sector and, hopefully, also contribute to stabilisation within the grain sector.\nA rapid decision on this matter is clearly needed so that farmers can decide their next production year and, in this context, I am actually very thankful for the fact that Parliament obviously understood the urgency of the matter and agreed to follow the fast-track procedure. I really am very grateful.\nFinally, our legal proposal will be as short and as simple as possible and it will not imply any new administrative burdens.\nLooking further ahead, it is nece", "Composition of committees and delegations\nPresident\nI have received a motion from the Independence and Democracy Group to appoint Mr Farage to replace Mr Colman as a member of the Committee on International Trade. Are there any objections to this?\nHannes Swoboda\n(DE) Mr President, is there a minimum period for serving on a committee, or is this just intended for today?\nPresident\nYou would need to put that question to the Independence and Democracy Group, of course, but I can assure you that the President of Parliament will support absolute transparency in this matter.\nNigel Farage\nMr President, just to reassure my Austrian colleague, I was in fact a member of the Committee on International Trade for the first two and a half years of this parliamentary term. I then gave way to a colleague who retired from Parliament completely two weeks ago. So, contrary to what you may fear, this is not just a last-minute put-up job.\nPresident\nYou have not answered the question as to how long you intend to serve on this committee, but I would infer from your remarks that you will continue to do so until the end of this parliamentary term.\n", "9. International carriage of passengers by coach and bus (recast) (\n- Before the vote:\nHannes Swoboda\n(DE) Mr President, I just wanted to thank Mr Grosch and the members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism for enabling us to postpone this item until today. As we see, we have achieved a broad consensus in favour.\nPresident\nWell, we have not voted yet, but I hope that you are right.\nMathieu Grosch\nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, we have already held the debate on this item in Strasbourg, so I do not need to discuss it further today. For the so-called 12-day trips, we have achieved an excellent cross-party compromise, also with the submission of the outcomes of the social partners' negotiations. Indeed, we could say that we have improved upon the social partners' compromise here in the House. I hope that we will thus be able to conclude this matter very successfully with broad support.\nMay I also point out that the English text of Amendment 31 should be put to the vote, as I have noticed that a very important word has been omitted from the French and German texts.\nPresident\nThe various language versions will be checked.\n", "Motor Vehicle Block Exemption Regulation (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on:\nthe oral question to the Commission on the protection of consumer interests in competition rules for the motor vehicle sector in the internal market, by Malcolm Harbour, Andreas Schwab, Evelyne Gebhardt, Cristian Silviu Bu\u015foi, Adam Bielan, Heide R\u00fchle and Kyriacos Triantaphyllides, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (O-0044/201 - B7-0209/2010); and\nthe oral question to the Commission on the Motor Vehicle Block Exemption Regulation, by Sharon Bowles, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs - B7-0210/2010).\nTheodor Dumitru Stolojan\ndeputising for the author. - Mr President, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has put forward this question because it has followed with interest the review procedure of the Motor Vehicle Block Exemption Regulation, and some careful thinking has to be done.\nAs you know, block exemption regulations are very important instruments to the business community. This Regulation was adopted in 2002. At that time the Commission considered that there was an oligopolistic situation in the European car market, the six largest manufacturers in Europe having together a market share of 75%. Against this background, the Commission considers that the motor vehicle sector should not be brought within the General Vertical Block Exemption Regulation, and therefore adopted a specific regulation.\nThis Regulation will expire on 31 May 2010. The Commission now considers that the markets for new vehicles sales are highly competitive and that concentration levels have been declining. As a consequence of this assessment, the Commission proposes that a specific block exemption is no longer needed for the sale of new cars and commercial vehicles. It proposes to adopt a special block exemption regulation only for repair and maintenance services, as well as for the spare-parts distribution.\nParliament is concer", "'IASCF: Review of the constitution - Public Accountability and the Composition of the IASB Proposals for Change' (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the oral question by Pervenche Ber\u00e8s on IASCF: 'Review of the constitution - Public Accountability and the Composition of the IASB Proposals for Change' (B6-0463/2008).\nPervenche Ber\u00e8s\nMadam President, Commissioner, when it comes to financial reporting standards this Parliament now knows that you have a certain capacity for creativity, for setting up 'do nothing' committees. When at the start of this legislative term we questioned you about the statutes and role of EFRAG you invented the Roundtable and everybody now knows that it has not fulfilled its remit.\nFaced with proposals from the IASCF trustees about establishing a monitoring group, and as soon as some of the members failed to agree with your plans, you put forward the idea of setting up an international accounting advisory group.\nParliament has now got used to your practices. When we informed you of this, by taking the initiative for a report on questions relating to IASCF governance, you rushed off to officiate, with your Japanese and American colleagues and with IOSCO, by preparing a press release on 7 November 2007 in which you claimed to be arbitrating in all the problems of governance, rather than awaiting the opportunity to be able to act on the legitimacy and authority of a position taken by the democratic representation of the European Union, or to spell it out the European Parliament.\nWhen Parliament drew up this position on the initiative of our rapporteur, Mr Radwan, you preferred in March to put the debate back to April for reasons that concern you and for which you take sole responsibility.\nWhen, on the strength of the April proposals, you had the momentum and the opportunity to officiate on what could have been the European Union's position on the international stage, and to do so on the basis of paragraph 9 of this resolution, which I now read: ", "Outcome of World Summit on Sustainable Development\nPresident. -\nThe next item is the joint debate on:\nthe Council and Commission statements on the outcome of the World Summit on Sustainable Development;\nreport (A5-0237/2002) by Mrs Hulth\u00e9n, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Commission communication on the implementation of the first phase of the European Climate Change Programme [COM(2001) 580 - C5-0164/2002 - 2002/2072(COS)].\nIn opening this debate, I am pleased to be able to give the floor to President Haarder, formerly one of our fellow Members and Vice-President of the European Parliament, who will now speak on behalf of the Council as President-in-Office of the Council.\n\nHaarder\nMr President, thank you for your very friendly welcome. The World Summit in Johannesburg took place from 26 August to 4 September 2002. There was a very high level of participation from parliaments, NGOs and trade and industry. The Danish Presidency - the Danish Minister for the Environment - attached great importance to remaining in close contact with participants from the European Parliament. I believe a number of you present here will be able to confirm this.\nI would like to compliment Parliament on Mr Lannoye's report, which was adopted in April and was an important document in the whole process. We faced a great challenge. As a leading player, we had to encourage the viewpoints established at the previous Council meetings of Environment, Development and Foreign Ministers in Seville. We had to achieve a good outcome and obtain the greatest possible influence, and that was not a particularly easy task in view of the many viewpoints and divergent interests with which we are all familiar.\nAs you know, the decision to hold the summit was taken by the UN General Assembly in autumn 2000, the same year in which the Millennium Summit adopted the eight Millennium Goals for reducing poverty by 2015. The mandate from the General Assembly f", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 5 April.\n\nAgenda\nPresident\nThe order of business was established on 2 April, but I have received a number of proposals for amendments.\nRelating to Wednesday 2 May:\nThe Commission communication will deal with our partnership with the United Nations in the areas of development and humanitarian issues and will be made by Commissioner Nielson.\nThe second item of information I have is that on 11 April, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market approved the report by Mr MacCormick on the request for the waiver of Mrs Jeggle' s immunity. Pursuant to Rule 6(6) of the Rules of Procedure, this report has been placed at the head of the agenda and will be followed immediately by Mr Zimeray' s report on the request for the waiver of Mr Voggenhuber' s immunity.\n\nMacCormick\nMadam President, according to Rule 6(6) of the Rules of the Procedure, committee reports concerning immunity of Members shall be placed at the head of the agenda. Recent events have reminded us that questions of immunity are not mere matters of form, but go to the substance of great issues of democracy in Europe and you have, indeed, alluded to that yourself.\nAre you certain that it satisfies Rule 6(6) to take these issues of immunity after the Commission communication which appears to have been placed at the head of the agenda ahead of the issues of immunity? Is that a correct interpretation of Rule 6?\n\nPresident\nMr MacCormick, you are quite right and you will be pleased, since the three reports on waivers of immunity have been placed at the head of the agenda, after the Commission communication and before Mr Cashman' s report on public access to documents.\n\n \n\nWurtz\nMadam President, am I right in assuming that the item on Turkish prisoners on hunger strike has not been included in today' s agenda?\n\nPresident\nYes, Mr Wurtz, you are right.

This was the first step towards a coherent policy in one of the most sensitive areas in Europe, and it was a step in the right direction because the Black Sea is now widely analysed - and feared - as a converging space of political, strategic and security hopes, strengths and ambitions.\nToday, our policy in the area can be further developed. This House can play a crucial role in upgrading EU policies to a fully-fledged EU strategy. This is actually the main idea in the report I initiated with the support of my colleagues from the Foreign Affairs Committee and Parliament as a whole.\nBut why a new report on the Black Sea and why an EU strategy for the Black Sea? Some people would say that the Black Sea is a small sea. Indeed it is, but if we exchange this map for a strategy map, the Black Sea becomes huge. There is also another factor: the Black Sea is getting blacker and blacker.\nSince the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, the Black Sea is now partially an internal EU sea. However, developments in the region are often unpredictable: tensions accumulate and misunderstandings abound. A summary analysis of the Black Sea region leads to the conclusion that the negative challenges in this area persist or are, indeed, gaining in intensity. The Georgia-Russia war of 2008, the unsolved and so-called 'frozen' conflicts, and the worrying deterioration of democratic rule in Ukraine and Russia are all very serious developments and vivid examples of the security risks in the area.\nIf we examine the current results of EU involvement in the region, they seem at least mixed. The EU policy approach towards the Black Sea lacks mechanisms for monitoring, evaluation and follow-up.", "Award of the Sakharov Prize (formal sitting) \nPresident\nDear President-in-Office Chastel, dear High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the Commission Lady Ashton, dear guests,\nGuillermo Fari\u00f1as\n(ES) A message to the European Parliament: Santa Clara, 14 December 2010\nDear Mr Jerzy Buzek, President of the European Parliament,\nDear Vice-Presidents and honourable Members of this multi-national democratic forum,\nUnfortunately, for want of the tolerance that we so much need on this tormented planet of ours, I cannot be with you as a representative of the Cuban people in rebellion and those Cuban citizens who have lost their dread of the totalitarian government which has been repressing us for a shameful total of 52 years, whose latest victim is the martyr Orlando Zapata Tamayo.\nUnluckily for those who misgovern us in our own homeland the fact that I cannot leave and return voluntarily to the island where I was born is, in itself, the most irrefutable witness to the fact that unfortunately, nothing has changed in the autocratic system ruling my country.\nIn the minds of Cuba's current rulers, we Cuban citizens are just like the slaves from whom I am descended, kidnapped in Africa and brought to the Americas by force. For me or any other ordinary citizen to be able to travel abroad, I need a Carta de Libertad, that is a Freedom Card, just as the slaves did: only today it is called a Carta Blanca, a White Card.\nMy deepest hope is that you will not allow yourselves to be deceived by the siren songs of a cruel regime practising 'wild communism' whose only desire, after pretending to make ostensible economic changes, is that the European Union and the European Parliament will rescind the Common Position, and allow the regime to benefit from the loans and investments used to help Third World countries under the Cotonou Agreements.\nFormer political prisoners or prisoners of conscience, recently released by 'wild communism', will s", "Welcome\nPresident\nIt is my pleasure to welcome a delegation of political representatives and other visitors from the Canadian Parliament and from the Canadian Mission to the European Union, who are seated in the official gallery.

The corresponding resolution was adopted by the European Parliament on 23 March 2006. The Commission's proposal introduces a new element: the possibility of funding European political foundations bearing in mind that these have an important role to play in underpinning and promoting the activities and objectives of the political parties at European level.\nSince the political foundations are closely affiliated with the European political parties, it is proposed that they must submit their application for funding through the political party at European level with which they are linked, under the same legal basis as applies to the latter's funding, in other words under Article 191 of the EC Treaty.\nI know that the political parties represented in this House are forming or have already formed foundations at European level. The Council looks favourably on the possibility of providing Community financial support for the activities of these foundations under very clear rules which will allow, among other aspects, a clear distinction to be made between the areas of intervention of the parties which must be complementary and not overlapping.\nThe second main aim of the Commission's proposal is to revise the financi", "Statement by the President\nPresident\nOn 1 December two members of the Spanish security forces were shot by the terrorist organisation ETA in Capbreton in France. A young, 24-year-old Spanish police officer, Ra\u00fal Centeno, died instantly and a second police officer, Fernando Trapero, aged 23, was seriously injured and died last Wednesday.\nLadies and gentlemen, on behalf of you all I should like to convey our sincere sympathy to the members of the victims' families.\nI should also like to send a message of solidarity to the Spanish people, the Spanish authorities, the country's democratic institutions and the security forces in particular. The European Parliament denounces every kind of violence as a means to an end. Terrorism is an assault on freedom and democracy. Terrorism must be fought and eliminated using every means available under the rule of law. There can be no justification for terror. We must not show any weakness when fighting terrorism. The terrorist threat will therefore never succeed in bringing democracy to its knees!\nI am sure that we are all in agreement on these principles. Thank you.\n(Applause)\n", "4. UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (\n- After the vote\nGay Mitchell\nMadam President, a vote was defeated because there was an equal number of votes just a couple of moments ago. A Member has made a very serious allegation about voting in the Chamber. I would ask you to halt proceedings until we find out whether there are Members voting who should not be voting, or whether this allegation is false. It is a very serious allegation.\n(Applause)\nPresident\nI have just said that it will be verified. That means that it will be verified immediately. We are dealing with it.\nBruno Gollnisch\n- (FR) Madam President, I will be very brief on this point. As one of our fellow Members has made an accusation, I will ask him to clarify his accusation. As you said, the verification needs to take place immediately, and if, as I believe, it turns out after verification that the accusation is false, I ask that all the conclusions be drawn from this.\nPresident\nI said that the verification would be done. It is going to be done immediately, so I will keep you informed in the next few minutes.\n", "The dramatic consequences of the 'Klaus'  storm in Southern Europe (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the dramatic consequences of the 'Klaus' storm in Southern Europe.\nAndroulla Vassiliou\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, the European Commission wishes to express its sadness at the number of lives claimed by storm Klaus and sends its condolences to the French, Italian and Spanish families that have lost loved ones. This is indeed a human tragedy, which has had a devastating impact on people's lives, homes and businesses. It is also an ecological disaster.\nWhile this storm was extremely powerful, it only affected a narrow band of territory, and national resources have been able to cope with the immediate disaster response.\nFor this reason, the Community Civil Protect Mechanism was not activated. However, the Commission's Monitoring and Information Centre has been in close contact with the concerned Member States from the first moments when the storm was forecast.\nOther Member States were aware of the situation and were getting prepared to provide support to the affected regions. For example, the Czech Republic spontaneously offered its assistance.\nThe Commission is now cooperating with the authorities of the Member States affected in order to identify options for EU support. Possibilities may include through the EU Solidarity Fund or a reprogramming of the structural and rural development funds.\nStorm Klaus is an unpleasant reminder that natural disasters are a growing threat for all EU Member States. Devastating floods hit Central Europe in 2000 and 2002, the UK in 2007, and Romania and EU neighbours last year. The 2003 heatwave claimed tens of thousands of lives. In 2003 and 2007 forest fires ravaged Portugal and Greece. These events give us an idea of how climate change is likely to affect the EU's future because, as the climate changes, we can expect more extreme weather events.\nThe Member States and the Community need to co", "Impact of EU development policy (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Filip Kaczmarek, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on increasing the impact of EU development policy.\nFilip Kaczmarek\nMr President, the report which we will be voting on tomorrow is important for the future of the EU's development cooperation. Why? In October, the European Commission will present a communication on future European Development Policy Priorities. Towards the end of the year, the Commission will also present a legislative proposal for a future instrument for development cooperation, and in Busan, South Korea, there will be another High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness. The Busan Forum is in fact one of the Polish Presidency's development priorities. This is, therefore, a good time for Parliament to present its own expectations of future EU development policy.\nThe basis for discussion on this subject and for our report is the Green Paper on inclusive growth and sustainable development, presented by the European Commission last year. Within the Committee on Development we achieved a wide-ranging political consensus, and we agree with many of the proposals put forward by Commissioner Piebalgs and the Commission as a whole. We believe that development cooperation must concentrate more on outcomes and concrete results than has been the case so far. However, at the same time this does not mean that we want to convert indicators and measures into absolutes. We should avoid a situation where our attention is focused on 'easy' countries or sectors, those in which it would be easy to obtain results and not those where the need is greatest. We should not forget aid for those hit hardest by poverty and those who have had the bad luck to be born in countries which are very badly governed.\nOn the other hand, it is worth remembering that 72% of poor people throughout the world do not live in the world's poorest countries, but in middle-income countries.

Madagascar\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Madagascar.\nRa\u00fcl Romeva i Rueda\nauthor. - Mr President, this is indeed a topic for decision. It is a topic we have to discuss. There is a political crisis in Madagascar and this brings us to the necessity of responding accordingly to the necessities also of the country.\nThe power-sharing deal has been negotiated under the auspices of the African Union between the current President Rajoelina and the former President Ravalomanana.\nThere is the Maputo Agreement and Addis Ababa Additional Act, which remain the only political and democratic solution to the current crisis. We must not forget this. The Maputo Agreement foresees the establishment of a national unity government with a transition period of 15 months.\nLet me signal as well that, after this fact, there are some specific and local situations that are worrying in terms of the government issuing a decree legalising the export of unprocessed and endangered wood threatening the biodiversity of the country. This might cause a lot of problems in the future because they can be lost forever.\nIn this context, we have to remind the Commission and the Member States that to send an election observation operation to Madagascar could be a mistake. We ask not to send a delegation to this country under the current circumstances, to the elections the current government is organising in March, as these elections circumvent the Maputo Agreement. I insist: in this framework, under this consensus and on the basis of the agreement in Maputo, we should not follow this observation election mission.\nThis has to be accompanied as well by full respect of human rights in the country and full respect of democratic principles and the rule of law. If these conditions are fulfilled then we can talk about this, but in the current situation, in the current context, I think it would be a mistake.\nRenate Weber\nMr President, problems of instability persist in Mada", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 27 October 2000.\n\nStatement by the President\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, as you will be aware, last month saw the names of four more victims being added to the intolerable list of those who have lost their lives in Spain as a result of terrorist attacks by ETA.

If Parliament expresses a favourable opinion, and if the accession treaty is signed on 25 April in Luxembourg, as scheduled, we will have the great pleasure of receiving amongst us, firstly, the Bulgarian observers, and then the Members who will sit in this House.\nMinister, I wish you a happy stay in the European Parliament.\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Today, ladies and gentlemen, we are celebrating International Women\u2019s Day. We have been doing so for more than 90 years, but, despite this celebration, every day millions of women throughout the world still suffer discrimination on the grounds of gender and abuse of all kinds, both in times of peace and in times of war. They are still the victims of physical, psychological, sexual and economic violence, violence which sometimes comes from within their closest family environment.\nJust a few days ago we saw horrific images of Turkish riot police putting down a demonstration of women ahead of today\u2019s Women\u2019s Day. I had the opportunity to condemn these actions yesterday in plenary. I have asked the Turkish Government to punish the perpetrators of these indescribable actions and I would like to point out that they do not, of course, send the best possible message in terms of Turkey\u2019s possible accession.\nLadies and gentlemen, at the moment and until 11\u00a0March, the United Nations are hosting a World Conference on gender equality to review the progress made since the Beijing Conference of 19", "2.

I must welcome that very wide support, because if it is confirmed by Parliament in plenary we shall be able to participate fully in the work currently being done by the Commission on drawing up a communication for next autumn on internal market strategy for the twenty-first century, and to influence that work to the full.\nThe internal market has been the main achievement of the European Union in over 50 years. It is at the heart of European integration and now the Lisbon Strategy. It is, however, a constantly evolving process and we need above all to approach it from a political standpoint. That is, in my opinion, the most original feature of the report I am submitting to you.\nEurope is going through a very unsettled period and it is important to realise that the internal market cannot be developed if it continues to face widespread scepticism and indeed hostility from the public, who often see the internal market and competition policy as the root causes of many of the social problems our citizens are experiencing.\nAny internal market strategy must therefore be aimed at turning that lack of belief and that hostility into confidence in the internal market, partly by drawing attention to its benefits and partly by, at the same time, pursuing the aims of openness and competition and of social cohesion with its various components: the environment, employment, culture, access for the vulnerable.\nIn our report w", "4.

The real number of people seeking work is undoubtedly considerably higher than that. All the experts agree that there is no magic formula for combatting unemployment, but that there are a number of possibilities. In the 1993 White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment, one of the objectives set out was to harness new employment opportunities in the national economies of Europe, in particular in the services sector. This was to be done by opening up to the employment market needs that had so far not been met. One year later, in 1994, at the Essen Summit, the Council asked the Commission to prepare appropriate measures.\nThe communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on a European strategy for encouraging local development and employment initiatives, of 13 June 1995, also contains, in addition to an excellent analysis, important proposals, which will have to be implemented in all Member States of the EU as quickly as possible, if governments really are serious about reducing unemployment. For example, the Commission is proposing the following seventeen fields on the supply side to be included in the encouragement of local development and employment initiatives: home help, child care, local shops and handicrafts, assistance for and integration of young people facing difficulties, better housing, security, local public transport services, refurbishment of public facilities in urban areas, tourism, audiovisual service", "Requesting an opinion from the Court of Justice on the compatibility with the Treaties of the Protocol on the EU-Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement (motion for a resolution tabled): see Minutes\n(La sesi\u00f3n, suspendida a las 11.40 horas, se reanuda a las 12.00 horas)\n", "International Climate Policy post-Copenhagen: Reinvigorating the international negotiations through immediate action\nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by the Commission on International Climate Policy post-Copenhagen: Reinvigorating the international negotiations through immediate action.\nConnie Hedegaard\nMember of the Commission. - Madam President, this is the first time I have spoken before this House. I am glad that, less than four weeks after I took office, I can today present to you a communication on international climate change policy post Copenhagen - a communication that the Commission adopted in its meeting today.\nThe communication is entitled 'Acting now to reinvigorate global action and climate change', and that is exactly what we aim to do. Naturally, in drafting the communication, we have taken full account of Parliament's resolution of 10 February on the outcome of COP 15.\nCopenhagen was a much smaller step forward than the European Union had wanted but, nonetheless, it was a step forward. One hundred and nine countries - industrialised and developing nations alike which are collectively responsible for more than 80% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions - have now officially included their emission reduction targets and actions in the Accord. In other words, the opportunity is there for us to build on this determination and help channel it into international action. We need to seize this chance to help maintain momentum towards the robust and legally binding global climate agreement for the post-2012 period which, of course, remains our objective.\nThe Commission's starting point is that the EU must continue to show leadership. We believe that the most convincing way Europe can do so is by taking tangible and determined action domestically to become the most climate-friendly region in the world. We must do this as part of the EU 2020 strategy put forward last week. And let me say this loud and clear: it is in Europe's own interest. How is tha", "Certain issues relating to motor insurance (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Mladenov, on behalf of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on certain issues relating to motor insurance.\nNickolay Mladenov\nrapporteur. - Mr President, Madam Commissioner, colleagues, and interpreters who are staying this late on such an interesting day as today with the European Council discussing Georgia, I hope you will have a little time and energy to focus on another report which is, despite its technicality, quite important for all of us.\nIt goes back to an issue raised in this House when the fourth Motor Insurance Directive was adopted. Back then, this House decided to ask the Commission to undertake a more in-depth study of a number of questions that were raised by Parliament but were not addressed in the fourth Motor Insurance Directive itself. Namely these three sets of questions: the first being to look into whether the national penalty provisions are effectively implemented across the European Union; then to look at how the claims representative system set up under the directive functions and whether there is a need to harmonise across the European Union; and finally to look at perhaps the most important and controversial issue that is intimately connected to questions raised by consumers which is whether the current availability of voluntary legal expenses schemes for motor insurance in Europe should be converted into a compulsory scheme to cover cross-border accidents across the European Union.\nLet me start with the last question because that is perhaps the most important question and clearly one of the questions which is of most interest to European consumers. I myself when I went looking into this report was very much tempted to argue for harmonisation and to argue for compulsory legal expenses insurance across the European Union. But detailed study suggested that that might not be in the interests of the consumers or in the interest", "Statement by the President\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you that Lithuania celebrated the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Lithuanian independence movement S\u0105j\u016bdis yesterday.

My warmest congratulations!\n(Applause)\nI would like to make you aware of the Green Weeks that are taking place in Brussels this week and in Luxembourg and Strasbourg in the next two weeks. The central topics will be CO2 emissions and the associated climate change. We have undertaken to reduce the European Parliament's CO2 emissions by 30% by the year 2020. In order to achieve this, a prestigious consulting firm is preparing a CO2 assessment for us, which will be ready in September and will be presented to the Bureau.

I especially want to welcome the arrival of Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia.\nOur borders have expanded to 25 countries and the bounds of the European Parliament\u2019s activities will also be expanding, in a Europe that started as the Coal and Steel and the Atomic Energy Communities, which then became the Common Market and afterwards a common currency in order to encourage financial exchange and trade, and which now, with the implementation of the Lisbon Agenda and the commitments of the European Constitution, is beginning to turn into a Europe of work, solidarity, social justice, reception and integration: in a word, a Europe of the people and of its citizens. A Europe open to the world, to the suffering and aspirations of other peoples in all countries; above all, a Europe open to peace and the search for personal and collective security.(1)\n\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013 Pursuant to the Rules of Procedure, I have received the following nominations for the presidency of the European Parliament:\nJosep Borrel Fontelles\nBronis\u0142aw Geremek\nFrancis Wurtz\nThe candidates have informed me that they consent to their respective nominations.

Uganda: anti-homosexual draft legislation\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution on the anti-homosexual draft legislation in Uganda.\nMichael Cashman\nauthor. - Mr President, I crave the House's indulgence, if we can move away from points of order and to the issue of discrimination.\nThere is currently a bill before the Ugandan Parliament, and some argue: what is it to do with us? Breaches of international obligations, the Cotonou agreement and breaches of human rights - as we have always shown - have everything to do with us.\nThis bill's provisions are draconian and among them, let me inform the House, are: any person alleged to be homosexual would be at risk of life imprisonment or in some circumstances the death penalty; any parent who does not denounce their lesbian daughter or gay son to the authorities would face fines and probably three years in prison; any teacher who does not report a lesbian or gay pupil to the authorities within 24 hours would face the same penalties; any landlord or landlady who happens to give housing to a 'suspected' homosexual would risk seven years of imprisonment.\nSimilarly, the bill threatens to punish or ruin the reputation of anyone who works with a gay or lesbian population, such as medical doctors working on AIDS and HIV, civil society leaders active in the fields of sexual and reproductive health, hence, further undermining public health efforts to counter the spread of HIV.\nIt is vital that this afternoon in this House we put aside our prejudices and we defend those who have no one left to defend them. Therefore, I warmly welcome the statement by the Commissioner on Development and Humanitarian Aid, Commissioner De Gucht, statements from the British, French and Swedish Governments as well as President Obama and the Chair and Vice-Chair of the US House of Representatives' Committee on Foreign Affairs. I urge the House to give this the high importance which it deserves and to speak out for those i", "Investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Community (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Adina-Ioana V\u0103lean, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council regulation concerning the notification to the Commission of investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Community and repealing Regulation (EC) No 736/96 - C7-0125/2009 -.\nAdina-Ioana V\u0103lean\nrapporteur. - Madam President, I fully appreciate your presence in the plenary this evening. I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for our fruitful discussions and our work on this report. The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is giving the European Union more competence in the field of energy policy. I believe this is an area where, if Member States work together, Europe can ensure secure, cheaper and more efficient energy for its citizens. Together, we can minimise the impact of unpredictable events, such as the gas disruption Europe experienced last winter.\nOf course, Europe cannot interfere in gas flow outside its borders or solve such disputes, but what we can do is ensure that our infrastructure is able to cope with supply shortages or failures, and make the market more transparent and efficient. Europe has set this priority very high on its agenda. Last year, we adopted a third energy package which aims to ensure a more competitive and efficient energy market. A regulation on the security of gas supplies is currently on the table in Parliament and tomorrow's vote on the regulation on notification of investments in energy infrastructure will contribute to making the market more transparent and more predictable.\nIn this context, I think it would be a pity to waste the opportunity this new instrument offers, by not applying the correct legal basis provided by the new Article 194 of the Lisbon Treaty. It is a very important institutional, political and legal point. This regulation is not only a tool for c", "2. Case against Rios Montt\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on five motions for resolutions on the case against Rios Montt.\nLuis Y\u00e1\u00f1ez-Barnuevo Garc\u00eda \nauthor. - (ES) Mr President, unlike Tibet, we have not often talked about Guatemala in this House, at least since I have been here. Nevertheless, it is a small Central America country that has suffered very harsh repression for many years, a brutal dictatorship, and the people responsible for it have so far escaped any form of punishment.\nThe Spanish High Court has issued an international arrest warrant and what we are doing here is supporting the extradition of General R\u00edos Montt, the person bearing the greatest responsibility, and of five other generals, some of whom were de facto Presidents, that is, dictators, during that thirty-year period in which 200 000 people were murdered, 45 000 disappeared and a tenth of the population was displaced; the enormous majority of the displaced population - 83% - belonged to the Mayan community. There have also been European victims, however, Belgian and Spanish, particularly priests.\nI believe, Mr President, that just as we in this House supported the extradition of Pinochet and of Fujimori, it is right for us now to support the extradition of General R\u00edos Montt and his accomplices, and unanimously if possible.\nRa\u00fcl Romeva i Rueda \nauthor. - (ES) Mr President, I naturally agree with what my colleague, Mr Y\u00e1\u00f1ez-Barnuevo, has just said, because ten years after the peace agreements in Guatemala were signed, a country that has aspirations to be a member of the Security Council and with which an association agreement is being negotiated, has yet to implement the global agreement on human rights. That is truly worrying in a country which, as has been pointed out, has been the victim of dictatorships, genocides, crimes against humanity, and - most seriously - the people responsible for them are still lording it around the country and around the world unpunished.\nWe must therefor", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 29 January 1998.\n\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, since we last met there have been renewed acts of terrorism in three Member States of the European Union. The prefect of Corsica, Claude Erignac, the French State representative in that region, was murdered in Ajaccio on 6 February. On 30 January in Seville the terrorist organization ETA murdered another town councillor belonging to the Partido Popular , Alberto Jim\u00e9nez Becerril, and in this case they also murdered his wife, Ascensi\u00f3n Garc\u00eda. Similarly, the Northern Ireland peace process has come under attack once more through repeated terrorist acts against the people of Ulster.\nEven at the risk of repeating ourselves, I believe it is the duty of our Parliament to speak out in condemnation once more. All these acts of terrorism must produce the same clear, downright repugnance in us, the representatives of the people of Europe, just as they also provoke renewed interest in increasing antiterrorist cooperation within the Union.\nTerrorism, no matter what its political objectives, consists of nothing more than an extremely serious infringement of the right to live, which is the first and most important of all human rights.\nI have sent the appropriate telegrams of condolence and solidarity to the respective governments, acting in my capacity of interpreter of the sentiments of this House.\nI call on you now to join with me in a minute's silence as a tribute in memory of the victims\n(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)\n\nTourism\nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following reports:\nA4-0040/98 by Mr De Luca, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the Court of Auditors' Special Report No 3/96 on tourist policy and the promotion of tourism; -A4-0049/98 by Mrs Wemheuer, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the Commission's conduct in respect of alleged fraud", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nSpencer\nMr President, we received the news overnight that Ibrahim Rugova is now in Rome, and I wonder whether you could ask the President if he would, on behalf of this Parliament, convey our best wishes to Mr Rugova and to his family. You will recall that in the April plenary we passed a resolution in this House inviting Mr Rugova to address the Foreign Affairs Committee. It is proposed that we hold a Foreign Affairs Committee meeting on 21-22 June for the purpose of a hearing with the High Representative. However, it would seem to me at the very least appropriate that we should invite Mr Rugova also to address that committee. What are your comments on that suggestion, and could you convey that idea to the President?\n\nPresident\nThank you for that suggestion, Mr Spencer. We have all heard that Mr Rugova has arrived in Rome, happily with his family, and I think it is natural for him to come here to Parliament. I shall pass on your proposal to the President, and I do not think there is any obstacle to inviting him to come to Parliament on 21 June.\n\nMaes\nMr President, in all the confusion during the vote on the Rothley report yesterday I mistakenly voted in favour in the final vote, when I actually meant to vote against. I would ask you to amend the Minutes to show this. It would not change the outcome of the vote, ladies and gentlemen, but it really was all very confusing. I would specifically request that this should be done if at all possible. I would also ask you to note that I did vote on Amendment No 18 by Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, but my vote is not shown in the Minutes. I actually voted in favour.\n\nPresident\nWe have noted that, Mrs Maes, and it will be recorded in the Minutes.\n\nFabre-Aubrespy\nMr President, on page 8 of the Minutes, under the heading 'Approval of the President-designate of the Commission', there is a record of Parliament's vote approving", "Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme (BONUS-169) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Ek, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the participation of the Community in a Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme (BONUS-169) undertaken by several Member States - C7-0263/2009 -.\nLena Ek\nMr President, in 150 years, the Baltic Sea has gone from an untouched, clear, oligotrophic Arctic sea to one in a constant state of crisis. The problems of eutrophication, algal blooms, toxic waste and threatened biodiversity are growing ever greater. The situation in the Baltic Sea is very serious. Despite successful attempts in the 1990s and 2000s to reduce the input of nitrogen and phosphorus, almost the whole of the Baltic Sea is currently suffering the effects of eutrophication. Similarly, the levels of environmental toxins and heavy metals are high, despite success in reducing the discharge of lead, mercury and DDT, for example.\nI do not know whether any of you have seen the algal bloom in this large, previously healthy, inland sea. If you go out in a boat in the wonderful archipelago in summer, you are met by a decimetre-thick green, foul-smelling layer of algae. If dogs drink the water they die, and if children bathe in it they vomit and suffer an upset stomach. That is the situation in many places around the Baltic Sea today. In order to safeguard growth and enable our rural communities to thrive in the future too, it is vital that we increase our knowledge of the impact on the Baltic Sea.\nThe ecosystem of the Baltic Sea area is complex and impossible to understand without cooperation between researchers across borders throughout the whole of the catchment area into this inland sea. A great deal of research along these lines is already being carried out, but often without adequate coordination.

Ladies and gentlemen, President-in-Office, many documents, including the 2005 Decision of the European Parliament on the Roma, the 2004 study by the European Commission, the report on Roma women by the European Parliament Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and the EUROSTAT action plan of 2003 were clearly drafted in order to solve the untenable situation of European Roma.\nNonetheless, neither the Member States nor the European institutions have really moved forward in promoting the inclusion of the Roma, although it is in the interests of both the European labour market and European societies successfully to integrate Europe's most populous and fastest-growing minority.\nThe recommendation of the report presented last December by the high-level advisory group set up by Commissioner \u0160pidla was that a Community action plan should be created. This action plan must be created, although much stronger and more genuine commitment is needed from the Commission in order to take effective, immediate measures. This also applies to the European Parliament and civil society in many areas affecting the Roma.\nThe European Commission and Member States must instigate, fund, monitor and implement aid directly from Union sources ", "6. Multiannual Financial Framework for 2007-2013 (\nReimer B\u00f6ge\nMadam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important issue and I will be really brief. Article 3 of the existing budgetary agreement makes it necessary to adjust the budgetary framework and political agreements accordingly when dealing with amendments to the Treaty with consequences for the budget. We have held long discussions with the Belgian and Hungarian Presidencies in an attempt to achieve the necessary changes. Unfortunately, despite all their efforts, the Presidencies did not receive a sufficient mandate from the Council.\nThe present offer from the Council is less than what Parliament already has under the existing interinstitutional agreement. The Treaty of Lisbon was not intended to limit the privileges and decision-making options open to the European Parliament. The fact is that no serious negotiations have taken place. In fact, what the Council is offering actually reduces budgetary flexibility from its current position. For this reason, the Committee on Budgets recommends that you vote against this proposal, rejecting it and moving directly on to the negotiations for the next financial framework.\n(Applause)\n", "Debate on the future of Europe (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the future of Europe, with the participation of the Irish Prime Minister, member of the European Council.\nDuring this debate - for the first time and on an exceptional basis - we will have simultaneous interpreting from Irish into all of the official languages.\n(Applause)\nThis first item on the agenda is scheduled to last until 4.30 p.m. After that we will have the Council and Commission statements on the Russia-EU Summit. Speaking times will have to conform to that timetable.\nI would like to begin by welcoming the Prime Minister of Ireland on behalf of the European Parliament.\nTaoiseach,\nin a few weeks time, in the new year, our Parliament will adopt Irish as the twenty-first official language. In this multilingual House we will do everything we can to respect the commitments made in the Treaties and the rights of all languages to be used here.\nOur visitor today - the Irish Taoiseach - is someone who has been taking part in the European Council for a long time. He is one of the doyens of the European Council, having been a member since 1997 (nearly ten years ago).\nHe began as head of the Irish Government a few days after the Amsterdam European Council, which was the first failed attempt at a serious reform of the European institutions.\nHe then lived through the Nice marathon, which led to a Treaty seen as unsatisfactory from an institutional point of view.\nThat Treaty of Nice was rejected by the Irish people in a referendum in 2001. But the Irish Prime Minister took on the challenge of carrying out an intensive public information campaign and, as a result, in the second referendum held 18 months later, in 2002, Ireland approved the Treaty of Nice. The European Parliament was delighted and congratulated him enthusiastically.\nThen he held the Presidency of the European Council during the Intergovernmental Conference on the Constitutional Treaty, in June 2004.

If possible, therefore, we would like to be able to continue working tomorrow and vote on the report on Wednesday. \nPronk (PPE-DE ).\n\u00a0\u00a0  Mr President, I support this proposal because it gives us a chance to find a solution to this very cumbersome dossier. \n\n As regards the oral questions on nuclear disarmament, I have received a request from the Verts/ALE Group to wind up the debate with a motion for a resolution which could be put to the vote at the next sitting in Brussels. \nFrassoni (Verts/ALE ).\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013 Mr\u00a0President, the aim of the resolution is to prepare the guidelines before the conference to revise the Treaty of Non-Proliferation.\nTraditionally, we conclude such debates with a resolution; it therefore seemed right to do so in this case too, even though the resolution will be put to the vote during the next sitting. \nSchulz (PSE ).\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013 Mr President, I believe that this is one of the most important policy issues currently under consideration and discussion in the sphere of international politics.

Financial year 2008 as modified by the Council (vote) \n- Financial year 2008\n- Before the vote:\nKy\u00f6sti Virrankoski  \nrapporteur. - Mr President, the second reading budget conciliation between the two arms of the Budgetary Authority was held on 23 November 2007. Parliament achieved a budget for results on its major objectives: financing for Galileo (EUR 2.4 billion) via a revision of the 2007-2013 multiannual financial framework (MFF) and the use of the flexibility instrument (EUR 200 million); significant further use of the flexibility instrument (EUR 70 million) to finance an increase in the spending on common foreign and security policy (CFSP).\nThe Committee on Budgets voted its second reading amendments, further to the conciliation outcome, on 29 November 2007. After the technical check of the figures, a small number of technical adjustments were necessary to ensure full respect of the conciliation outcome of 23 November as regards revised financial framework ceilings and the overall level of payments.\nThe agreed modifications are the following:\nFirst, in heading 1a, commitment appropriations are adjusted as follows:\nAmendment 335:\n06 02 09 01 (Galileo Supervisory Authority) to EUR 7 460 000\n06 02 09 02 (Galileo Supervisory Authority) to EUR 3 100 000\n08 07 01 (Research Cooperation - Transport) to EUR 348 922 000\nAmendment 331:\n02 02 01 (Competitiveness and Innovation) to EUR 126 300 000\nAmendment 69:\n06 03 03 (TENs - T) to EUR 955 852 600\nSecond, in heading 1b, in order to meet the overall level of payments agreed at the conciliation, payment appropriations are modified on lines:\nAmendment 27:\n04 02 17 (ESF) to EUR 3 823 198 181\nAmendment 140:\n13 03 16 (ERDF convergence) to EUR 10 606 637 496\nAmendment 141:\n13 03 18 (ERDF competitiveness) to EUR 2 540 832 078\nAll these technical adjustments were unanimously approved by the Committee on Budgets on Monday 10 December.\nThird, a number of technical/nomenclature changes will be made, mainly as regards pilot projec", "1.

For the sake of uniformity of treatment, the Legal Affairs Committee is in favour of amending the Commission proposal (Article 12 of the First Banking Directive) to give the relevant Member States the opportunity in future, in addition to the exchanges of information in which banking supervisory authorities may already engage with their counterparts in their own country, in other Member States and in third countries, to conclude cooperation agreements on the exchanging of information with non-banking supervisory authorities in third countries too. This, however, will only be permissible if the information disclosed in such cases is subject to guarantees of banking secrecy which are at least equivalent to those in force in the European Union.\nThe p", "One-minute speeches on matters of political importance\nPresident\nThe next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.\nArturs Kri\u0161j\u0101nis Kari\u0146\u0161\n(LV) Mr President, the whole of the European Union is feeling the global economic crisis, but the recession has had its most serious effects in the Baltic States. For these states, the way out of the economic crisis is closely linked to a full transition to the euro. Although, since 2005, all the Baltic currencies have been directly pegged to the euro, because of the official Maastricht criteria they still cannot fully join the euro area. It is therefore the case that the Baltic States are suffering from the European Central Bank's low interest rate policy, which brought the loans and property bubbles to a head, but they are prevented from enjoying the true fruits of currency stability. I call upon you to take a political decision so that the euro can be introduced in the Baltic States on an exceptional basis. The small economies of these states are not a threat to the euro area. The threat is instability in the region, if these countries remain outside the euro area. Thank you for your attention.\nAlexander Mirsky\n(LV) Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the very dangerous economic situation in the Republic of Latvia. Currently, there is a plan in the country to close 50% of the hospitals. In some regions, unemployment is at 25%. In Latgale, 50% of workers have been laid off. 30% of police officers, 30% of schoolteachers and 30% of doctors have lost their jobs. The tax reforms, which are designed to increase taxes, will lead to the utter collapse of the economy. In this situation, instead of assistance, Latvia is being offered loans, which demand even more cuts to the very small budget. Things have now gone so far that some Swedish ministers are literally blackmailing the Latvian Government, demanding a reduction in funding. All this has led to a social explosion .", "6.

Inevitably, there are a small number of technical adjustments that I hereby request be put to the vote in plenary.\nRegarding the European Economic Recovery Plan, the Committee adopted two new paragraphs to be added to budget lines 06 04 14 01, 06 04 14 02 and 06 04 14 03. They should be in addition to the existing budget remarks but, due to a technical error, they are shown as replacing them. Amendment 832 should, therefore, be adjusted accordingly.\nAfter verification of the margins, the vote in committee left a margin of EUR 1 775 000 in Heading 3b. I propose allocating this amount to the Europe for Citizens programme. This would mean that Amendment 889 on budget line 15 06 66 should be modified to give total commitment appropriations of EUR 32 255 000 and the retabled Amendment 547 is therefore covered.\nThe words 'sustainable and environmentally-friendly actions ...

He was born on 29 October 1951 in Coimbra and was only 55 years old. He leaves a wife and three sons. An illustrious career as a barrister, journalist and then a politician in Portugal followed after he finished law school at university in his home town of Coimbra. He was for a long time a Member of the Portuguese Parliament as well as Minster of State under Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. He had been a Member of the European Parliament since 2004. Fausto Correia was and remains famous and well-loved in Portugal for his unremitting, life-long mission to establish democracy and his dedication to the core values of fraternity and neighbourliness. Fausto Correia will be sorely missed by his family, his friends and by us, his fellow Members.\nA book of condolences for messages of sympathy from Members and staff of the European Parliament will be open during this week's sitting on Wednesday and Thursday at the front of the Chamber.\nIt is with great sadness that we learnt of the death of our former fellow Member Christian de la Mal\u00e8ne, who was a Member of the European Parliament on two occasions - from 1959 to 1961 and from 1962 to 1994. Christian de la Mal\u00e8ne, who was also a former Minister and Senator under President De Gaulle, died on 26 September at the age of 86. As a former Chairman of the Group of European Progressive Democrats and the Group of the European Renewal and Democratic Alliance, Christian de la Mal\u00e8ne was a convinced European in heart and mind.

I know about these two attacks but perhaps it has also happened to many more people. It would not be an understatement to say today that this is an intolerable situation. We have long since exceeded the level of what is acceptable. I would be very grateful if this House could receive more information from the Presidency as to what is actually happening in these cases and what we can do to really increase safety in Brussels. I would like to point out to all the Members that there is an oral motion available for signature and would ask them to sign it so that something can be actively done to combat this criminal behaviour in Brussels.\n\nPresident\nThank you very much. As you will appreciate, that matter does not relate to the Minutes, nor is it a suitable subject for debate here and now. I will be very happy to inform you in writing of the steps we are already taking with the Belgian authorities to guarantee security, as far as possible, in the vicinity of the European Parliament buildings, since Brussels is a very big place.\n\nR\u00fcbig\nMr President, I refer to Friday's Minutes, where you wrote in a letter to me: ' rest assured that I share your concern and shall do my utmost", "Review of recommendation 2001/331/EC providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspection in the Member States (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Oral Question - B6-0479/2008) by Mr Ouzk\u00fd to the Commission, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the review of Recommendation 2001/331/EC providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections in the Member States.\nMiroslav Ouzk\u00fd\nauthor. - Madam President, it is difficult to stand up now after that particularly lively debate and switch to another topic!\nI would like to stress that the good and consistent enforcement of environmental legislation is essential for its credibility, for a level playing field and for ensuring that the environmental objectives will be met. The issue of environmental inspections is, therefore, very important for the work of my committee, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.\nOn 14 November the Commission published the communication on environmental inspections in the Member States. This communication reviewed Recommendation 2001/331/EC of the European Commission, providing minimum criteria for environmental inspections.\nThe communication contains some worrying messages. It states that the information submitted by the Member States on the implementation of the recommendation is incomplete or difficult to compare. It states that there are still large differences in the way environmental inspections are being carried out in the EU. It states that the scope of the recommendation is inadequate and that it does not include many important activities such as Natura 2000 and the control of illegal waste shipping. It states that inspection plans have not been implemented and where they do exist that they are often not publicly available.\nMy committee noted with concern the conclusions from the Commission stating that the full implementation of the environmental legislation in the Community cannot be ensured. This woul", "Explanations of vote\nPresident\nThe next item is the explanations of vote.\nJens Holm, Kartika Tamara Liotard and Eva-Britt Svensson  \nin writing. - We are opposing a continued expansion of the EU budget, which today is already too extensive, with a large part of the funds going to the wrong ends. Today there seem to be a reciprocal action between new objectives for the Union and demands on financing by the EU.\nThis means new demands on payments from the Member States, but also that new funds are being transferred to a system which is bureaucratic, inefficient and complex. Today there is also too large a focus on industrial agriculture and foreign policy and military projects, and not enough on the environment and social projects. However, there are many desirable initiatives being financed via the budget, and we support reasonable changes to existing means. We did choose to support the specific amendment 945, since it covers, among other things, aid to Palestine, even though there were other aspects of the amendment of which we do not approve.\nCatherine Stihler  \nin writing. - I completely oppose European funds being used to grow tobacco in the European Union. Half a million EU citizens die needlessly each year due to tobacco addiction. We cannot continue to subsidise tobacco growing in the EU.\nLars Wohlin  \nin writing. - (SV) I have chosen to vote to the fullest possible extent in favour of the Council's draft budget for 2008, and therefore against all increases in expenditure proposed by the European Parliament. It is extremely unfortunate that Parliament wishes to finance Galileo through the Community budget. If it transpires that the private operators back out owing to profitability problems, the EU should take the consequences and discontinue the project or allow interested Member States to join in, as happened with Boeing. I have also been involved in the issue of the abolition of subsidies for tobacco producers and support for wine production, and can only reg", "\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 I declare open the 2006-2007 session of the European Parliament. \n\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is the report (A6-0036/2006) by Reino Paasilinna, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on a European information society for growth and employment (2005/2167(INI)). \nReino Paasilinna (PSE ),\n\u00a0\u00a0 . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when I started drafting the report the telecommunications sector was in a rather miserable state. Most Member States had not yet even delivered their national communications on the progress they had made in implementation. The situation now is better: all the national communications are with the Commission, and in almost every Member State five directives have come into force one way or another. Meanwhile, however, many Member States have been protecting their monopolies for many years, and so they have had the money to penetrate the markets in those Member States which opened up their markets on time.\nNevertheless, these directives are already obsolete. This industry is developing at such a rate that new legislation is necessary to guarantee the viability and development of the market and its potential for providing employment. For this reason, it is good that the Commission has decided to propose the i2010 strategy, which aims to create a viable common knowledge-based area. We need to safeguard investment and appropriations for research, and all Europeans need to have access to this system, including the poor.\nTechnology changes more rapidly than legislation, and this is why I adhered to the basic premise that the strategy proposed in my report should be as transparent as possible, and that technology should be neutral. This will allow it to create incentives for access to the market for all kinds of new inventions and alternatives, and also competitors. We will change the world more with technology than with politics. But who should lead this change? We should be talking about the ubiquitous information ", "Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Locatelli, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council regulation setting up the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking - C6-0446/2007 -.\nJanez Poto\u010dnik\nMember of the Commission. - Madam President, first and foremost, I wish to express my gratitude to Parliament and particularly to the rapporteur, Pia Locatelli, and also to Teresa Riera Madurell, who will be replacing her, for supporting our proposal for setting up the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking.\nLet me also thank each of the shadow rapporteurs for their constructive support, as well as the Committee on Budgets for its opinion.\nThe Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking will have two founding members: the Industry Grouping and the Community. Private industry has established the Industry Grouping, and its members represent a major share of Europe's fuel cell and hydrogen companies, such as car manufacturers, energy providers, developers of fuel cells and developers of their applications. All sizes of companies are represented - from micro to multinationals.\nThe cooperation between the Commission and industry during the preparation of the regulation has clearly shown the strong driving force of the industry concerned. The assurance from the public side to provide stable funding on a long-term basis will provide additional confidence. As a result, we can expect a commitment of considerable additional resources from the private sector.\nIn addition to the two founding members of the Joint Undertaking, universities, research centres and other research organisations are presently establishing a Research Grouping that is expected to become the third member of the Joint Undertaking. Representation of the Research Grouping on the Joint Undertaking Governing Board was considered necessary owing to the importance of fundamental research to this Joint Technology Init", "Question Time (Council) \nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B6-0001/2008).\nThe following questions have been submitted to the Council.\nSubject: Youth Working Party\nHow does the Council intend to implement its priorities in the youth field which were presented at the Council's Youth Working Party in December 2007 and in particular the role of volunteering in this area?\nJanez Lenar\u010di\u010d\nPresident-in-Office. - (SL) With your help we will certainly succeed more easily. Regarding the answer to the question by Ms Harkin, I would firstly like to draw attention to the Council's latest initiative relating to her question. It concerns the resolution on voluntary youth activities adopted by the Council on 16 November 2007.\nThe purpose of this latest initiative is to confirm and consolidate the suitability and validity of common aims concerning voluntary youth activities which were defined back in 2004. In addition, this initiative stresses the intersectorial and transversal character of voluntary activities and the importance of encouraging companies to support such youth activities.\nIn principle, the result confirmed the guidelines for action with which the Member States should comply in invigorating the realisation of common aims in the area of voluntary youth activities. The resolution invites the Member States to choose from the above-mentioned guidelines for action, by September of this year, those on which they intend to focus particularly, and to define national strategies and concrete measures for the implementation of those guidelines.\nConsequently, the Presidency is convinced that the issue of voluntary youth activities will remain among the priority political tasks of the Council and the Parliament. We are also relying on the Member States to complete the scheduled activities pursuant to this resolution by the given deadline, i.e. by September of this year.\nMarian Harkin\nMr President, my thanks to the Slovenian Presidency for its answer. President-in-Office, I ", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 5 November 1998.\n\nApproval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of the sitting of Thursday, 5 November 1998 have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nJanssen van Raay\nI should like it to be explicitly recorded in the Minutes that I said in Brussels that it is not only for reasons of principle that I am no longer voting in roll-call votes - which I have not done for some time -, but also for taxation reasons. I repeat: Dutch taxation reasons. I should like this to be recorded.\n\nPresident\nThank you, Mr Janssen van Raay, that will be done.\n\nStriby\nMr President, I do not want to speak about the Minutes, but I would like to ask you when the new parliament will be completed. Is the IPE4, which is still a 'forbidden city', something out of a science fiction novel? We are still here today in this lovely Hemicycle, which we are, of course, attached to, since we cannot sit in the new building. We hear rumours here and we wait. When will the inaugural sitting be held? Will it be in December, February or the summer of 1999?\nWhy are there such delays? We accept the argument that the complex process of moving in must be as well organised as possible, but I sincerely hope that it not a matter once again of politicking against Strasbourg. Mr President, we expect a clear response explaining all this wavering that damages Parliament's image of rigour, efficiency and credibility.\n\nPresident\nWhat I can tell you, Mr Striby, is that the building is not yet ready for occupation. Clearly, the company which had the task of constructing of the building should have made it available to Parliament last January. Parliament is not responsible for the fact that it is still not ready, since it has not yet been certified by the relevant authorities or the architects. For our part, we are doing our utmost to cooperate with the city of Strasbourg and the French Government so that ", "21. Retail Financial Services in the Single Market (\n\u00b0\n\u00b0 \u00b0\nRomana Jordan Cizelj\n(SL) I would like to comment on the remarks made at the beginning of voting when fellow members attempted to use the unplanned event at the Kr\u0161ko nuclear power station as an illustration of the unsafe performance of nuclear power plants. I should point out that the event was indeed unplanned, that it involved a component failure, that the plant was not shut down but rather had its operations safely suspended, and that repairs on it are under way. The operation of the power station is transparent and fellow members can find information on it on the website of the country's nuclear safety administration. I should also add that by all performance indicators the Kr\u0161ko nuclear power station is one of the safest nuclear power plants in the world.\n", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session suspended on Thursday, 12 March 2009.\n\nFirst, I would like to welcome the new Secretary-General of the European Parliament, Klaus Welle, who is sitting on my left, and to wish him all the best in his endeavours.\n(Applause)\nOn my right is David Harley, the Deputy Secretary-General.

I am thinking of something that happened yesterday during a hearing concerning the Takeover Directive. The Chairman of the hearing, Mr Gargani, asked the officers to ensure that all the men put jackets on out of respect for the experts present, as he put it. Since my assistant had no jacket or tie on, he was asked to leave the hearing and was therefore unable to do his work, a fact I am very unhappy about.\nI should like to know if there is a new practice in Parliament. For your information, I can point out that I am wearing neither a tie, shirt nor jacket. As a matter of fact, I am wearing jeans, so I would ask you: do I have permission to be here as an MEP?\nPresident. -\nMr Blak, I will make inquiries into that matter. I note your upset with regard to your assistant.\nRegarding the balance, you are welcome to be here, but after the sitting I would be happy to recommend you a good tailor.\nPresident. -\nThe next item is the statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy on the situation in Iraq.\n(Members on the centre and left held up placards reading 'No to war' and 'Yes to old Europe')\n\nSolana\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, as always, it is a great honour for me to take part in a sitting of the European Parliament. But although it is always a pleasure, I must tell you that today is also a moment of great concern for me.\n(The President cut off the speaker.)\n\nPresident. -\nMr Solana, I apologise for interrupting your introduction. Colleagues, I think you have made your point. I would appreciate it if you would put down your placards so that we can proceed with the debate.\n(Applause from the right)\n\nSolana.\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, I was saying that I am always happy to appear be", "Commission Question Time\nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B6-0318/07).\nWe wanted today, and I think some colleagues are aware of this, to try a little experiment in order to make Question Time a little more friendly and interactive. I would therefore invite all Members of this House to come forward to the front row of seating so that we can be a little more friendly amongst ourselves and the Commission. Please, come forward to the front seats rather than sitting right at the back.\nI can see that some of you are still shy. Come on, it should be fun to have an experiment!\nThe following questions are addressed to the Commission.\nFirst part\n\nSubject: Child abduction\nIn the light of the number of cases of child abduction and disappearances, what measures is the Commission proposing to coordinate Member States' means of preventing and punishing these types of acts throughout the European Union?\nFranco Frattini\nVice-President of the Commission. - The Commission fully agrees on the importance of combating the disappearance and abduction of minors. Enhancing children's rights, as you all know very well, is one of my personal priorities.\nThe first action undertaken by the European Commission in relation to this was to support, in 2001, the creation of a European network of organisations, the European Federation on Missing and Sexually Exploited Children, which is now called Missing Children Europe. To date, we have 21 organisations in 15 Member States.\nThen, with the financial backing of our Community programme, the Daphne Programme, several centres were created or revamped from 2001 to 2005, with the aid of Child Focus.\nSeveral Member States have, over the last 10 years, set up emergency call lines in order to speed up searches and support families of missing children.\nCases of missing children and abduction can quickly become, and still become, cross-border phenomena. We therefore propose to have a single telephone number for urgent calls about missing children.

We have a comprehensive agenda, which includes many issues that affect the welfare of us all. We will be discussing the issues of combating climate change, finding ways to lead the EU out of the financial and economic crisis, promoting energy security and dealing with the problem of illegal migration.\nThe European Union will be best prepared to tackle all of these issues if we have clarity on the issue of the Treaty. It is important for the Treaty of Lisbon to enter into force as soon as possible so that, among other things, we can continue the work of appointing the new Commission. That is why the European Council will also look at these issues.\nI will begin with the issues in which I know there is a strong interest in the European Parliament. At the end of next week, the Heads of State or Government will attempt to obtain clarity on the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon and how the process will proceed. The overwhelming 'yes' vote in Ireland and the signature of the Polish President have given the work renewed vigour, but, as you all know, the Treaty cannot enter into force until all of the Member States have ratified it - 26 of the 27 have done so, but we are still waiting for the Czech Republic. The country's lower house and Senate approved the Treaty, but then 17 senators petitioned the Czech constitutional court to examine whether the Treaty of Lisbon is compatible with the Czech constitution.\nWe must, of course, respect the democratic process in the Czech Republic. On 27 October, in other words next week, the country's constitutional court will hold a public hearing on this matter. We believe that the court will give its ruling very shortly afterwards, but we still do not have a date for ", "Opening of the sitting\n(The sitting was opened at 10 a.m.)\nBernd Posselt\n(DE) Madam President, just very briefly: some of our colleagues may not be aware of this yet, but it was mentioned to me that yesterday, it was decided that the next part-session will be held in Brussels. I have heard that there are tremendous problems getting beds here in Brussels as the hotel rooms are booked out due to a trade fair. This part-session should simply have been postponed or transformed into a mini-part-session. That would have been the best solution. With a measure of good will, that could have been done.\nThe second point which I would briefly like to make is directly related to this: has the safety situation actually been checked here in this building? I hear that there are major structural defects here. Has this building been checked using the same criteria as have now been applied in the Strasbourg building?\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, let us not start a debate on this topic now. Announcements will be made this afternoon at voting time.\nAll the appropriate steps are being taken to check the buildings on a preventive basis and to make the appropriate repairs at Strasbourg so that we can return there as soon as possible for our work.\nWe shall not return until we are sure that it is safe.\nPhilip Bushill-Matthews\nMadam President, I shall be brief, as I accept you do not want a debate. If there is to be an announcement at 12 o'clock, could that announcement also state whether the Bureau is considering - and I am not trying to be provocative - having a longer period of being in Brussels, so that we can have decisions in due time in order to get hotels and meeting rooms? Because these constant one-by-one decisions are not making life easy for any of us. Practically, could that be considered, and could we have a comment back in the announcement at 12 o'clock, please?\nPresident\nMr Bushill-Matthews, it is not Parliament's practice to change the sitting from Brussels to Strasbourg f", "Opening of the sitting: see Minutes\n\nIgnasi Guardans Cambo\nMr President, I would like to raise a point of order under Rule 166 concerning Annex II(A) of the Rules of Procedure of this House.\nI tabled an oral question to the Commission which was supposed to be answered today and I have received a formal answer from the Presidency saying that my question was not acceptable, apparently in application of Annex II(A) of the Rules of Procedure, which says that a question cannot be admissible if it has been answered in the previous three months. But no such question has been answered in the previous three months. Apparently this provision is being applied with regard to a reply given by the Commission to an oral question with debate.\nWell, Annex II, which is quoted by the Presidency, applies to questions by MEPs regulated by Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure, and the oral question with debate is regulated by Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure. So, since Annex II is a restriction of the rights of a Member of Parliament, an extensive interpretation could not be allowed to apply Annex II to questions in Rule 108 instead of Rule 109. So, I would ask the Presidency to reconsider and to allow the question to be tabled in application of the Rules of Procedure.\nPresident\nWe will look into it and inform you accordingly.\n", "Resumption of the sitting\nMaij-Weggen\nMr President, I do not want to comment on yesterday' s Minutes, but would like to make an observation of a different kind; so I hope you will allow me to do that first. Indeed, I understand - and I am speaking as the coordinator for my group for the ACP Meeting - that none of the Commissioners will be attending the ACP-EU Meeting in Cape Town in four weeks' time. Not one single Commissioner, not Mr Nielson, nor Mr Patten, nor Mr Lamy, nor Mr Fischler, for that matter. In order to avoid a huge disgrace, you could perhaps make an urgent appeal to the European Commission to ensure that a Commissioner attends this Meeting, for an entire programme of questions in writing and such like are on the agenda there. It is also a disgrace in respect of the 70 developing countries that the Commission is not making an effort to attend the ACP Meeting. This would be the first time that this has happened, and I have been attending ACP meetings for years. Hence my urgent request that an appeal be made to the European Commission.\n\nPresident\nI will take it up with the Commission, Mrs Maij-Weggen, and when we have the response we can come back to the House.\n\nStatement by the President of the European Parliament\nPresident\nWe come to the next item of business - and here I would like to thank the Conference of Presidents and colleagues in the House for taking a short policy statement from myself, followed by a debate, to talk a little bit about the next two and a half years of the presidency.\nWhen I spoke after my election on 15 January I said I would like to claim the privilege which is a common privilege of the newly elected President to address the House on our strategic purpose for the coming period. In deciding to speak today it was in deference to the fact that on the Wednesday of that part-session the Spanish Prime Minister was here to launch the Spanish presidency. One thing I want to bring to this House - and I hope we will all work on this to", "Illegal immigration, external action of the European Union and Frontex (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on illegal immigration, external action of the European Union and Frontex.\nJanez Lenar\u010di\u010d\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (SL) By way of introduction I would like to emphasise that the challenge of immigration requires a comprehensive approach. The European Union must develop an effective migration policy and legislation and at the same time continue its efforts to combat illegal immigration. We need measures at European Union level as well as at the level of the Member States and we need the cooperation of third countries. One of the most important aspects of the struggle against illegal immigration is effective control of the European Union's external borders.\nA great achievement in this field is without doubt the recent inclusion of nine Member States in the Schengen area. Following their entry into the Schengen area, the Slovenian Presidency started work on the introduction of the second generation Schengen information system, known as SIS II, as soon as possible. This is one of the European Union's priority projects at the present time. All the necessary activities should be carried out in a way that would facilitate completion of the transition from the first generation of the Schengen information system to the second generation by September 2009 at the latest.\nBecause of frequent incidents in the Mediterranean Sea and on the North African coast, the Commission and some Member States proposed some initiatives, in 2007, for improving the management of illegal immigration. As part of those efforts, in March of this year the Slovenian Presidency hosted a conference at Ministerial level on the future challenges for management of the European Union's external borders. The three reports presented by the Commission in February were debated for the first time at the conference. The participants at the confer", "Situation in Yemen (debate) \nPresident\nThe sitting is resumed.\nThe next item is the statement by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the Commission on the situation in Yemen.\nCatherine Ashton\nHigh Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, we know the reason why Yemen is on our agenda today. We traced the Detroit bomber's trail from the United States to Europe, to Africa and Yemen. Thus, we were reminded, once again, that our own security is at risk if we do not help countries like Yemen, who are struggling to meet multiple challenges at the same time.\nTerrorism is the immediate focus but is only one of an interlinked set of challenges. There is instability in the north, fuelled by armed conflict with the Houthi rebels. There is conflict over land and water rights and longstanding tensions with the southern region, which has felt marginalised since unification in 1991. The government has so far been able to maintain overall stability but, as oil revenues have dwindled, the state is struggling to maintain control over parts of the national territory.\nTo this we can add piracy in the Gulf of Aden, smuggling, migration and people-trafficking from the Horn of Africa and, now, a rise in jihadist terrorism. Yemen has substantial population growth and an increasingly discontented young population. An inclusive internal political consensus on the way forward remains elusive.\nAmidst all this, one thing is clear: none of us can afford a zone of near-lawlessness stretching from the Horn of Africa to Afghanistan. We would pay the price ourselves.\nOver the last 18 months, the European Union has highlighted Yemen as a priority case in its counter-terrorism strategy and its comprehensive approach to state-building and development. The Council adopted extensive conclusions on Yemen in October. We are now seeking to rally all our key players around", "Legislative process on the 3rd Energy Package (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council on the continuation and timely conclusion of the legislative process on the 3rd Energy Package by Hannes Swoboda, Reino Paasilinna, Eluned Morgan, Atanas Paparizov, Giles Chichester, Alejo Vidal-Quadras, Herbert Reul, Angelika Niebler, Gunnar H\u00f6kmark and Jerzy Buzek, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats - B6-0493/2008).\nAtanas Paparizov\nauthor. - Mr President, on 18 June and 9 July 2008, the European Parliament adopted at first reading the legislative resolutions on the directives and regulations of the third Energy Package. The package is of major importance for the creation of a European internal market in electricity and gas and for ensuring a transparent and clear regulatory framework for investments in transmission networks and enhancing regional and pan-European cooperation. On that basis, the energy package contributes greatly to the EU Member States' security of energy supply.\nIts adoption will also be a major contribution to the efforts to implement the ambitious legislative package on energy and climate change, which I am confident Parliament will adopt tomorrow.\nIn this respect, we would like to request that the French presidency inform us of its intention to present to the European Parliament the common position of the Council on the five legislative proposals. We would also appreciate detailed information on what steps the Council, and in particular the Czech presidency, envisages for the continuation and timely conclusion of the legislative process on the third Energy Package.\nThe European Parliament has repeatedly demonstrated its willingness to engage in a constructive dialogue with the Council. As a token of this readiness, the European Parliament rapporteurs initiated a letter addressed to Minister Borloo o", "Signature of acts adopted under codecision: see Minutes\nMarco Cappato\n(IT) Mr President, Rule 28 of our Rules of Procedure provides that questions related to the work of the Bureau shall receive a reply within 30 days of being submitted.\nAbout three months ago, on 28 March, I submitted a question on the statements made, in the presence of the President of our Parliament, by Cardinal Angelo Scola, who said that it was not appropriate for the current European Parliament to make continual pronouncements on issues such as marriage, family and life. In the face of such an attack on this Parliament I decided to submit the question I have mentioned, and I think it is important for Parliament's Bureau to defend this House and its deliberations against attacks by a foreign State such as the Vatican City State.\nPresident\nMr Cappato, if what you say is true - and I do not doubt that it is - you must, of course, be given an answer. The capable ladies and gentlemen next to me will look into the matter and then you will get an answer.\n", "2. European Globalisation Adjustment Fund: ES/Region of Valencia (\n- Before the vote:\nBarbara Matera\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the current context of economic crisis, one of the biggest problems that advanced economies are having to face is precisely that of unemployment, a threat that has reached the alarming level of 10% of the euro area.\nThe European institutions and, above all, the European Commission, in its draft budget for 2011, have introduced a series of measures to support the economic recovery, including supplementing the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, for which I am rapporteur, and which is being called upon for four important mobilisation requests, on which we are about to vote.\nI therefore believe that the procedures for mobilising this fund should be streamlined, in order to respond quickly to workers whose companies have been hit by the economic crisis and who have been affected by their companies' relocation processes. I therefore urge my fellow Members to promote this fund within the individual Member States.\n", "Educating the children of migrants (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is a short presentation of the report by Mr Takkula, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on educating the children of migrants.\nHannu Takkula\nrapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, it is the ethical obligation of the European Union to ensure that everyone, including the children of migrants, has the right to a good education. Each child must have the right to receive an education, which must be free and compulsory, at least at basic level. Children should be able to receive a general education that fosters equal opportunities to develop their abilities - their individual power of discernment and sense of moral and social responsibility - so that they might grow as well-balanced, responsible members of society.\nThose responsible for the education and supervision of children should regard what is best for the child as their guiding principle. This of course starts in the home and with the parents, but schools and society also need to be in a supporting role in children's upbringing, thereby allowing pupils to develop their personalities more wholly.\nI have been concerned about the studies that have been recently published on the children of migrants. They suggest that in some places it has been very difficult for them to go to school and that in some societies efforts have been made to establish schools that cater exclusively for the children of migrants. The result has been, of course, that families have moved their children from the local school so that they would not need to be in the same school as the children of migrants. This is a regrettable situation and has led to very poor educational standards and school results among the children of migrants. Another outcome has been the very fast turnover of teaching staff in those schools with a high concentration of migrant children.\nThis is not the development we had hoped for, and we must establish conditions where the childre", "Southern Neighbourhood, and Libya in particular, including humanitarian aspects (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the Southern Neighbourhood, and Libya in particular, including humanitarian aspects.\nAs you know, the situation in North Africa is a crucial test for the European Union. Now that the European External Action Service is operating, we have new tools for working outside the borders of the Union. We are persuaded, of course, that these activities are fully justified, both with respect to Tunisia and Egypt as well as Libya. Today, we are going to talk mainly about Libya, but not only about Libya. We also have a duty to our citizens, who expect us to present an action plan for the Southern Neighbourhood, a programme for cooperation and support for the short, medium and long term. We have to think about this now. Also present in the European Parliament today are representatives of the Transitional National Council of Libya. This means we have a great opportunity to make direct contact and talk with the Libyan opposition. We have to start by overcoming the humanitarian crisis.\nMadam Vice-President/High Representative, we are convinced that all the activities of the European Union as a whole would be very supportive of the southern part of our continent and of our neighbours on the opposite side of the Mediterranean Sea.\nCatherine Ashton\nVice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, honourable Members, thank you for the opportunity to discuss with this House the circumstances in our Southern Neighbourhood and, of course, with particular reference, as the President has said, to the situation in Libya.\nLet me begin by stating the obvious which is that the Southern Neighbourhood is changing fast and across the region, people are standing up for that core h", "13. The fight against terrorism (vote) \n- Motion for resolution\n- Before the vote on Amendment 3:\nClaudio Fava\n(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the oral amendment that our Group is proposing involves replacing the words 'all forms of glorifying' by the word 'apology'. We consider that the word apology better reflects the type of behaviour to be curbed. If Mr D\u00edaz de Mera is in agreement, our Group will vote in favour.\n(The oral amendment was accepted)\n- Before the vote on Amendment 27:\nCristiana Muscardini\n(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on the basis of Rule 151(3), you, as President, can decide on the admissibility of paragraph 6, on which we are about to vote. That recital states that terrorism can no longer be eradicated. Can this House really make it official that terrorism cannot be eradicated? I feel that there must either be a translation error in some texts, or a very serious political misjudgement, and for those reasons I ask you, Madam President, to decide on the admissibility of that paragraph.\nPresident\nMs Muscardini, all the admissibility checks have been done by the services, and it was open to amendments, so I am afraid we are where we are now.\n- Before the vote on Amendment 33:\nClaudio Fava\n(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I ask whether the proposer of the amendment would agree to remove the two phrases which currently read: 'in some rare instances' and 'which may not be lawful' from the sentence. If these two phrases are removed from the amendment, we would be willing to support it.\n(The oral amendment was accepted)\n", "2. Situation of Burmese refugees in Thailand (vote) \nBefore the vote on paragraph 2:\nCharles Tannock\nauthor. - Madam President, I notice once again that the officials have not actually written the oral amendments in the same order as they are actually voted on, so I will be very careful to pick the right order myself this time. For paragraph 2, we want to add the words at the end of the paragraph, 'as well as deliberate impoverishment, arbitrary taxation and land confiscation'.\nCharles Tannock\nauthor. - Madam President, amended orally as follows for paragraph 5: 'Welcomes the Thai Government's cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and calls for immediate and full access to all the detained Rohingya boat people in order to define their protection needs; calls, at the same time, on the Government of Thailand to sign the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol thereto;'.\nCharles Tannock\nauthor. - Madam President, I will read out the entire text for paragraph 6 as amended orally: 'Stresses that the boat people issue which affects Thailand and other countries is essentially a regional one; views positively the efforts of the Thai Government to increase cooperation among regional neighbours to address the Rohingya issue; welcomes in this respect the meeting held on 23 January by the Permanent Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Kasit Piromya, with the Ambassadors of India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Malaysia and Burma; and appeals to the members of ASEAN and, in particular, the Thai chair and relevant international organisations, to work on a permanent solution to this long-standing problem;'.\nCharles Tannock\nauthor. - Madam President, recital E should read as follows: 'whereas the United Nations refugee agency has voiced its concern about the reports of mistreatment of the Burmese refugees and gained access to some of the 126 Rohingya still kept in custody by the Thai authorities'.\n", "7. The particular situation of women in prison and the impact of the imprisonment of parents on social and family life (\n- Before the vote:\nTeresa Riera Madurell\n(ES) Madam President, before we begin the vote on this report I must say that along with the rapporteur, Mrs Panayotopoulos, and the other rapporteurs, I have an oral amendment to propose regarding the first amendment to paragraph 6.\nIt is to remove the last two words of the amendment, I shall say them in English: (EN) 'contraception and abortion'; (ES) this would obviate the need for voting on the second part of the amendment in question.\n(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)\n- Before the vote on Amendment 7:\nMarie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou\nMadam President, this is about a change in the phrase 'detention of girls and boys'; and the age is changed too, to 18 instead of 17.\n(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)\n", "Missing persons in Cyprus (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on missing persons in Cyprus.\nIn this respect, I should like to welcome the members of the United Nations Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus, who are present in the official gallery to follow the debate on this issue and, more specifically, Christophe Girod, Chairman of the UN Committee, Elias Georgiadis, a Greek-Cypriot member of the Committee and G\u00fclden Pl\u00fcmer K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck, a Turkish-Cypriot member of the same Committee.\n(Applause)\nPeter Mandelson\nMember of the Commission. Mr President, the Commission welcomes and supports the motion for a resolution on the Committee on Missing Persons. Like the honourable Members of this House, we believe that relatives have a fundamental right to know what became of missing persons. Since the unrest of the 1960s and 1970s, about 1500 Greek Cypriots and 500 Turkish Cypriots have been missing, presumed dead.\nThe Committee on Missing Persons is charged with finding and identifying the remains of the missing, of returning them to their families and of counselling the bereaved. The Committee has the support of both sides on the island and of the international community. It is currently the most important and successful bi-communal confidence-building and reconciliation measure in Cyprus. Recent exhumations and the establishment of an anthropological laboratory in the buffer zone show that, if there is a political will on the side of both communities, much can be achieved.\nThe Committee on Missing Persons can count not only on the Commission's political support but also on the financial support of the European Union. Under the aid programme for the Turkish Cypriot community, EUR 1.5 million has been earmarked. This should come on stream shortly in line with the Committee's needs, and I hope that the work of the Committee will help prepare the ground for the overall solution of the long-lasting conflict in Cyprus.\nI take this opportunity to recall that", "13. Draft amending budget No 6/2007 (vote) \n- Report: Elles\nBenita Ferrero-Waldner\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to make a statement on behalf of the Commission. In its preliminary draft amending budget 6/2007, the Commission proposed the creation of a new budget item - 'Damage requests resulting from legal procedures against the Commission's decisions in the field of competition' and the classification of the related expenditure under Heading 1a of the multiannual financial framework as it refers to an operational activity in the competition policy area.\nThe Commission would charge against this budget item possible budgetary implications stemming from rulings of the Court of Justice or the Court of First Instance in the field of competition. The need for this budget item derives from recent judgments of the Court of First Instance and from the structure of the budget. While fines in the field of competition policy are entered as general budget revenue, the amounts to be paid require the creation of a budget item in the expenditure side of the budget, which does not exist at the moment.\nThe Commission takes note that the budgetary authority does not intend to support the creation of this budget item for the year 2007. Despite this decision, if necessary the Commission may have to proceed to payments in order to meet legal obligations that might result from the Court's decisions in 2007 within the limits of the current budget and in application of the relevant rules.\nIt does not prejudge the final decision on the creation of the dedicated budget line and on the classification of the related expenditure within the multiannual financial framework.\n", "4. Implementation of the synergies of research and innovation earmarked funds in Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 concerning the European Fund of Regional Development and the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development (\n- Before the vote:\nLambert van Nistelrooij\nThere are no problems with this report. On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to request an electronic vote.\nPresident\nThe time has actually run out, but, in the light of the limited transport options available this week and provided that the House has no objections, I propose that we hold a roll-call vote. Does anyone wish to object? No one has objected, so we can vote.\n", "Standards of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation - Action plan on organ donation and transplantation (2009-2015) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on:\nthe report by Mr Mikol\u00e1\u0161ik, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on standards of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation - C6-0480/2008 -, and\nthe report by Mr Perello Rodriguez, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Commission Communication: Action plan on Organ Donation and Transplantation (2009-2015): Strengthened Cooperation between Member States.\nMiroslav Mikol\u00e1\u0161ik\nI am delighted to have this unique opportunity to appear before you today and to talk about the progress we have achieved in the negotiations in Parliament, and also in the subsequent trialogue on this very important topic of organ donations and transplants.\nI personally consider this bill to be enormously important, not only as the chief rapporteur, but also as a doctor. I firmly believe that this new directive fundamentally addresses the greatest challenge we currently face in the process of organ donations and transplants, which is the shortage of organs faced by patients who are waiting for them.\nIn the context of providing the best health protection for European Union citizens, our goal is to ensure that human organs designated for transplantation are safe and of a high quality.\nThe Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety voted on the draft report on 16 March, when it was adopted by a clear majority in the context of the rapporteur's recommendations. Subsequently, we completed three intensive interinstitutional trialogues involving Parliament, the Commission and the Council, under the leadership of the Spanish Presidency.\nI would especially like to highlight the following points, which were key", "Prevention of natural and man-made disasters (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Jo\u00e3o Ferreira, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Commission communication: A Community approach on the prevention of natural and man-made disasters -.\nJo\u00e3o Ferreira\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, several times over the last year, headlines and news slots have been filled with storms, floods, heat waves, fires and other disasters, with serious consequences for the public, the land, the economy and the environment.\nYet this was not the only year when this has happened. Over the first six years of the EU Solidarity Fund, the Commission received 62 requests for financial support from 21 different countries. Of these, approximately one third come under the category of major disasters. Other disasters did not result in requests to deploy the fund, although they had considerable and, in many cases, long-lasting, impacts on the affected populations, the environment and the economy.\nDisasters are deeply unfair. They almost always have the greatest effect on those who are least able to protect themselves, be they people or states. For this reason, the report states that a Community approach towards disaster prevention should have as its central concern a reduction in the current disparities between regions and Member States in this matter, especially helping to improve prevention in regions and Member States with a high risk exposure and low economic capacity.\nNatural disasters and, by extension, man-made disasters, can and should be prevented.\nOften, disasters are compounded by policies that create an unequal relationship between mankind and the surrounding environment.\nThis report recognises that some of the EU's sectoral policies, such as the common agricultural policy, to take an example, have contributed to increased risk exposure for certain regions and their inhabitants, in this case, by encour", "The Commission's 2007 enlargement strategy paper (continuation of debate) \nPresident\nWe will now continue our debate on the Commission's 2007 enlargement strategy paper.\nJean-Pierre Jouyet\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, I should like to make three comments before I turn to this debate, which has been extremely productive and exciting.\nFirst, on behalf of the Council, I would like to welcome the South African delegation who are here with us, and to tell them that we shall be seeing their country's leaders very soon, as that will be the first European Union summit that will take place in France, at the end of July.\nSecondly, I should like to join Mr Rehn in expressing great sympathy for the German tourists who, according to a dispatch, have been kidnapped by Kurdish rebels in Turkey. We in the Council very much hope that, if this is confirmed, these people will be found safe and sound as quickly as possible, and we would stress that our thoughts are with them.\nThirdly, I want to thank Mr Duff for his knowledge of French politics, and of the positions I personally hold. I shall, of course, be happy to talk to him in greater depth over a coffee, but unfortunately my duties today do not allow me to comment on them now.\nTo move on to our debate, enlargement is definitely part of the story of European development, and to date we have always ensured that enlargement and strengthening of the Union go hand in hand. It is important that this should continue, as Mr Brok emphasised. All debates are helpful in making our citizens aware of the issues involved in enlargement, and so we pay particular attention to the European Parliament's debates and positions on this topic.\nFollowing on from what many Members have said, I wish to emphasise the stabilising role of enlargement. This is obvious in the case of the Balkans. The rapid progress made by Croatia, which the French Presidency wishes to expedite further if all the Member States agree, shows that coun", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nEvans, Robert\nI wonder if you are able to confirm, or your services are able to confirm, that this building, particularly the Tower Building, satisfies all aspects of health and safety legislation and whether it has a valid fire certificate. These are important issues and if it does not, then I think serious questions must be raised. I would therefore ask you either to confirm this categorically or, if not, to confirm that measures are taken to investigate the situation.\n\nPresident\nMr Evans, we have followed the building regulations and taken them into serious consideration during this time at the Presidency office, and I believe that your concerns received due attention. I will, however, pass on your comments to the President and they will be discussed at the Presidency office, so that all possible clarification may be given to the Assembly on this matter.\n\nEvans, Robert\nMr President, do I understand it that you are therefore not able to confirm what I asked? You are not confirming that the building satisfies health and safety and fire regulations? You said you will look at it and try to clarify the situation. What I am asking is: are you able to categorically confirm that the building satisfies these regulations, yes or no?\n\nPresident\nMr Evans, my opinion is that the building complies with all the specifications laid down by law, but at this precise moment, I am unable to give you a guarantee of this because I do not have the relevant information to hand, and I therefore reserve the right to pass on your intervention to the President.\nThe Minutes were approved\n\nDioxin\nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on the contamination by dioxins of certain products intended for human or animal consumption.\n\nHemil\u00e4\nCouncil.

What prompted the European Union to set up a Temporary Committee on Climate Change? It was the right approach, to present an overall view of how we, the European Union, intend to deal with this issue. If we want to help at international level to ensure that this issue is kept on the agenda - as Stavros Dimas is successfully doing for the Commission - as the European Union, as the Parliament, we must state what our concept is; in other words, we need to state what our visiting card is on this issue. Ultimately, Europe must show how we are dealing with this issue, and what approach we are adopting in order to encourage other countries and continents to move with us in the same direction. That is why it is important to begin with the scientific aspect of this debate, and that is what we are talking about today.\nFocusing on this aspect will never produce an attractive report because it simply deals with the status quo. It is not a matter of horse-trading: giving a bit here, taking a bit there. It is about focusing on the facts. We have brought together these facts in numerous thematic strategies, during which we invited two Nobel Prize laureates to Brussels and Strasbourg. Mr President, you organised an excellent event and delivered a very significant speech on climate change, which was extremely gratifying from my perspective and which encouraged me to redouble my efforts.\nWe have heard the views of numerous experts from international bodies all over the world, under the excellent chairmanship of my good friend Guido Sacconi who managed matters very well. We were also able to invite some critics, altho", "\nDoyle\nMadam President, I should like to ask you to protest vehemently on behalf of all of us at the savage and brutal public execution on Tuesday of a mother of seven children by the Taliban regime in Kabul. I will say no more, but I am disgusted - we must all be disgusted - at this savagery.\nPlease protest on behalf of all of us.\n(Loud applause)\n\nPresident\nMrs Doyle, I read this report myself and I must tell you I was outraged and shocked. I believe your applause is a clear indication of the fact that we are all in agreement that I should announce the indignation of this House to Afghanistan.\n\nAdoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nKauppi\nMadame President, I have a problem with yesterday' s Minutes. They refer to me as 'Mr' . I gave an explanation of vote on Avil\u00e9s Perea' s report on the Daphne programme, I am referred to in the Minutes as 'Herr' Kauppi, and I would prefer it to read 'Madame' .\n\nPresident\nWell, I am quite dismayed at all these errors, which are obviously technical errors. All the same, they are not acceptable, and we shall straighten all this out.\n\nDell' Alba\nMadam President, on page 20 of the Minutes, it is announced that I spoke in support of Mr Dupuis. Well, we are colleagues, and often agree, but that is not the point. Both Mr Dupuis' speech and my own were intended to challenge the request made by the chair, Mr Bar\u00f3n Crespo, regarding the application of Rule 112. Hence the request I made was addressed to the chair so that its validity could be evaluated and we could be told this morning what the state of affairs was.\n\nPresident\nVery well, Mr Dell' Alba. That is what I am here for.\n\nCorbett\nMadam President, yesterday's Minutes in the English also seem to indicate that they were the Minutes of Thursday 17 December. I am sure that Parliament would not be writing today's Minutes before we have actually had our debates and votes.

We have asked the Commission to do so itself, but it has still not acted, and we have therefore tabled a motion of censure because that is the only means at our disposal. We have done so not because we want a head on a plate, but because we quite simply wish to attribute responsibility for the affair. Nothing more nor less.\nThe Bureau now has 67 signatures. Two more have just been submitted and, since yesterday, there have been more than 63 verified signatures. Since yesterday evening, the Bureau therefore owes it to us to give official notice that a motion of censure has been tabled, and this must therefore be scheduled for debate within 24 hours.\nI should be dreadfully annoyed if the date were to be put back, because that would lead to our having the vote during the May part-session, which should be a time for celebrating the accession of the new Member States. It is not our wish to hold the vote at that time. We are very sorry that the services have delayed this matter, and we insist that the President now give notice that it is on the agenda. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Mr Bonde, I wish to inform you that the services of Parliament are currently verifying the signatures, because, as you know, in the process of sending the signatures, some were added and others withdrawn.

The motion will be presented on behalf of the ALDE Group by Sylvie Goulard. You have the floor.\nSylvie Goulard\nMr President, as a matter of courtesy, I would ask that Commissioner Rehn be allowed to sit in on the debate on European environmental economic accounts and then on the debate on the IMF. They are not political debates.

Therefore I propose under Rule 155 to add '[18 months after the date of publication]' as the date for transposition. This should be specified.

I also stated that this is of major importance, especially in the light of Mr Bush' s visit to Europe this week. These two elements, the clash between the two value systems, and the position of President Bush and his visit to Europe this week, are not mentioned in the Minutes in this connection.

Yesterday evening, at the start of the discussion on the Rothley report on the Members' Statute, I tabled a preliminary question pursuant to Rule 128. Under this Rule, the President should have asked if there was a speaker in favour and a speaker against the motion, before putting it to the vote. No doubt mistakenly advised, the President of the sitting decided of his own accord - as is stated in the Minutes - that the report I contested was perfectly admissible.\nI should like you to use this incident, which I consider to be very serious simply because it calls into question the rights of Members and the application of the Rules of Procedure, as an opportunity to give instructions, both to those who substitute for you as President of the sitting and to all the advisers, that the Rules of Procedure are to be applied and that the rights of the majority should not take precedence over the legal position of minorities.\nThe interpretation given was clearly mistaken and I should like you to formally confirm this today.\n\nGuti\u00e9rrez D\u00edaz\nMr President, yesterday, pursuant to the Rules of Procedure, as Mr Fabre-Aubrespy has just explained, he questioned the admissibility of Mr Rothley's report.

I am sure that the Spanish Presidency's need for discussion is about to come to an end. Where we had bulk data transfer in SWIFT, we now have a bulk gathering in Parliament. Well, let it be so.\nIn February, we sent a very clear signal as Parliament that the Treaty of Lisbon not only gives us more opportunities, but also, and above all, more responsibility as the European Parliament. We govern with, and together with, the Commission and the Council at European level. The Commission has been requested to present us with an improved agreement and to enter into negotiations once again, and the mandate for these negotiations has been confirmed by the European Parliament. Given all the differences that might exist between the groups and, above all, the different points of emphasis, I believe it would not be honourable to deny that the Commission has made some genuine progress. That is something that we must give it a great deal of credit for, especially in the context of the arrangement within which it has been working and of the opportunities that were open to it.\nAt the same time, however, it emerged during the subsequent negotiations that the word 'impossible' was used a great deal. It was impossible to alter certain things, or to reopen the agreement. It was impossible to demand concessions from the ", "Cooperation in vocational education and training to support the Europe 2020 strategy (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Hirsch, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on European cooperation in vocational education and training to support the Europe 2020 strategy.\nNadja Hirsch\nMr President, Commissioner, tomorrow, we will vote on the role of vocational education and training in the Europe 2020 strategy. In this connection, it is worth taking a brief look at the position we are starting from. We currently have a level of youth unemployment of 21%, in other words, almost double the normal average. We have an EU-wide school drop-out rate of over 14%. The participation of women in gainful employment is still very low. Many people with disabilities, as well as migrants, are without jobs.\nThe goal of the Europe 2020 strategy is precisely to tap this potential in terms of workers and to bring them into the workplace so that the EU, too, can deal with globalisation. Thus, it is also our job to ensure that initial vocational education in particular is of high quality. The discussion began in connection with the Copenhagen process, followed by the Bruges Communiqu\u00e9, and now it is up to us to see to what extent this area can also be incorporated into the Europe 2020 strategy.\nAn absolutely key element is the fact that young people must have the opportunity, not only in their studies, but also in their vocational training, to undertake part of their training in another EU Member State. It is a key element because someone who has already worked in another Member State will also take the opportunity later on to regard the European labour market as his or her labour market, with all the opportunities that that offers. It is therefore an absolutely key aspect that we must pursue.\nThe second major area is, of course, that of further training. On account of demographic change, people are having to work for longer and longer - or t", "Nuclear test by the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Statements by the European Union's High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Commission on the nuclear test by North Korea.\nJavier Solana\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, you have asked me here this afternoon, together with the Commission, to give a brief assessment of what happened early on Monday morning, when the North Korean Government may have carried out a nuclear test.\nI say that it was very probably a nuclear test, as we cannot, from the information available to us at present, be completely certain that it was indeed that. The most likely explanation is that a nuclear device made from plutonium was detonated, plutonium no doubt coming from the Yongbyon nuclear reactor constructed in North Korea in the 1980s and 1990s. In all probability, it was a nuclear test and was therefore an act which we condemn, which we condemn in the strongest terms and which we also condemn because of the degree of irresponsibility it shows on the North Korean Government's part.\nThat nuclear test is not just a threat to the region around North Korea but also an act of aggression against stability and security across the world. It is not inconceivable that such an act may have implications for the global arms race generally.\nI would like to begin by saying that countries in the area have reacted calmly and responsibly. I have had an opportunity, over the last 48 hours, to talk to all countries involved in the region: to South Korea, to China and to Japan. I have also talked to Russia and the United States of America. All countries have shown the same firmness in response as we Europeans are showing, but also the same calmness, lest the situation get out of hand.\nI would like to point out very clearly that this reprehensible act came just a few days after the election as Japanese Prime Minister of Shinzo Abe, who immediately upon taking office, in a ", "EU tomato imports from Morocco (Petition 1565/2009) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on EU tomato imports from Morocco (Petition 1565/2009 by Jos\u00e9 Maria Pozancos (Spanish)), by Erminia Mazzoni, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions - B7-0211/2011).\nErminia Mazzoni\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, the question we submitted as the Committee on Petitions shows that our Committee was not satisfied with the answer that the Commission gave to the issue raised by the Spanish Federation of Associations of Producers and Exporters of Fruits, Vegetables, Flowers and Live Plants.\nIn fact, the Commission focused its attention on the responsibility of Member States in setting prices, without considering the specific point made by the petition, which was to report irregular imports of tomatoes and other vegetables from Morocco.\nThese alleged irregularities have, in fact, already been noted for some years by the regulatory body OLAF, which has pointed to the abusive application of the method for deduction provided for by Regulation (EC) No 3223/1994, which establishes three different methods of calculation. The consequences of this situation are lower revenues for the European Union, unfair competition and breach of market rules, as well as the gradual impoverishment of European producers and exporters, with seriously alarming situations reported, in particular, in Spain, Greece, Portugal, France and Italy.\nThe Commission is negotiating a new bilateral agreement with Morocco, and once again this agreement seems to not be taking these alarming facts into consideration, but to be continuing along the path towards implementation of a flow of exports from Morocco to the European Union which is totally unregulated and does not comply with European law.\nI think this is a subject we should focus on. It is a subject which relates to and touches on a currently sensitive nerve, which is that of migration flows. In fact, this great ma", "Voting time\nPresident\nBefore we start the vote, I should like to inform Members that we are today introducing a new information system for the votes in the Chamber. The main feature is the display, on one of the large screens, of the official voting list prepared by the Tabling Desk. The display will highlight each single vote as it is announced, thereby making it easier for all Members to follow the vote.\nThe next item is the vote.\n(For the results and other details on the vote: see minutes)\nGraham Watson\non behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I seek clarification. Is it the case that the President has ruled that we will apply the recast procedure to the vote on the Krahmer report today and the vote on the Cashman report tomorrow? If that is the case, my group requests that we delay the vote on the Krahmer report until tomorrow, so that we can investigate the implications of the application of the recast procedure to that vote.\nPresident\nThe President is considering these two points. When we get to the Krahmer report, we will take your procedural motion.\nThomas Mann\n(DE) Mr President, I congratulate the House on this new information system. It would seem, though, that a couple of bits of information in the everyday routine do not work.\nI am very pleased, meanwhile, that, on the 50th anniversary of China's occupation of Tibet, many of us have managed to display Tibetan flags. It has come to my attention, however, that the Bureau had said in advance that certain flags may not be put up, meaning that MEPs are unable to display them on this important day. Is there any up-to-date information on this issue?\nPresident\nI understand that there has been some confusion about this point, but the President has said that for the sake of good order today - and I am pleased to see so many flags in the Chamber; I am actually wearing one in my pocket here - the Tibetan flag may be displayed.\nThis gives me the opportunity to welcome to the Chamber Mr Tashi Wangdi, the represent", "Stress tests of nuclear power plants in EU and nuclear safety in EU neighbourhood countries (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on stress tests of nuclear power plants in EU and nuclear safety in EU neighbouring countries.\nG\u00fcnther Oettinger\nMember of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, honourable Members, following numerous meetings with various parliamentary committees, I can report to you today on the progress of our ambitious plan to introduce a Europe-wide stress test for nuclear power stations in the European Union and in other countries.\nWe proposed to the Council that the safety of all the nuclear power stations in the EU should be investigated on the basis of a comprehensive risk and safety evaluation and the Council reached a decision on this at the end of March. The European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group (ENSREG) and the Commission were asked to draw up the criteria, the methodology and the timeframe for carrying out the stress tests. This was not an easy process and we received comments of all kinds on our efforts.\nI can tell you today that we now have in place the test criteria, the methodology and the timeframe, which, in my opinion, will meet the expectations of European citizens with regard to this stress test.\n(Heckling from Mr Turmes)\nSimply saying 'Rubbish' is not an argument, Mr Turmes. 'Rubbish' is not a word that we like to see in the Minutes, but if it makes you happy, then I will accept it.\nIn any case, we had a tough struggle. Firstly, many of the nuclear safety regulators were not prepared to agree to a European inspection procedure. This is because the energy mix is a matter for the Member States and because the monitoring, authorisation and supervision of nuclear power plants also falls within the remit of the Member States. I believe that the fact that we are carrying out a stress test at a European level with joint criteria is an extremely important and historic step forwards in the interest of the safety ", "Explanations of vote\nPresident\nDear colleagues, we have a lot of explanations of votes so we will have to be extremely strict with the time. I will cut everyone off after one minute. I apologise for this but that is the way it is going to be.\nOral explanations of vote\nAshley Fox\nMr President, I want to explain why I voted against the 2011 budget. I voted against it because, in a time of austerity, the EU should show restraint. We should be cutting our expenditure, not increasing it. In my view it was shameful that the Commission initially proposed a 6% increase and Parliament supported that.\nI believe that my Prime Minister, David Cameron, did a good job in forcing the level of increase down to 2.9% but we know that this was a compromise. It is not a compromise that British Conservatives are particularly pleased with and I was proud to vote against EU extravagance.\nSirpa Pietik\u00e4inen\n(FI) Mr President, it is significant that Parliament for the first time had a chance to approve the budget. In subsequent budgetary policy I think that Parliament should ensure that the priorities are that the EU is able to increase its own contribution, that the budget supports material efficiency and policy on climate change through its own choice of policies, and that in this way the Europe 2020 Strategy and a greener economy are achieved.\nSyed Kamall\nMr President, like my colleague Mr Fox, I too share the concern, as many British Conservatives did.\nAt a time of austerity, when governments across the European Union - and in fact governments across the world - are looking to tighten their belt and to rein in spending, how dare we ask for an increase in taxpayers' money? Surely it is a time to tighten our belts and to set an example. We should not have been asking for an increase, we should not even have been asking for a freeze, we should have been asking for a cut in the EU budget so that taxpayers across the European Union can take their politicians seriously and know that we underst", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nPeter Jahr\n(DE) Mr President, at this juncture, I would like to compliment the European Parliament and the rapporteur, Mr B\u00f6ge, in particular, who has increasingly established himself as a guardian of a stable European Union budget policy. In my opinion, the following aspects are important. Firstly, the European budget will still manage without having to obtain credit, and that is the way it should stay. Secondly, the Financial Perspective - in other words, the seven-year financial framework - will provide the Member States with greater planning certainty. Thirdly, we and the Member States will have to get used to the fact that there is less financial leeway. In my opinion this means, fourthly, that when the Member States transfer additional tasks to the European Union, the principle we should follow in future must be that the Member States must also provide the necessary funding.\nDaniel Hannan\nMr President, we are all familiar with the famous bicycle metaphor - the idea that the European Union has to keep moving forward or else it will topple over. I have always thought that a ravening shark would make for a better simile - it has to keep swimming lest it choke - but we will leave that aside.\nLet us examine the question of why that is the case. The truth is that the European Union has become a mechanism for the redistribution of money. It has to keep sucking in more and more funds in order to reward its favoured client groups. If it stops doing that, then the bicycle indeed topples and the shark drowns. That is why we have this extraordinary spectacle, at a time when every national government is looking to constrain spending, that the one budget that keeps rising is that of the European Union.\nIn my country, every departmental budget is looking for savings of between 25 and 40 percent, but one budget is increasing by 60 percent, namely our net contributions to the European Union. Far from stimulating the economy, we ar", "Explanations of vote\nPresident\nWe now come to the explanations of vote.\nOral explanations of vote\nIzaskun Bilbao Barandica\n(ES) Mr President, I abstained because, on 14 January, the European Council renewed the measures against C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, in view of the seriousness of the situation following the holding of the presidential elections late last year. I must say that these measures were adopted for people and entities that opposed the democratically elected president or did not submit to his authority; these entities included the autonomous ports ofAbidjan and San Pedro, as well as a number of banks.\nThe initiative's goal is development and the promotion of international trade in order to foster development. The programme is aimed at natural and legal persons. Annex I of this initiative includes C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, but includes no mention of the decision that I mentioned, which is why I abstained.\nMr President, I would also ask you who are chairing this sitting for us to improve Parliament's image, because I believe that situations such as that which we are experiencing today, and in all plenary sittings, contribute absolutely nothing from the point of view of the image and prestige that we are attempting to convey. I believe that it is unacceptable that, while any Member is speaking, there should be groups laughing and paying no attention: they could perfectly well do so outside. As I have the opportunity today, I would ask all those who chair these sittings to improve Parliament's image, which is damaging European politics.\nPresident\nAs you know, Mr Swoboda has a working group examining our proceedings in plenary and I will bring your point to his attention. I would also point out that you can always put an explanation of vote in writing if you wish.\nCsan\u00e1d Szegedi\n(HU) Mr President, I would like to raise a point of order. I have been asking to speak for about ten minutes. I would like it to be noted in the Minutes that during the last votes the Romanian politician be", "2. Civil, commercial, family and private international law aspects of the action plan implementing the Stockholm Programme (\n- Before the vote:\nLuigi Berlinguer\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, due to the change in the agenda approved yesterday by this House, I would firstly like to express my approval for the fact that the Committee on Legal Affairs has unanimously approved the draft report that we are voting on today.\nThe fact that the construction of the European judicial space finds such a broad consensus in Parliament is important. The Stockholm Programme envisages that everyday life should be intrinsic to the process of constructing a Europe of citizens and not merely of political forces or institutional representations. It sets out to resolve the everyday problems of Europeans by the real and unified creation of an effective market of labour, goods and services, entrepreneurial activity without internal borders and without red tape, to strengthen the common basis of rights of succession, contracts, consumers, timely payments, the family, children and more.\nIt will also be the duty and responsibility of the justice system, national judiciaries, solicitors, accountants and workers who operate within individual States to build Europe, to interpret the laws that unite our continent. Our past is marked by different judicial and legal traditions - Common law and Civil law - with differences between the French or German systems and histories that are sometimes very different. We respect national prerogatives and the principle of subsidiarity, but we realise that in order to build Europe - and fortunately we are still on that road - we need progressive convergence that is based on the great constitutional tradition of fundamental rights for which Europe stands.\nMr President, the Action Plan that we will approve sets out to construct, reinforce, extend and disseminate a solid European judicial culture, a European legal mindset. That is why I will vote in favour.\n", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nPeter Jahr\n(DE) Mr President, the aim of the proposal is to establish a new protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Partnership Agreement in the fisheries sector between the European Community and the Union of the Comoros.\nThe proposed resolution will determine the fishing opportunities for European Union fishing vessels, depending on the surplus fish stocks available, and the financial contribution required in return for the access rights and the support for the fishery sector.\nIn principle, I welcome this agreement. Controlled fishing is always better than uncontrolled fishing. However, we must make proper use of this agreement and constantly assess its performance. For me, the simple, na\u00efve question is that even if there are currently surplus fish stocks, we must ensure that this situation remains unchanged in the years to come.\nDaniel Hannan\nMr President, reading our voting list today, I have the feeling that I am reading a long and expensive bill of fare. Each of these items comes down to a reallocation of resources from European taxpayers either to some fishing fund, or the solidarity fund, or rescuing flood-stricken areas, or whatever it is.\nI would like to focus on one particular abuse of this process, which is the use of Article 122(2) to mobilise money for bail-outs of stricken economies, specifically that of Portugal. This fund was designed for natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods. It has been reinterpreted to mean an economy that has run out of money. It is patently illegal. Not only is it not provided for in the Treaties; it is expressly forbidden under the 'no bail-out clause'. This Chamber is in plain violation of its own regulations. In bailing out these countries, we are hurting them - because you do not help an indebted friend by pressing more loans on them - and, of course, we are hurting our own taxpayers as well as violating the law. ", "European code of conduct on arms exports (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on the European Code of Conduct for Arms Exports.\nJanez Lenar\u010di\u010d\nPresident-in-Office. - (SL) Firstly, on behalf of the Council I would like to express satisfaction with the traditionally good relations and cooperation between the Council's Conventional Arms Exports Working Group, COARM, and the European Parliament, more precisely with its Subcommittee on Security and Defence, SEDE. I am convinced that this well-organised and excellent cooperation will continue into the future, which is why I welcome today's debate.\nAllow me to say a few words about the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports. As we know, the code was adopted in 1998. It gave the European Union new impetus in monitoring the arms trade. In accordance with this code, the Union started making annual reports that are actually reports on completed arms transfers.\nThis year we will make a tenth annual report. I should also mention that these reports have become increasingly clear and informative. Because of this code, in the last few years most Member States have started to publish their national annual reports on the export of arms and military equipment. In 2003 the European Union defined its own list of arms and military equipment to be covered by the code and started more serious coordination of the policy for export to individual third countries. The Member States also exchange information concerning rejected and completed arms exports.\nThis dynamism has been transferred to international organisations, especially those in which Member States of the European Union play an important part. This applies especially to the Wassenaar Arrangement. The code was improved in 2006 and 2007, specifically with additions to the users' manual.\nAs we know, the code is not a legally binding document. However, the Member States have a political commitment to abide by its provisions. There have been attempts in ", "Situation of Christians in the context of freedom of religion (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the Statement by the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the Situation of Christians in the context of freedom of religion.\nI would like to ask Vice-President/High Representative Catherine Ashton to take the floor.\nCatherine Ashton\nVice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, I shall begin by expressing how fully I share the concerns of this House about the recent violence against people belonging to religious minorities, as well as those who stand up for religious freedom.\nI expressed my views on this issue most recently on 6 January when I visited Bethlehem and the Church of the Nativity on the eve of the Orthodox Christmas. I went there to underline the need for all religious groups around the world to be able to gather and to worship freely. I also stressed that the European Union condemns all forms of intolerance and violence against people because of their religion, wherever it takes place. I have also strongly condemned the recent terrorist attacks in Iraq and Egypt targeting places of worship, as well as the assassination of Salmaan Taseer, the Governor of the Punjab in Pakistan.\nThese attacks are unacceptable: they are perpetrated by extremists with an agenda of intolerance which must be condemned and must be resisted. Honourable Members, all too often in today's world, people's human rights are violated because of their religion or belief. The victims do not belong to a single faith or to one region. Regrettably, no part of the world is spared from the scourge of religious intolerance.\nAny discrimination or violence against individuals because of their religious beliefs runs counter to the values that we in the European Union uphold. Each violation must be taken seriously and each must be cond", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nGuido Milana\n(IT) Mr President, I should like to express my overall satisfaction about the adoption of Mr El Khadraoui's report.\nI believe it represents a step forward for consumer and environmental protection, including in terms of the positions of individual Member States, which sometimes complain of delays. Essentially, I think that by adopting this measure, Europe has demonstrated that it is further ahead than many Member States, which will clearly have to remedy this situation in short order.\nI come from a country whose government was rather tardy in expressing its interest in this directive. I therefore hope that Parliament's decision will be productive and function as a stimulus so that the attitudes and the level of attention for this issue will be substantially improved in the not too distant future.\nCristiana Muscardini\n(IT) Mr President, the 'polluter pays' principle is, without doubt, essential for resolving environmental problems aggravated by European industrial development. However, it is not always right to attack a single category; we also need to defend the principle that it cannot be solely road hauliers to pay, but also those in Europe who do not put enough energy into supporting an alternative transport system.\nEurope still has too few programmes to restructure the transport sector for more ecological solutions with a low environmental impact, and there is also a dearth of resources to improve its efficiency and environmental performance. Once again, therefore, we need to remember that we cannot cut traffic volumes because, by contrast, the amount of journeys and haulage needs to be increased. Therefore, road hauliers cannot be the only ones to pay for the ecological problems caused by others.\nVille It\u00e4l\u00e4\n(FI) Mr President, the rapporteur, the Committee on Transport and Tourism, and, obviously, Parliament as a whole, have to be congratulated on this excellent piece of legislation. This was the resul", "Membership of Parliament\nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Alain Lamassoure and Adrian Severin, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the composition of the European Parliament.\nAlain Lamassoure  \nrapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the motion for a resolution is a response to an invitation by the European Council in June. Article 9 A of the draft Treaty states that in future the composition of the Parliament will be a matter for secondary legislation. This will be a decision of the European Council, adopted by unanimity, on the initiative of the European Parliament and with its consent. The Council is inviting us to explain how this procedure should work. It wants to see us deal with this hot potato.\nFor our Parliament, this is a real political challenge. Are we capable of coming up with a reform that applies to ourselves? The last time we were asked to do this was in 2000, and Parliament did not manage to do it. For this reason the vote secured in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is already a remarkable political result. We obtained a large majority: two thirds in the final vote and three quarters on the main point, the distribution of seats, in terms of actual numbers, between the Member States.\nWhat is the problem we are facing? We should first remember that the current Parliament of 785 MEPs no longer complies with the new legal position resulting from the amended Treaty of Nice. It is this system that would apply, based on 736 MEPs, in the absence of any new decision. Up to now, in the Council and in Parliament, the Member States have been divided into categories: one supersize state, some large ones, some medium-sized, some small, etc. Each category has the same voting rights in the Council and the same number of seats in Parliament.\nThis is over! The future Treaty introduces two types of innovation in relation to this system. On the one hand, there are actual figures: a maximum of 750 MEPs, a ceiling of 96 ", "Improving the quality of teacher education (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Maria Badia i Cutchet, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on improving the quality of teacher education.\nMaria Badia i Cutchet\nrapporteur. - (ES) Commissioner, I believe we can agree that adopting a report on such a current, key topic as the quality of teacher education is good news, given that the aim of teacher education is in fact quite simply to improve pupils' education and give them knowledge which provides them with intellectual maturity and a critical mindset while at the same time providing them with the skills necessary to be able to participate in a society which is increasingly competitive and demanding.\nThis is a concern shared by many stakeholders, from pupils to their parents, the teaching profession and business leaders among others. In Europe there are currently over six million teachers performing this key role in developing the knowledge and skills of society's young people and making a decisive contribution to improving the opportunities for economic growth and greater competitiveness.\nCurrent working conditions in this sector are more complex and more demanding: classrooms are more heterogeneous from the social and cultural point of view, teaching concentrates on individual learning, teachers have gone from being ex-cathedra trainers to being classroom managers; there is a requirement to have a good knowledge of foreign languages and information and communications technologies (known as ICT), not only as a means of transmitting knowledge but to be able to use them as a teaching tool.\nThe data available to us show that there are shortcomings in teaching quality; this is in line with the increased complexity of the profession mentioned above, and it makes greater investment in teacher education crucial during both initial training and in-service training, and highlights the need for greater support in the first years of a tea", "\nPresident.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0I declare the sitting open. \n\nSwoboda (PSE ).\n\u00a0\u00a0  Mr\u00a0President, although I very much support this request for urgent procedure, I would, however, like to point out that care needs to be taken in implementing this proposal not to destroy the local economy, especially the fishing industry. Subject to that proviso, we support this proposal and the request for urgent procedure. \nKauppi (PPE-DE ).\n\u00a0\u00a0  Mr President, my point of order is not about the vote on tsunami vessels but about interpretation problems in Parliament. Yesterday I spoke here in plenary. I had a two-minute speech and my political message was totally turned upside down by the interpreters. It made me look stupid. My colleagues could not understand a word I was saying in Finnish.\nThis is a constant problem for all the small language groups in Parliament. I shall not use Finnish any more in plenary if the result is that my political message is turned upside down. The same thing happened at the start of this sitting with Polish, a very nice language. Interpretation is not up to its task and this is a terrific problem for this House. I want this noted for the record. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Your concerns will be noted in the record, Mrs Kauppi. I understand why you spoke in English rather than Finnish. It is a serious matter and we shall look into it. \nMorillon (ALDE ).\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013 Mr President, the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries will let you know how much we appreciate this request for urgent procedure. We have followed what Commissioner Borg has done since the tragedy took place and have supported him. On a practical level, we shall hold an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Fisheries at 5.30\u00a0p.m. in order to decide whether each measure, as Mr Swoboda said, is in the meeting\u2019s best interests. In principle, however, and I believe that this reflects the opinion of most Members, I am entirely in favour of the urgent procedure. \nSchlyter (Verts/ALE ).\n\u00a0\u00a0  Mr\u00a0President, we have now heard two spe", "The work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2007 (debate) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Alain Hutchinson, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2007.\nAlain Hutchinson\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report I prepared for the Committee on Development reviews the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) in 2007. Those of you who are actively involved in this work or are simply interested in it know that it is not a purely formal or symbolic structure, indeed quite the reverse, since the Assembly increasingly functions as a true parliamentary assembly. Its members are increasingly engaged in it, influential figures sound it out and as a result it is acquiring growing political importance. This is the first point that I wanted to emphasise.\nThe growing political importance of this Assembly also derives from the fact that apart from the fundamental issues relating to cooperation between ACP and EU countries, it also discusses issues which are topical both for Europeans and ACP countries. This is the case, for example, with the Economic Partnership Agreements negotiated between the Union and ACP countries. On this issue, the JPA has confirmed with the Kigali Declaration that the leaders concerned clearly want the European Commission to give ACP countries enough time to negotiate regional development agreements. Kigali is not only an opportunity to show that there is real resistance to these agreements, as they currently exist, but also that this resistance is founded on concerns which are entirely legitimate and which must now be properly taken into account.\nIn the same way, it is only through participating in the work of the Assembly that many MPs in ACP countries have learnt of the existence of Country Strategy Papers that define areas of cooperation between the EU and their own countries. This serves as a reminder that, for many MPs in ACP c", "Steps towards improving the environment for SMEs in Europe - Small Business Act (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council on steps towards improving the environment for SMEs in Europe - Small Business Act by Nicole Fontaine and Giles Chichester, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, and Edit Herczog, on behalf of the PSE Group - B6-0485/2008).\nEdit Herczog\nauthor. - Mr President, we all here in Parliament welcome the achievement of the last five years brought about by the Commission, especially Mr Verheugen, together with the European Parliament and with European enterprises: our achievement to change our approach to European enterprises, an achievement which has a name now - the Think Small First principle, laid down in the Small Business Act. We have to work on this act.\nThe current economic crisis underscores the need to adopt the Small Business Act as soon as possible. The 23 million European enterprises and the two-thirds of European employees involved need an unambiguous message that the change in our legislative approach to Think Small First is a real basis for our future work and behaviour.\nThe very first signal that we are doing that is the 'small SME' test. Therefore, because of the need for an unambiguous message, we are very sorry that the Council did not give a binding character to the provisions laid down in the Small Business Act.\nWe really hope that in the European Council next week you will come back to this question and that the prime ministers of the Member States will give some binding character to this Small Business Act. However, we welcome the Council decision on the priority actions. We think it is very important to think small first in order to improve the access to finance; very important to think small first to simplify the regulatory environment; and very important to think small first to facilitate market access.\nWe ask the Commission and the Council to act together. A more European answer is needed. Mu", "Explanations of vote\nLena Ek, Olle Schmidt and Lars Wohlin \nInterest subsidies designed to offset the Member States' interest charges in connection with the purchase of EU agricultural products are one of many drawbacks to EU agricultural policy, which needs to be radically transformed. In the interests of consistency, it should, however, be accepted that, where the new Member States are concerned, a certain amount of interest offsetting might take place to prevent mass unemployment from being created in the poorer parts of Europe.\nThis report concerns an extension to a regulation that has existed since 2004 and that compensates those new Member States whose interest substantially exceeds the EU average. The cost of an extension amounts to approximately EUR 10 million per year. It has been proposed that funding be obtained from savings within other budget headings so that there are no additional aggregate budget increases. The Commission also regards this extension as part of a package in which the removal of subsidies for maize cultivation is also proposed - a step that would mean a significant saving of approximately EUR 35 million in 2008 (with, according to the Commission, a total saving for 2008-2014 of EUR 617.8 million).\nIn the longer term, a 'no' vote would be in danger not only of having a bad effect on the new Member States, but also of jeopardising the Commission's proposed saving of just over EUR 600 million. I have therefore chosen, in spite of everything, to vote in favour of this report.\nAndreas M\u00f6lzer\n(DE) Mr President, although it is very difficult to give a statement of vote with all this noise going on, I would like to say that I abstained from voting on the grounds that I find this state of affairs unsatisfactory. Germany and a number of recalcitrant deficit-runners may well now be on the road to recovery, but I do not see that as an occasion for rejoicing, and all the less so in view of the fact that they, while benefiting from the surprising st", "A Baltic Sea Strategy for the Northern Dimension (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Alexander Stubb, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on a Baltic Sea strategy for the northern dimension.\nAlexander Stubb \nrapporteur. - Mr President, thank you for those kind words. I will try to be like a talkative Finn and use a maximum of five minutes of your time.\nI would like to set three questions. First of all, what is this report all about? Secondly, why are we tabling this report? And thirdly, what do we actually want?\nOn the first question of what this report is about, it is about a Baltic Sea Strategy for the Northern Dimension. I will stress that again, especially for the Finns sitting across the table. It is a Baltic Sea Strategy for the Northern Dimension, so the aim is to strengthen that concept.\nOur thinking in this report is that the Northern Dimension is based on three wonderful pillars. One of them is what we call the Paavo V\u00e4yrynen pillar, in other words the Arctic. The second is what we might call the Mr Paasilinna pillar, which is Russia, and the third is what we would call the Mr Beazley pillar, which is the Baltic and the Baltic Sea Strategy. This report focuses on the Baltic Sea Strategy only.\nThe report has three aims. One: to support the Northern Dimension. Two: to make the Baltic Sea a priority of the Northern Dimension - we firmly believe that should be the key area of the Northern Dimension itself. Three: we want to raise awareness of the Baltic Sea as a brand, as a concept.\nWhy are we tabling this report and why are we tabling it now? The first reason is general, and it is that after enlargement in 2004 the Baltic Sea became an inner sea, a mare nostrum. We have eight EU States around the sea, one of them is non-EU, that is Russia and then of course there is Kaliningrad. But basically it is an EU sea.\nWe have a wonderful window of opportunity for two reasons. The first is that we have the Finnish Presidency, which gives us an", "Approval of Minutes of previous sitting: see Minutes\nPaul R\u00fcbig\n(DE) Mr President, it was actually planned that today's sitting should include a debate on the roaming report, since this House, in the trilogue on 2 May, presented the Council with a package of compromises, and I might add that it did so with the agreement of all groups here and of all the countries represented in the trilogue. It is unfortunate that the Council has not, to date, indicated its agreement to it, and it is for that reason that we are unable to have the debate today or to vote on the report tomorrow.\nBrian Crowley\nA Uachtar\u00e1in, ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dh\u00e9anamh le Rialtas na h\u00c9ireann, le Rialtas na Breataine, agus leis an Rialtas nua i mB\u00e9al Feirste.\nMr President, yesterday saw the installation of a new government and the re-establishment of the devolved assembly in Northern Ireland, representing what would have previously been called the extreme opinion of unionism and the extreme opinion of nationalism, brought together to form a new government for Northern Ireland. As we have heard from the Nobel laureates, this is a great opportunity for us not only to congratulate those people who have been involved and to encourage them in finding a new way forward in solving conflict and resolving the difficulties that occur between different communities, but also to congratulate the European Union for its ongoing commitment and help to the people of Northern Ireland over the last 20 years.\nThe reasons such greatness took place yesterday was that the people there were standing on the shoulders of giants - not just the shoulders of John Hume and Lord Trimble, who are here today, but also the shoulders of Jacques Delors, who first came up with the plan and the idea of a peace programme for Northern Ireland, and of Helmut Kohl and others.\nWe should reflect on this today in making sure that we continue our commitment.

Before resuming the sitting, a legislative package will be signed to make it effective. Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the Minister for European Affairs, will sign on behalf of the Council. I am very pleased that Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner is also with us today.\nI would like to say a few words on the legislation we are about to sign today. Today, the eve of the extraordinary summit of the European Union in preparation for the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh is a good occasion to strengthen the role of the European Parliament as co-legislator. I have been asked to represent the European Parliament at the dinner of Heads of State or Government. We, the European Union, will be preparing for our participation in the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh.\nToday we have an important package of four different legislative acts under the codecision procedure approved by us in response to the financial crisis. What is in the package? A capital requirements directive, a regulation on credit rating agencies, a new regulation on cross-border payments, and a decision establishing a new programme to support specific activities in the field of financial services, financial reporting and audit.\nThe directive and the regulations are aimed at protecting EU investors and the European Union's financial system, and at increasing consumer rights guarantees and ensuring better supervision. These acts are aimed at stabilising the financial markets. We are thereby fulfilling the predictions, but the legislation we are signing was drawn up by Parliament in the previous term. Would Minister Malmstr\u00f6m like to take the floor before signing the legislative acts?\nCecilia Malmstr\u00f6m\nMr President, we are now going to sign a number of legal acts that are absolutely central to the EU's response to the financial and ec", "Statements by the President\nPresident\nBefore we begin the sitting, I would like to say that our thoughts and prayers are, today, with the families and friends of the victims and with those who were injured in the railway accident which happened last week in the north of Italy. It was, as we all remember, a very serious railway accident.\nI would also like to thank all of you, Members and staff of Parliament - many people from Parliament - for attending and for organising the ceremony on Wednesday last week at 12.00 in connection with the Polish air disaster. The funeral of the President of Poland was held yesterday, and the funeral of the President of Poland in exile was held today. On Wednesday last week, we observed a one-minute silence in memory of the victims of the disaster.\nI would like to thank you again for this act of solidarity.\nHerbert Dorfmann\n(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you most sincerely, Mr President, for the sympathy that you expressed for the victims of the accident that occurred in my region and my country, the autonomous province of Bozen - South Tyrol - last week. The people in my region are indeed extremely shocked by this accident, which cost the lives of nine, predominantly young, people and left many people injured. It is all the more shocking because this train was not an old train, but a jewel of our region and it was a new route that was only opened a few years ago. This accident was not due to a technical fault, either. It was purely and simply the result of a landslide, which is something that can occur in a mountainous region like the Alps.\nThank you very much, Mr President. I will pass on your words of sympathy to the victims and to the people of my country.\n(Applause)\nPresident\nI would like to thank everyone who is present in the House today, because we have overcome very great transport problems in getting to Strasbourg.

I would mention just the decision regarding biodiversity or the Water Framework Directive. The EU's Water Framework Directive makes Member States responsible for protecting water quality and preventing pollution. Is this a worthy goal? Yes, it is. Is it our responsibility to do everything we can in order to reach this goal? Clearly it is. Are there any mining technologies that endanger our waters and our environment? Unfortunately, there are. Moreover, there is one extremely dangerous and, at the same time, obsolete technology in particular. Along with quite a few fellow Members, I would like this technology to be banned throughout the European Union. The cyanide disaster on the Tisza River ten years ago, as well as accidents that have occurred since then, also serve as reminders of this problem.\nLadies and gentlemen, the present moment is one that is both fortunate and pressing. Fortunate, because according to the information received from the Commission, today only three countries still use this cyanide-based mining technology, and it is fortunate also because there are three other countries that have banned cyanide mining technology, thus setting an example for the other EU Member States. At the same time, it is also pressing since, on account of the rising price of gold, there are plans to open new mines throughout Europe using this dangerous and obsolete technology. This represents a serious threat to our environment.\nLadies and gentlemen, if we are serious about the need to protect our waters, we canno", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 1 March 2001.\n\nTribute\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, last week I learnt, to my great sadness, of the death of two former Members, Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz and Mr Lambrias. They both passed away on 3 March 2001.\nMrs Bloch von Blottnitz was one of the great characters of the German Green Party and a fervent supporter of the anti-nuclear campaign. She was Member of this House from 1989 to 1999, and, in particular, she was Vice-Chairman of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance of the European Parliament. She was an honest political fighter and even those who did not share her beliefs always respected her for her unwavering commitment.\nMr Lambrias was a Member of this House for 15 years, between 1984 and 1999. He was Vice-Chairman of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. All Members who knew him appreciated his human qualities and his strong commitment to European integration.\nI would like to express my condolences to both families, to the Group of the Greens and to the PPE-DE Group and I would ask you to observe a minute' s silence in memory of our two colleagues who have passed away.\n(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)\n\nStatement by the President\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, as you are aware, there has been another terrorist attack in Spain since our last part-session. During the night of 8 March, I\u00f1aki Totorika Vega, a member of the Ertzaintza, the Basque regional police force, was killed in a car bomb explosion in Hernani. On my own behalf and on behalf of the European Parliament, I have expressed our deepest sympathy and sincere condolences to the victim' s family. I have also sent a message to the Spanish Government stating our unconditional support in its fight against terrorism and I would ask you to rise and observe a minute' s silence to pay tribute to I\u00f1aki Totorika, and", "Banning of exports and the safe storage of metallic mercury (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the recommendation for second reading from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Council common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the banning of exports and the safe storage of metallic mercury\n(11488/1/2007 - C6-0034/2008 - (Rapporteur: Dimitrios Papadimoulis).\nDimitrios Papadimoulis\nMr President, let me begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs from all the political groups. Without their assistance and contribution, I could not have achieved a satisfactory compromise with the Council.\nIf approved exactly as agreed with the Council and without amendments invalidating it, the compromise text may represent a significant step towards implementing the Community Strategy Concerning Mercury. The text will put an end to the export not only of metallic mercury, but also of certain important mercury compounds that are produced in large quantities in the EU.\nThe EU is a major exporter of mercury; every year it supplies about 1 000 tonnes of the current world total of 3 600 tonnes. The proposed Regulation under discussion deals mainly with 12 000 tonnes of mercury which will become surplus in the coming years, and it will pave the way for further measures to be taken at international level. Let us not forget that mercury is a worldwide pollutant which knows no bounds. Dealing with it is a matter of priority and international concern. The Regulation will contribute significantly towards strengthening the EU's leadership role in the talks being held under the auspices of the UN Environment Programme, and also towards the adoption of an international treaty on mercury.\nThe most important provisions of the compromise text are as follows:\nIt broadens the scope of the ban on exports covering not only metallic mercury but also cinnabar ore, mercuric chloride, mercuric oxide and mixtures with a mercury con", "2. Election of a Vice-President of the European Parliament (to replace Mr Lambrinidis) (vote) \nPresident\nLet us now move on to the election of a Vice-President to fill the vacancy left by Mr Lambrinidis, who has resigned as a Member of the European Parliament. I have received a nomination for Mrs Podimata, who has agreed to the nomination. Following the same procedure I explained a short while ago, we are electing Mrs Podimata by acclamation. I can therefore announce that pursuant to Rule 13, Mrs Podimata will be elected to the position of Vice-President of the European Parliament, and will take the place of the preceding Vice-President, or in other words Mr Lambrinidis' place, in the order of precedence.\nJan Zahradil\nMr President, I would just like to thank all the political groups, and particularly the leaders of the political groups, for a very smooth arrangement that allowed us to fill these two vacant places. It sends a very good signal that the second half of our term will go as smoothly as today.\nPresident\n- Congratulations to the whole European Parliament.\n", "12. Community code relating to medicinal products for human use (implementing powers conferred on the Commission) (vote) \n- Report: Fran\u00e7oise Grosset\u00eate\nSiim Kallas\nVice-President of the Commission. - Commission Statement\nThe Commission is preparing a legislative proposal, which is on its 2008 legislative programme, to amend the Community drug-monitoring system for medicinal products for human use. There will be a radical overhaul of Title IX ('Pharmacovigilance') of Directive 2001/83/EC.\nIn this proposal, the Commission undertakes to propose recourse to the regulatory procedure referred to in Articles 5 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC for the adoption of final public-health protection measures in respect of marketing authorisations which may be necessitated as a result of evaluation of pharmacovigilance data (measures provided for in the new proposal to amend or replace the fourth subparagraph of Article 107(2) of Directive 2001/83/EC).\nIn its future proposals, the Commission also intends to maintain the existing situation whereby, under Article 107, the Commission may request Member States to take temporary measures immediately where urgent action to protect public health is necessary, without recourse to any committee procedure; it will continue recourse to the management procedure referred to in Articles 4 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC for the adoption of any other decision of an individual nature in relation to marketing authorisations for medicinal products.\n", "Use of minority languages within the framework of the European cultural heritage (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission's statement on the use of minority languages within the framework of the European cultural heritage.\nLeonard Orban\nMr President, honourable Members, the general objective of the European Union's policy on multilingualism is to highlight the importance of all the languages spoken in the European Union. In accordance with Article 151 of the treaty, the Community's actions must help encourage cooperation between Member States in order to contribute to the flourishing of Member States' cultures, while respecting at the same time their diversity at national and regional level and focusing on our common cultural heritage.\nBased on these principles, the European Commission, in close cooperation with Member States, is implementing the strategy of promoting multilingualism and linguistic diversity, featuring in the document adopted in September 2008, which is aimed at all the languages spoken in the Community. All these languages represent an integral part of our common cultural heritage, and every single national, regional, minority and migrants' language spoken in Europe offers an additional facet to this common cultural heritage.\nAs you are well aware, the European Commission has invited Member States to consider teaching regional and minority languages as part of their national strategies for promoting multilingualism in society. The decisions made by the European Union in this area are not replacing the measures already adopted by Member States, but are intended to support and supplement them. The main funding instruments available to the European Union are the Lifelong Learning Programme for the 2007-2013 period, which is open to all the languages spoken in the Community, including regional and minority languages.\nThere is no Community legislation for regulating the use of languages in Member States and none of the treaties includes optio", "14. Motion for a resolution (vote) \n- Resolution:\n- Before the vote on Amendment 10\nPhilip Bushill-Matthews\nMr President I have a brief comment concerning amendment 10. The initial amendment was apparently mistranslated into German to mean exactly the opposite of what the English said because the English text was ambiguous. So the purpose of this is to remove the ambiguity. I am sorry that there was not time to clear this with all political groups, but I hope that they will support it because it is not trying to change the text. It is merely trying to clarify and remove the ambiguity.\nPervenche Ber\u00e8s\n(FR) Mr President, I believe that it is humanly reasonable to stop this vote, even if it means restarting it tomorrow, at 11.30 a.m.\n(Applause)\nHannes Swoboda\n(DE) Mr President, I would like to endorse that comment. We need to stop the vote now. It would be unreasonable to continue voting now, especially given the length of the reports.

This is something we have already discussed in this House. Unfortunately, it is not my work to which these reports refer; instead, there are only allegations to the effect that there is something objectionable about my behaviour, but as I am unable to ascertain what I am being accused of, I ask you, Mr President, to investigate further.\nIt is also stated in the German media that you are to meet a certain Member this week and that the Member in question will then hand over certain lists to you. If this is the case, Mr President, I ask you to find out at once whether there is anything of which my colleagues or I might be accused. If there is, then I ask that you forward all the documents, at once, to the European Court of Justice or to the Court of Auditors and to OLAF.

These proposals are the result of a change in the migration strategy.\nFour points: firstly, the initial plan was to have a migration of 15 Member States in a process lasting around 8 hours. In the meantime, the number of Member States increased to 25, which made the process much more complex and difficult. Secondly, an interim technical architecture will have to be created that will allow SIS1+ and SIS II to operate in parallel for a limited transitional period. This is a wise solution that we should agree to and it will enable us to have a fallback in the event of something going wrong. Thirdly, a technical tool - a converter - will be made available during this interim period that will connect the SIS I central system to the SIS II central system, enabling both to process the same information and ensuring that all Member States stay on the same level. Lastly, the mandate given to the Commission in 2001 expires at the end of this year.\nWe raised four concerns. Firstly, the need fo", "The protection and welfare of animals 2006-2010 (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Jeggle, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the protection and welfare of animals in the period 2006 to 2010.\nElisabeth Jeggle \nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 23 January 2006, the Commission presented its Communication on a Community Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals 2006-2010.\nThe report I drew up on this Communication as rapporteur for this House was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 12 September. The objective of the Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals is to bring together Community activities previously spread across different Commission services, councils and policy areas and to structure them in accordance with uniform guidelines.\nAnimal protection is an emotional, extremely politically sensitive issue. Such protection - appropriate to the specific needs and requirements of the respective animals - should be a matter of course in our civil society. On this basis, it is important to me as rapporteur that we establish a uniform level of animal protection in the EU. The Commission has emphasised time and again that the EU's animal-protection standards, which are already high and are set to be improved still further, are an example to the world. A large majority in the committee supported my emphasis on the need for precise impact assessments in the case of all legislative measures on animal protection. In addition, it is only consistent to demand these high animal-protection standards in negotiations with the WTO and in bilateral agreements.\nGenuine animal protection cannot be restricted to farmed animals and animals used in experiments, but must cover all animals. In addition, the progress that has been made must be taken into account. Many of my fellow Members, and many people who have written to me, are particularly concerned ab", "Building a Global Climate Change Alliance (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is a brief presentation of the report by Mr Wijkman, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on building a Global Climate Change Alliance between the European Union and poor developing countries most vulnerable to climate change\nAnders Wijkman\nrapporteur. - Mr President, this report is a response to the Global Climate Change Alliance, which was launched by the European Commission towards the end of last year. Basically, the Global Climate Change Alliance is a very good initiative. It is, first and foremost, a recognition that low-income countries will be seriously at risk because of climate change.\nIt is an irony that, only eight years ago, the Millennium Development Goals were agreed upon in New York. There was hardly any mention of climate change, yet it was obvious - already then - that many low-income countries would suffer badly from the adverse effects of climate change.\nThe way we are organised, however, in national organisations, in governments etc. - climate change on its track, development cooperation on another track - was already a real impediment or hindrance towards fully recognising the threat of climate change to development and poverty reduction.\nThe challenge is, of course, great. In order to assist low-income countries in adaptation and risk reduction and in mitigation efforts, and to look for synergies between the two, there must be a special focus on deforestation and then, finally and most importantly, implementing all these concerns in the context of development planning and poverty reduction.\nIt is crucial that we do not end up with a series of stand-alone adaptation projects. Rather, we have to mainstream adaptation and risk reduction into development cooperation.\nThe big question when we discussed this in the Committee on Development was how to finance this. The Commission proposal entails only EUR 60 million. It is a drop in the ocean. Nobody knows h", "Announcement by the President\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, welcome to you all. I would like to begin with some comments about the situation regarding the plenary chamber in Strasbourg. As you know, due to the partial collapse of the false ceiling in the plenary chamber in Strasbourg on 7 August, this first part-session of the European Parliament in September has had, exceptionally, to be held here in Brussels. I took this decision with a view to ensuring the greatest possible safety of Members and staff, based on my perusal of the initial expert reports and after consultation with the chairpersons of the groups and the French Council Presidency. The decision also takes account of the need to maintain continuity in the European Parliament's legislative work.\nThe preliminary findings of the investigations indicate that the partial collapse of the false ceiling was caused by fractures in the building components which connect the suspended ceiling with the actual ceiling structure. The investigations are ongoing and are being carried out by several independent international structural engineering firms commissioned by Parliament with a view to establishing further details and responsibilities for the collapse. These investigations are being carried out in very close cooperation with the relevant local authorities as well as with a senior buildings safety expert appointed by the French Government. The apportionment of responsibility and liability between the contractors involved in the construction of the original ceiling will be established on the basis of the final investigation reports, once they are available. The false ceiling in the plenary chamber will now be re-suspended using a new technique which has been approved by the independent experts and the local buildings authorities.\nAlthough every effort is being made to complete the work as soon as possible, the procedure involved is, of necessity, somewhat lengthy. Nonetheless, we hope that all the safety invest", "Explanations of vote\nProinsias De Rossa \nin writing. In supporting this joint Resolution I want to highlight the demand that the EU must now use all the instruments at its disposal, including the EU association agreement with Israel, to end the violence in Gaza which has condemned the Palestinians to a slow death and risks setting the whole Middle East on fire. Israel, as a democratic state, needs to ask itself questions. Lawlessness cannot be allowed to be the answer to lawlessness. The Israeli government must end its blockade of Gaza and there must be an immediate resumption of aid to Palestine, and support for the government of national unity.\nI support the call for an international inquiry into the possible use by Israeli forces of weapons of mass destruction, as was suspected in Lebanon. I also support the idea of an international peace conference bringing together all the actors in the Middle East, including Syria and Iran. I demand an international force in Gaza.\nWe have contributed to the chaos in Palestine and we have allowed the Israelis to go too far in the name of their legitimate right to protect their security. We now have mistakes to make up for.\nVasco Gra\u00e7a Moura \nin writing. - (PT) I wish to state that I voted against the joint resolution on the situation in Gaza.\nI did so not because I do not consider the military excesses that have struck at civilian populations to deserve condemnation, but because I feel that the overall content of the statement includes some highly negative terms for the State of Israel, which has been the victim of constant terrorist attacks. That is in no way justifiable.\nPedro Guerreiro \nin writing. - (PT) Israel is escalating its aggression against the Palestinian people with impunity, as shown by the Beit Hanun massacre and the criminal, inhuman blockade of the Gaza Strip, which has been turned into a vast concentration camp.

This method guarantees the involvement of all Member States, and Community institutions, in the decision-making processes, and this from the very beginning.\nThe G4's way of tackling the banking and financial crisis in 2008 was the opposite of respect for the aforementioned method, which Mr Barroso called for yesterday afternoon. In 2008, we waited in vain for President Barroso to call for order.\nThe European Union is of course France, the United Kingdom, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Italy - all members of the G4 - but it is also Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Latvia, Romania, Poland, Hungary, Luxembourg and so on, which were excluded from an important phase in the decision-making process in 2008.\nPresident Barroso, you should have enforced respect for the Community method in 2008, via the same statement you made yesterday. This is why I am unable to support your candidacy.\nMr President, may I add a personal remark. It is difficult for those who have the floor to speak with this din all around.\nCrescenzio Rivellini\n(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after my speech I will say a few words in Neapolitan (Part not transcribed in this document, since Neapolitan is not an official language). I will do so not for reasons of local colour, but to attract political and media attention to our emergencies: the emergencies of southern Italy. I voted for President Barroso, not least because I hope that he will be the President of the whole of Europe, including southern Italy.\nLocated as it is in the middle of the Mediterranean, the South is the gateway to Europe and the link between different worlds.

They are the result of a year of intensive consultation and", "The regional impact of earthquakes (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Nikolaos Vakalis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the regional impact of earthquakes.\nNikolaos Vakalis  \nMadam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I requested this report after I made the following discovery: although earthquakes in the 20th century have killed 1.5 million people worldwide and injured many more; although earthquakes are the second most deadly natural disaster in the world; and although in 2002-2007, earthquakes were the fourth most frequent natural disaster in the Member States and the candidate countries, we in the EU responded to the problem only occasionally and peripherally, and only in the context of other natural disasters.\nI now feel vindicated and satisfied that my report has been approved by the Committee on Regional Development and enjoys the support of all the political groups. The European Parliament's message is clear: in future we, the EU, must not and cannot deal with the problem of earthquakes intermittently and peripherally; we must focus on it as a distinct, separate problem and examine all of its individual aspects and components.\nIn particular, the report asks the Commission to waste no time in preparing a communication containing an earthquake risk assessment and an examination of prevention, management, relief and restoration measures. In other words, the communication has to be equivalent to that on floods. The European Parliament expects the Commission to examine, at least within the scope of such a communication, a number of proposals contained in the report.\nFirstly, the adoption of earthquake protection measures should in future be an essential requirement for the funding of infrastructure from the Structural Funds, especially in view of the fact that earthquakes threaten the overall economic and social cohesion of the regions affected. Earthquakes are, above all, a threat to life and limb, infrastructure", "6. 2010 progress report on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (\nBefore the vote:\nNikolaos Salavrakos\n(EL) Madam President, I wish to submit a motion in accordance with Rule 177 to adjourn the debate, because Mr Zoran Thaler, who acted as the rapporteur for this report, is no longer with us, following the serious allegations made in the Sunday Times. In my view, he enjoys a presumption of innocence; however, in light of the accusations against him, the present report on FYROM does not enjoy a presumption of credibility. At best, this report will harbour a seed of doubt. I therefore move that the debate be adjourned, that a new rapporteur be appointed, and that it be re-tabled in three months' time, in order to maintain Parliament's integrity.\nPresident\nWe indeed have a new rapporteur who has taken over the report. Mr Vigenin, if you care to take the floor, I will allow you to do so briefly.\nKristian Vigenin\nMadam President, we should not enter into this propaganda exercise. This report has been discussed.\n(Applause)\nThere was broad agreement between all political groups on this report. It was adopted by the Committee on Foreign Affairs by an overwhelming majority. We had a good debate yesterday, and I would ask you to continue with the vote now.\nEduard Kukan\nMadam President, I want to propose that the final vote on this resolution be a roll-call vote.\nPresident\nLet us wait until we get to the final vote and we will see if the House wishes to do that.\nGerard Batten\nMadam President, it says that roll calls may be taken with 24 hours notice. If there is another rule which supersedes this and says a roll call can be decided by Parliament, would you please tell us what the number is. Otherwise, we could all request roll calls when we felt like it.\nPresident\nI have the power as your presiding Vice-President today to decide whether we take a roll-call vote or not. It is Rule 20 that gives me the power, but I am going to ask the House nevertheless. Let us have a show ", "7. Public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents (\nMichael Cashman\nrapporteur. - Mr President, I was given a mandate by the House to enter into negotiations with the other institutions on this important dossier. Sadly, I have to report that the negotiations have not been productive, and therefore I am recommending to the House today that we do not vote and that we refer the decision on this important dossier to the next Parliament, when I expect the Commission to produce a new proposal in the autumn of this year.\nAndris Piebalgs\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission takes note of the decision of Parliament to postpone the vote on the legislative resolution accompanying Mr Cashman's report until the next parliamentary term. While fully respecting Parliament's decision, the Commission is not convinced that the vote closing Parliament's first reading would tie the hands of the next Parliament. Therefore, the Commission will reconsider its proposal only after the two branches of legislative authority have adopted their positions, but intends to continue to pursue a constructive dialogue with both institutions in the mean time and confirms its willingness to seek a compromise with Parliament and the Council.\nMichael Cashman\nrapporteur. - Mr President, I think that illustrates why it is extremely important that the next Parliament exercises every single prerogative that it has. A dialogue means that each institution has to listen. So far, neither of the institutions is listening to Parliament. For that reason, we should not take the vote and we should fully empower the next Parliament.\n(Applause)\nPresident\nI am not sure whether congratulations are in order for Mr Cashman. Yes? Then we congratulate him.\n", "Announcement by the President\nPresident\nAs you know, a large number of French trade unions have officially announced their intention to strike on Thursday, namely, on 23 September 2010. The strike action will include public transport workers and will begin on Wednesday, 22 September, at 22:00. We have also received information that the strike may even start two hours earlier, namely at 20:00. The Conference of Presidents has decided that Parliament will follow its normal work schedule and that this month's part-session will end, as planned, after the vote on Thursday.\nThe strike will have an impact on air and rail services, as well as public transport services, including buses and trams, in France. It may, therefore, become impossible to ensure the same access to transport that we have enjoyed to date. However, we have taken all the necessary measures to provide you with transport which will enable you to return home. The first arrangements have been made, although there are more to come.\nThe initial arrangements are as follows. The chartered Thalys train will circulate as usual, and the bus shuttle service between the European Parliament and the train station will be guaranteed. That has already been arranged. Travel to various airports outside of French territory will be provided by our services. The College of Quaestors has already issued a communication containing details of additional resources to allow the current travel restriction of 20 km for vehicles used on official business to be lifted, in order to facilitate travel to airports in Switzerland and Germany. The 20 km limit which applies to the European Parliament's official vehicles will therefore be lifted. You will be able to travel further in those vehicles. The Strasbourg municipal authorities will make an announcement this week and will keep MEPs up to date on all alternative means of transport.\nThe Bureau of the European Parliament will meet today at 18:30. We will discuss, step by step and in detai", "Question Time (Commission) \nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B6-0001/2009).\nWe are going to deal with a series of questions addressed to the Commission.\nPart one\nPresident\n\nSubject: Ten years of the euro\nIn light of the recent celebrations to mark the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the euro, can the Commission comment on the key lessons learnt in terms of the coordination of fiscal policy across the euro area, especially in light of the recent financial and economic crisis?\nJoaqu\u00edn Almunia\nMember of the Commission. - While the experiences with budgetary coordination have, overall, been positive, some lessons can be drawn. The analysis of the first 10 years reinforces the case for strengthening the effectiveness of budgetary surveillance in good times. It also shows the need to address broader issues which may affect the macroeconomic stability of a Member State and the overall functioning of economic and monetary union.\nFiscal policy coordination should better guide national budgetary behaviour over the whole cycle - that is, both in good times and in bad times. Increased attention should be paid to monitoring public debt developments while medium-term budgetary objectives should be strengthened to address implicit liabilities. All these kinds of developments call for deeper budgetary surveillance.\nBut surveillance should also be broadened to take account of developments within Member States that may affect budgetary sustainability, such as the growth of current account deficits, persistent inflation divergences, persistent divergences in the evolution of unit labour costs, or trends of unbalanced growth.\nSurveillance must build on the existing instruments. The key instruments for fiscal policy surveillance and economic policy coordination are clearly anchored in the Treaty and, indeed, in the Stability and Growth Pact.\nThe recent adoption of the European economic recovery plan by the Commission on 26 November last year also breaks new ground as far a", "Parliament's position on the new 2011 Draft Budget as modified by the Council (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Sidonia El\u017cbieta J\u0119drzejewska and Helga Tr\u00fcpel, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2011, all sections, as modified by the Council (17635/2010 - C7-0411/2010 -.\nSidonia El\u017cbieta J\u0119drzejewska\nMr President, after many months of negotiations, discussions and tension, we will have finally managed - tomorrow I hope - to adopt the European Union 2011 budget here at the European Parliament plenary session. I would like to start positively with what I believe to be the most interesting and effective of the achievements of the 2011 budget, and those that are of particular significance for European citizens.\nFirst and foremost, I am very pleased that we managed to reach an agreement on time, that the difficult negotiations with the Member States and the European Commission were completed before the end of 2010, and that we managed to avoid the hazard of a provisional 2011 budget, even though each of the parties, of course, had to compromise to a certain extent. I would like to draw your attention to several valuable and interesting aspects regarding the specific details of what we managed to negotiate.\nFirst and foremost, this relates to the joint position that we drew up, and the unanimous adoption of Parliament's proposal of October 2010 regarding the European Parliament's priorities in terms of budgetary obligations. All our proposals regarding increased funding for the budget lines which are vital for youth, education, mobility, innovation, research programmes and for programmes relating to key issues in international affairs were accepted by the Council and the Commission. I am pleased about this. It should also be noted that Parliament was very realistic and disciplined in its October reading. I am pleased that the Council and the Member States took note of this discip", "Decision on urgent procedure\nPaolo De Castro\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, here we are once again discussing the crisis in the milk sector.\nThe dramatic nature of this crisis continues to concern us, just as European farmers continue to express their hardship and voice their fears for the future. Parliament has already expressed its views on this matter, both by adopting a resolution with our proposals and by adopting the Commission proposal to extend the intervention period for milk powder and butter, to which we added the request for the measure on the private storage of cheese. At that time, we pointed out that the measures proposed by the Commission did not go nearly far enough.\nWe now have to decide whether or not to allow the urgent procedure for the extension of Article 186 of the single CMO Regulation to the dairy sector, namely the possibility for the Commission to decide, in the event of a market crisis, to implement emergency measures without going through the normal procedure in Parliament. Yesterday evening, an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development was held to discuss this, with Mrs Fischer Boel attending.\nFirstly I, and the committee which it is my honour to chair, would like to thank the Commissioner for coming to us in Parliament right at the end of the Agricultural Council which was held in Luxembourg. This gesture was one of great attentiveness which we appreciated.\nYesterday evening, the debate was very spirited, Mr President, and our fellow Members voiced a lot of criticism. First of all, it was pointed out that the Commission was very slow to act, and did not adequately grasp the seriousness of the crisis under way.\nThen the objection was raised that Article 186 deprives Parliament of its decision-making prerogatives, thereby giving carte blanche to the Commission. It was also said that the Commission should have made more funds available to tackle the crisis. These are legitimate concern", "14. Amendment of the Rules following the establishment of a common Transparency Register (\nPresident\nDear colleagues, I have a statement to read.\nThe Casini report on the interinstitutional agreement on a common transparency register between the European Parliament and the Commission represents an important step forward in regulating relations of MEPs with outside interests. Before we proceed to the vote on the report, I would like to underline that the ongoing activities of the working group on the code of conduct for MEPs and outside interests do not intend to put into question the substance of the agreement reached with the Commission and the content of the Casini report. They rather aim at complementing the framework by adding new aspects and, in particular, at strengthening the applicable rules as regards access of interest groups to the European Parliament premises.\n(Interjection from the floor: 'Amen!'

However, before I address the text that has been tabled, allow me to mention briefly the decisive events that these two programmes have faced over the past year.\nUnder the German Presidency, in June 2007 the Council endorsed a courageous decision to discontinue the unsuccessful negotiations on concessions. This initiative was followed by the European Parliament's Resolution expressing strong support for the two programmes to be continued under the auspices of the European Union, and making an unequivocal call for the entire funding to be secured from the European Union's budget.\nWhen later on, in September 2007, the Commission tabled a bundle of proposals which would steer the projects towards 100% funding from the public sector, amongst the proposals was a regulation on implementation. Owing to the agreement reached in November last year between the ECOFIN Council and the European Parliament on a resolution, and a general decision which the TTE Council endorsed a week later, through conclusions regarding the future development of Galileo, we have succeeded in getting the two programmes out of the cul-de-sac and returned them to the public domain.\nI am pleased that when they were looking for a compromise on the legal basis so that the Galileo project could be broug", "Roaming on public mobile networks (signature of act) \nPresident\nIt is my great pleasure, Madam Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, President of the European Council, to sincerely welcome you today to this extraordinary plenary session of the European Parliament.\n(Applause)\nWe eagerly await your report on the results of the European Council of 21/22 June and the activities and achievements of the German Council Presidency. It is also a pleasure to greet the Commission President, Mr Dur\u00e3o Barroso. Welcome, Mr Commission President.\nBefore we come to the discussion on the summit, however, it is a joyful experience, together with the President of the European Council, to sign an important new EU regulation. With our signature under the Roaming Regulation, we are at the same time rounding off a successful collaboration on behalf of the citizens of the European Union.\n(Audio problems)\nEurope does not always succeed immediately. If we are patient, however, it will succeed.\nAs far as technology is concerned, there is still more to do. The Commission President is right about a technology institute. Mr Commission President, we must move forward.\nToday is a good day for 140 million mobile-telephone users in the European Union. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have acted quickly, decisively and efficiently on behalf of our citizens. In a record time of only eleven months after the tabling of the draft regulation through the Commission, the new Roaming Regulation comes into force at the end of this week, on 30 June.\nAt this point, I would specifically like to thank the Commission and especially Commissioner Reding for her initiative, her bold proposal and her active role in the course of negotiations.\n(Applause)\nMy thanks also go to the Council Presidency, which recognised the importance of this ruling for Europe's citizens and therefore campaigned for a speedy solution at Council level with great dedication and successful negotiating skills.\nSpecial thanks g", "3.

I know, because in my country they are the same. However, now we bear a shared responsibility for the future of our continent. The old and new Europe are no more. This is our Europe! We want it to be modern and strong. And we want our citizens to see it as such. This calls for energy and hard work. It is a goal that generations of Europeans have dreamed of and one worthy of the great effort needed to achieve it. I am ready to do that work and make that effort, because those dreams were also my dreams.\n(Applause)\nLadies and gentlemen, as we begin this new parliamentary term, Europe and we ourselves - its representatives - face many challenges. We must meet those challenges. We must remember that, in striving for a better Europe, the European Parliament plays a special role, a role that is not only institutional, but also social, a deeply symbolic role.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I dare say you have taken note of yesterday\u2019s statement by President Ahmadinejad of Iran, who has expressed a desire to wipe the State of Israel off the map, claiming that this is what Ayatollah Khomeini would want. That is a monstrous thing to say, and in saying it, the President of Iran is aligning himself with terrorists. We see Israel\u2019s integrity and security as being of great value, and we defend them.\nSpeaking on behalf of my group, I wish to announce our intention to make an issue of this. We will be proposing it at the next part-session of this House, and I would welcome support from the other groups. I see that Mrs\u00a0Koch-Mehrin and Mr Swoboda are here, along with others who might well give their support. \nHannes Swoboda,\n\u00a0\u00a0 . Mr President, if this statement really was made in these terms, that is of course utterly unacceptable to anyone in this House and cannot be passed over in silence. It is because this demands an appropriate response that I wish, on behalf of my group, to express my strong support for Mr Poettering\u2019s idea that this should be put on the order of business for the next part-session. \nSilvana Koch-Mehrin,\n\u00a0\u00a0 . Mr President, if these statements have indeed been made, we too find them unacceptable, scandalous and dangerous. It is in itself staggering enough for a president to address a conference with the theme of \u2018a world without Zionism\u2019 and to express himself in such terms. Such a thing is absolutely unacceptable, and we endorse the motion that it be made the subject of a debate in this House. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Your proposals have been noted, as has your stated intention of, in due course, bringing this matter before such bodies as the Conference of Presidents. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0276/2005) by Mr Mavrommatis, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the annual report on the activities of the European Ombudsman for the year 2004 (2005/2", "\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 29 September 2005. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Ladies and gentlemen, today we are sharing in the pain of the families of the many victims of the natural disasters that took place last week: a terrible earthquake in south Asia and Hurricane Stan in Central America.\nThe earthquake, which has struck Pakistan, the north of India and Afghanistan, has led to thousands of deaths, many injured and immense material losses. The damage has been greatest in Kashmir in particular.\nA great tragedy has struck Central America. Hurricane Stan passed through several countries in the region, caused huge material damage and irreparable human losses. The consequences are difficult to overcome, and will continue to be so for a long time to come.\nOn behalf of the European Parliament, our President, Josep Borrell, immediately expressed our solidarity and our sympathies to the authorities of the countries affected by these tragedies.\nThe European Union has acted quickly, mobilising and offering emergency aid to the affected regions and their inhabitants. We shall have to consider how we are going to contribute to the reconstruction effort in the regions that have been struck by these disasters in cooperation with the governments of the countries affected.\nWe in the European Parliament wish to express our solidarity, our love and our support to the families and victims in Asia and Central America. We stand beside them at this extremely hard and difficult time.\nI would now like to ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to observe a minute\u2019s silence in memory of these people who have been taken away from us forever by the cruel forces of nature.\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 It is also my sad duty to inform you of the death on 8 October of our fellow Member, J\u00fcrgen Zimmerling.\nAs you know, Mr Zimmerling was a Member of our Parliament during the last term in office and had been sitting once again on behalf of the Group of the European Peo", "Information on medicinal products (Community code relating to medicinal products) - Information on medicinal products (Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on\nthe report by Christofer Fjellner, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending, as regards information to the general public on medicinal products subject to medical prescription, Directive 2001/83/EC on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use - C6-0516/2008 -, and\nthe report by Christofer Fjellner, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending, as regards information to the general public on medicinal products for human use subject to medical prescription, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency - C6-0517/2008 -.\nChristofer Fjellner\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at last, we have come to the plenary debate on the new legislation on information on medicinal products. What we are about to debate is the last part of what certain people are calling the most controversial issue in the medicinal products package, namely, information on medicinal products. I will admit that as recently as a year ago, I probably would never have believed that we would come to plenary together in as much agreement as we have nevertheless achieved here in Parliament. The fact that this is the case is largely down to my shadow rapporteurs. It is their constructive proposals and their willingness to compromise that has helped us to reach agreement and hopefully adopt this report with considerable support in pl", "Question Time (Council) \nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B6-0457/08).\nThe following questions are addressed to the Council.\n\nSubject: Policy on the supply of agricultural products\nIn view of the fact that fear of a food shortage has caused alarm at international level (thus prompting certain countries to restrict or impose special taxes on agricultural products intended for export), is the Council now considering the possibility that the common foreign and security policy should focus on the security of the supply of those products and encompass specific agreements with the main countries which supply them?\nJean-Pierre Jouyet\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Madam President, Mr Medina Ortega, at its meeting of 19 and 20 June this year, the European Council acknowledged that the recent escalation in food prices is a source of anxiety both in the European Union, where the crisis mainly affects low-income households, and internationally with particular reference to the developing countries. The reasons behind this phenomenon are complex. The first is the growth in global demand, especially among the main emerging economies. The second is related to rising production and transport costs, caused in part by the rise in oil prices. The third is linked to the way the financial markets work, to the speculation on international markets and local food markets. Lastly, some major producing countries have had bad harvests because of poor climate conditions. The General Affairs and External Relations Council next month will consider these questions again, looking firstly at the need to improve food security in coordination with the United Nations, and secondly at the international financial institutions and the G8. The IMF and the World Bank have scheduled meetings and I am very pleased that Mr Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations, has set up a high-level team to consider the food crisis.

Twenty-two languages make 462 combinations. Thirty-five languages make 1 090 combinations. Can you imagine a translation from Finnish, via English and French, to Polish? With direct translation some will vote for budget line 2 while others are still voting on budget line 1. With more than one relay our system will not work. If we do not go for reform, then most of us will no longer be able to use our own language. In two years we might have ten new Member States. Our buildings are not prepared for that.\nSoon even more countries - from the Ukraine to the Balkans - will be applicant countries. We risk a Babel-like confusion. Our next President must dedicate himself to internal reform and successful enlargement. Indeed our next President will not have much time to travel around.\nWe need a craftsman, a handyman, rather than a statesman. All of us will be to blame if we are not prepared for enlargement by 2004. How we vote today is part of that responsibility.\nEvery vote for me is a clear signal to Mr Cox and Mr Martin: limit your ambitions to enlargement and internal reform. Today we lose a lot of time over badly prepared votes. If journalists ask how we voted, we do not always know. If we knew, we would not have time to serve our people. We would then be bad MEPs. Leave it to the committees to prepare the votes. Let the plenary deal with the important political issues. Give us at least one week to consult and consider how we will vote.

That cost does not appear, nor does the suggestion about the number of trees that might be involved in a year in roll call votes. I mention this in particular because the Green Group managed to call for more roll call votes than anybody else. They should think of the trees!\n\nPresident\nMr Kellett-Bowman, that was not the subject of the discussion but of course we will raise it and consider it.\n\nvan Dijk\nMadam President, I am very sorry but I have to speak up here. I am not usually inclined to comment on the Minutes, but Mr Kellett-Bowman should remember that the Green Group is not the only one to request roll call votes. Moreover, the Green Group is very much the group which constantly sees to it that trees are planted everywhere in Europe, forests are protected and roads are not built because they interfere with nature and destroy nature. So do not accuse the Green Group of destroying the environment by asking for roll call votes. You, Mr Kellett-Bowman, belong to a group which is constantly advocating trans-European networks which will ruin the natural environment everywhere.\n\nPresident\nMrs Van Dijk, we are discussing the approval of the Minutes!\n\nWijsenbeek\nMadam President, I had asked to speak before Mrs Van Dijk began talking about the networks, which cannot be discussed if there are no motorcyclists.\nI refer you to the proceedings for 18-19 June, page 18: in connection with what Mrs Larive said just before Mrs van Dijk spoke.

Firstly, because it takes place in the spring. Secondly, because traps are used. Thirdly, because it is done from motorboats on the sea.\nThere is very strong opposition to the hunting and the Committee on Petitions has recently received two thick volumes detailing the latest infringements of the principles on which hunting is supposed to be conducted. As you can see, there is a photograph of an osprey on the cover. The osprey is an endangered bird in Europe, yet it is being hunted and killed in Malta.\nIt should be borne in mind that the hunting expeditions described only target migrating birds. This is because no birds spend any length of time on Malta. These are all birds that fly enormous distances, often from southern Africa up to northern Europe or back. They land on Malta simply to rest a short while, only to die at the hands of the hunters.\nLadies and gentlemen, we have ascertained that most of the inhabitants of Malta are opposed to this hunting. The Committee on Petitions undertook a special fact finding mission to Malta last year to report on the situation. We formed the impression that only a small proportion of the population is involved in hunting. These people are, however, drawn from many different political parties and therefore enjoy the support of various politicians on both sides of the political divide. This means that although the h", "3. Mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (vote) \n- Report: Reimer B\u00f6ge\n- Before the vote:\nReimer B\u00f6ge\nrapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, may I ask you to ensure that Members are seated for the vote, because we need the prescribed majorities. That is very important for the next three reports, otherwise there will be a problem tomorrow with the vote on the budget for 2008. I therefore request that you ask my fellow Members kindly to sit down and take part in the vote, otherwise we shall have a serious problem.\nPresident\nThank you, Mr B\u00f6ge, you are absolutely right. Can I ask those colleagues who are not yet sitting down to please come and take their seats. We have roll-call votes which require a qualified majority; they are important votes. Please, can you go to your seats?\n", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nGerard Batten\nMr President, I want to give an explanation of vote on the calendar for 2012. Of course, what we were voting on was utter nonsense, because it does not address the problem of the three different parliaments: Strasbourg, Brussels and, of course, Luxembourg, which everybody forgets about. The total combined costs, I believe, are something in the region of EUR 250 million per month.\nWhat I would like to do is to offer a constructive suggestion. Instead of meeting on twelve different occasions in Strasbourg, why do we not meet on twelve different sessions in Strasbourg in one week: first day - three sessions; second day - three sessions; third day - three sessions; fourth day - three sessions. That way, we only need to spend one week a year here. We can spend the rest of the time in Brussels if we have to, and we can save an enormous amount of cost and an enormous amount of inconvenience.\nDaniel Hannan\nMr President, there is something extraordinary about the monthly peregrination of this Parliament between the two seats. We preach fiscal rectitude and yet we spend hundreds of millions of pounds a month on shifting our interpreters and our committee clerks and all the Members. We talk about global warming and yet we emit thousands of tonnes of greenhouse gases as fleets of lorries transport the necessary documentation back and forth.\nI know there is an argument that Members of this House make for the symbolic significance of Strasbourg and the historic idea, and so on, and I am rather attracted to the idea that the EU, as a club of nations, should share the institutions around rather than concentrating everything in Brussels. But let us have one seat, one way or the other. Why do we not simply put it to this House that we should meet either permanently here in this handsome Alsatian town or we should meet permanently in Brussels?\nEither way, let us cut out the waste and let us, in this time of austerity, try an", "10.

The word would be 'transitional', and the amendment would then read as follows: 'except for temporary, transitional derogations'.\nJoost Lagendijk\non behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, after yesterday's debate, I would like to propose replacing the word 'involve' with 'consult'.\n", "Order of business\nPresident\nThe final draft of the agenda for this sitting, as agreed by the Conference of Presidents meeting on Wednesday, 16 May 2007, in accordance with Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been circulated. It has been requested that the draft be amended as follows:\nTuesday:\nThe Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has moved that the final vote on Mrs Aubert's report on organic production and labelling of organic products be deferred to the June part-session in Strasbourg.\nMonica Frassoni\non behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to clarify our request to postpone the vote until the June part-session. Our request is made for reasons of 'legislative technique', a somewhat mysterious term meaning that, in our opinion, postponing the vote for a few weeks could help our institution to negotiate an outcome that is positive, or at least more positive than the situation that would arise if we were to vote on this draft tomorrow. As you are aware, this issue holds great importance for the citizens. For this reason we have called for the legal basis supported by Parliament as a whole to be changed. I call on my fellow MEPs to support our request for postponement of the vote, rather than referring the draft back to committee.\nPresident\nI take it that this justification was also an argument in favour of the motion, so now we need someone to put the case against it.\nStruan Stevenson\non behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, much as I hate to disagree with Mrs Frassoni, we deferred the Aubert report at the last part-session and sent it back to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. There seems to be little chance of achieving a legal base and for that reason all of the coordinators, bar the Verts/ALE Group, agreed that this matter should go to the final vote during this part-session - that vote is due to take place tomorrow.

Strengthening European legislation in the field of information and consultation of workers (vote) \n- Motion for a resolution:\n- Before the vote:\nPhilip Bushill-Matthews\nMr President, this resolution has been tabled in the name of certain political groups, but the name of the PPE-DE Group does not appear. That might give the impression that we have somehow been excluded from the process, given that we spoke out against having a resolution in the first place as we will shortly be producing a report in committee. However, the fact is that we have been actively involved in the discussions with other groups. We share the general desire to see this legislation reviewed and modernised and have indeed contributed significantly to the text in its final form. I just wanted to record that although we still have certain reservations over some of the wording, I am pleased to confirm that PPE-DE Group policy will be to vote in favour of this resolution.\nPresident\nThat concludes the vote.\n", "Statements by the President\nPresident\nJust over a fortnight ago, I took part in the ceremonies at Westerplatte to commemorate the seventieth anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War. That war plunged Europe into terror, claimed millions of victims and divided our continent for nearly half a century. We should never forget that war and violence could once again return to this Europe of ours.\n\nI must refer to another act of violence that took place this summer. Two officers of the Spanish Civil Guard were killed by ETA whilst performing their duties.\nI am sorry to have to inform Parliament of the death of Mr Ernest Gline, a former Belgian Member of this House, who passed away on 10 August at the age of 78. Mr Gline was a Member of the European Parliament between 1968 and 1994. He also served as Chairman of the Socialist Group between 1979 and 1984.\nI regret to have to inform you also of the death of Sir Christopher Prout, a former British Member of this House, who passed away on 12 July at the age of 67. Sir Christopher Prout, who subsequently became Lord Kingsland, was a Member of the European Parliament between 1979 and 1994. He also served as Chairman of the Group of European Democrats between 1987 and 1994.\nBefore we move on to our discussions, I invite you to join with me in honouring the memory of those who laid down their lives in the defence of Europe, and of those others who devoted their lives to its service, working to transform it into what it now is.\n(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)\n", "Question Time (Council) \nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B6-0462/2008). The following questions have been submitted to the Council.\n\nSubject: Importance given to road transport policy\nParliament has expressed its position at first reading on the 'road transport package', consisting of proposals for the modification of three regulations on, respectively: access to the occupation of road transport operator; access to the market in the carriage of goods by road; and access to the market in the carriage of passengers by coach and bus (recast -. These regulations concern and affect the activity of more than 800 000 transport operators in Europe, as well as some 4.5 m jobs. It is vital that there should be a clear legislative framework making it possible to promote business and development strategies\nGiven that the new version of the regulation on access to the occupation of road transport operator will come into force on 1 June 2009, and that by 1 January 2012 the Member States should have interconnected their national electronic registers as defined by that regulation, can the Council state what degree of priority is being given to the 'road transport package' for the next five months, and what timetable is proposed to enable the new modified regulations to be adopted by 1 June 2009?\nJean-Pierre Jouyet\nMr President, first I want to express my sympathy following the shooting of 10 people at a Finnish school in Kauhajoki. My sincere condolences go to the families of the victims and to Finnish MEPs either here in this Chamber or detained by their work.\nTo answer Mrs \u0162ic\u0103u's question, I just wanted to say that in its session on 13 June 2008 the Council reached a political agreement on the three proposals in the road transport package. The purpose of these new texts is to harmonise national regulations, which can differ and are therefore a source of legal uncertainty for road transport operators.\nThe principal amendments that have been made are basically as follows", "Decision on urgent procedure\nPresident\nThe Council is requesting the application of the urgent procedure with regard to the proposal for a Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 639/2004 on the management of fishing fleets registered in the Community outermost regions C6-0295/2006.\nWho will speak on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries?\nRosa Migu\u00e9lez Ramos\n(ES) Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries in the absence of its chairman, Mr Morillon, in order to support this Council request for urgent procedure. We are talking about approving, as you have said, and as the Commission proposes, the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 639/2004 on the management of fishing fleets.\nThe fisheries sector in the outermost regions is suffering a structurally precarious situation. The Council's approval of the Regulation on the European Fisheries Fund was accompanied by a joint statement by the Council and the Commission in support of these regions, extending until 31 December 2006 the derogations regarding the possibility of granting State aid for the renewal of the fishing fleets registered in those regions.\nAlthough the extension ends in two months' time, the Regulation has not been able to enter into force due to the slow pace of the process for adopting decisions within Community legislation. Our committee is in favour of the urgent procedure and urges the Commission and the Member States to adopt the measures necessary to ensure that the sector can receive the aid without delay.\n(Parliament agreed to the urgent procedure)\nPresident\nThis item is therefore included in next Thursday's Voting Time at 11.30 a.m. and the time limit for presentation of amendments is tomorrow Wednesday at 10.00 a.m.\n", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nSmith\nMr President, concerning item No 10 on page 16 of the Minutes, Mr Novo raised the matter of the use of the bridge over rue Belliard to film a demonstration. The President said that he would reply in writing. It was a legitimate question and we are all entitled to hear the answer. If Parliament's premises are to be used by the goons and the ginks and the finks we are all entitled to know.\n\nPresident\nPerhaps the Minutes do not record the President's words accurately, Mr Smith. He asked Mr Novo to submit his observations to him in writing. Clearly, he could not give an immediate reply, and since he did not have direct knowledge of the events in question, he asked Mr Novo to make his point in writing, so that he could make the necessary inquiries and provide an answer as soon as possible.\n(Parliament approved the Minutes)\n\nCalendar of part-sessions\nPresident\nAt its meeting of 13 June, the Conference of Presidents decided to propose the following calendar of part-sessions for 1997:\n13 to 17 January; - 29 to 30 January; - 17 to 21 February; - 10 to 14 March; - 7 to 11 April; - 23 to 24 April; - 12 to 16 May; - 28 to 29 May; - 9 to 13 June; - 25 to 26 June; - 14 to 18 July; - 8 to 12 September; - 24 to 25 September; - 6 to 10 October; - 20 to 24 October; - 5 to 6 November; - 17 to 21 November; - 3 to 4 December; - 15 to 19 December.The deadline for tabling amendments to these dates is 5 p.m. on Wednesday, 3 July.\nThe vote will take place at 12 noon on Wednesday, 17 July.\n\nTomlinson\nMr President, am I correct in thinking you said that the deadline for tabling amendments would be Wednesday 3 July? That would be preposterous. It would be before we have a proper discussion in the main group meetings. You have to allow the full group meeting in the week before the plenary session so that groups can make decisions as to how they will vote.

Both of these countries are our partners under the European Neighbourhood Policy, and have been severely hit by the global economic and financial crisis of the last two years.\nIn the case of Georgia, the impact of the crisis has been exacerbated by the direct and indirect consequences of the military conflict that occurred last year with Russia, including a large number of people who were displaced within the country.\nThe economy of neighbouring Armenia has also been affected by the combination of the economic recession and, in particular, the rapid deterioration of", "12.

This will ensure the dignity of our House, which should not 'call on' or 'ask' an illegitimate de facto authority to behave better.\nIn making a reminder of the right of Moldovan citizens to vote, 'calls on' should be replaced by 'states that' and after 'Transnistria', 'have no right to prevent ...' should be inserted.\nPlease support this oral amendment.

When it comes to fundamental rights and freedoms, the EU must be able to speak with one voice, both at home and abroad. Amendment No 3 is therefore very important.\n", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 7 July 2000.\n\nStatement by the President\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, once again it is my sad duty to open our plenary sitting against the background of the violence in the Spanish Basque Country which has intensified dramatically over the summer. A further seven victims have been murdered by an organisation whose strategy is clearly, henceforth, one of attempting to defeat democracy by the use of terror.\nLet me give the names of the murder victims: Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Martin Carpena, a Popular Party municipal councillor in Malaga, whose widow and daughter are to visit the House tomorrow morning at 9 a.m.; Juan Mar\u00eda Jauregui, the former Civil Governor of Guipuzcoa; Jos\u00e9 Maria Korta, president of the Guipuzcoa employers' association; Francisco Casanova, a Second Lieutenant in the Spanish army; Irene Fern\u00e1ndez Pereda and Jos\u00e9 Angel de Jesus Encinas, members of the Guardia Civil in Sallent de Gallego; Manuel Indiano, Popular Party municipal councillor in Zumarraga.\nOn each of these sad occasions, I expressed our solidarity with the victims. I have expressed our condemnation of these unspeakably barbaric acts. I have also offered the Spanish authorities our support.\nToday, Parliament as a whole, unanimous in spite of the range of our political affiliations, is honouring their memory, affirming loudly and clearly that terrorism is the very antithesis of democracy. To deny the right to life is to kill liberty. Not only is violence a solution to be condemned, it is also inefficient, as it isolates and excludes the perpetrators of such actions.\nI propose a minute' s silence as a last tribute to these victims, as an expression of our support for their families and friends and, indeed, to all democratic men and women in Spain, and particularly in the Spanish Basque Country, who, despite the climate of terror, continue to believe in political dialogue, the fundamental v", "Voting time\nPresident\nThe next item is the vote.\nI have had a request from a number of Members, who have unavoidable commitments that will prevent them from being here for the whole of the vote, that the votes on Mr Van Orden's report on Bulgaria and Mr Moscovici's report on Romania be moved up the list. I therefore propose that we take the votes on the Bulgaria and Romania reports after the simplified procedure votes. Are there any objections to that change in the voting order?\nHannes Swoboda\n(DE) Mr President, there is, essentially, of course, no reason to move reports up the list simply because a few Members cannot be here, but Bulgaria, Romania, and their accession are of such importance that we can, by way of exception, agree to this.\n(Parliament agreed to the change in the voting order)\n(For the results and other details on the vote: see Minutes)\n", "1. Interpretation of Rule 19(1) (vote) \n- Before the vote\nNigel Farage\non behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I rise under Rule 170(4) to make the point that this proposal that we are being asked to vote on gives the President of this Parliament such arbitrary and dictatorial powers that no one who believes in democracy would ever even consider it. But to be asked to vote on it, when the political groups in this Parliament have not even had time to discuss it, surely cannot be right. So I ask that this vote be adjourned to the next part-session in Strasbourg so that people actually get a chance to understand the huge implications of this vote if it is passed.\nPresident\nMr Farage, firstly, you are entitled to ask for the matter to be adjourned. Nobody is questioning this right. We did briefly discuss the substance of the issue yesterday, however, after Mr Hannan asked for leave to speak. I would say to you very clearly that the substance of your statement, in which you refer to dictatorial measures, is inappropriate here. Accept the majority decision of this Parliament, accept the majority decision of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs! Everything here proceeds properly, according to the law, and you should be good democrats and accept it.\nMartin Schulz\non behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, our Group has discussed this issue very thoroughly. We believe that the President should consult the House once again prior to the decision, particularly with regard to how the revised version is worded, since accusations of authoritarian action are completely unjustified. Far from it! There is no reason at all in this regard to make use of wording as the last speaker has done. Please may we therefore proceed with the vote as you have proposed.\nPresident\nI was rather too quick. A formal proposal has been filed. One Member is able to speak in favour of the proposal and one against. We have listened to the speaker who is critical of the proposal. Someone in ", "Airport charges (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Stockmann, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on airport charges - C6-0056/2007 -.\nUlrich Stockmann\nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, of course it is always better when the Commissioner is present, as there are some critical points that I would like to put to him directly, but I will have to do this at a later time.\nFor more than 15 years we have been trying, or rather the Commission has been trying, to lay down a regulatory framework in the form of an EU directive on airport charges. Two attempts have already failed because of the conflict of interest between the airports and the airlines and between the different Member States. On this occasion, too, there was a great deal of conflict and I cannot recall a single one of the 189 amendments in committee that was generally accepted by all the parties involved.\nMany airlines want to see as much cost transparency as possible from the other side, the airports, and a regulatory authority that would ultimately set the prices, along with the introduction of the 'single till' system. Many airports would prefer no change whatsoever to the status quo. Moreover, the negotiations were also hampered by the structural particularities that exist in various Member States.\nThe United Kingdom, for example, already has a rigorous regulatory authority, the CAA, while at the same time most of the airports want to be deregulated and indeed the trend is in that direction. In Sweden, Portugal, Greece, Finland and Spain many of the airports are operated in a system of airport networks with standard airport charges, which means cross-subsidisation and often results in little transparency. In Spain airport charges are even laid down by Parliament, in other words the Members of Parliament decide on the levels that will apply. In Germany this area has been cont", "Council Question Time\nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B6-0316/2007).\nThe following questions are addressed to the Council.\nQuestion No 1 is inadmissible (Annex II, Part A, paragraph 2 of the Rules of Procedure).\nSubject: Prospects for the Galileo project\nThe Galileo project is an extremely important project for the European Union, as it is the result of space-related research and cooperation between the Member States and can be applied to numerous areas, including that of transport.\nGiven the current deadlock in the financing of this project, I should like to ask the Council of the European Union what measures it intends to take to resolve this situation and what kind of cooperation with third countries, such as India, does the European Union have in mind for this project?\nManuel Lobo Antunes\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) As the honourable Member knows, during its meeting from 6 to 8 June 2007 the Council analysed in depth the situation of the Galileo project and adopted a resolution. In this resolution, the Council invited the Commission to submit proposals on various aspects of the Galileo project. The Commission has since then adopted these proposals (on 19 November) and we now hope that the competent Council bodies will analyse these with a view to taking an integrated decision on the implementation of the Galileo project, including the public funding and modalities of public participation, before the end of this year.\nAs regards cooperation with third countries, it should be recalled that the Council attributes the greatest importance to cooperation with countries that do not belong to the European Union. Since 2001, as you know, various cooperation agreements in relation to Galileo have been signed with non-EU countries such as China, Israel and Ukraine. These countries are making contributions to the Galileo programme in terms of system definition, research and industrial cooperation.\nIn the specific case of India, a cooperation agreeme", "Formal sitting - Czech Republic\nPresident\n- Mr President of the Czech Republic, I would like to offer you a warm welcome to the European Parliament.\nV\u00e1clav Klaus\nPresident of the Czech Republic. - (CS) I would like first of all to thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak in the European Parliament, which is one of the key institutions of the European Union. Although I have been here several times before I have never had the chance to address a plenary session. I therefore appreciate the chance to do so today. The elected representatives of 27 countries with their broad spectrum of political opinions and views constitute a unique audience, just as the European Union itself has been a unique and essentially revolutionary experiment for over half a century, attempting to improve decision making in Europe through transferring a significant part of the decision-making process from individual states to pan-European institutions.\nI have travelled here to see you from Prague, the capital city of the Czech Republic, the historic heart of Czech statehood and an important place in the development of European ideas, European culture and European civilisation. I have come here as the representative of the Czech state, which in its various forms has always been part of European history, a country which has often played a direct and significant role in the making of European history and which wishes to continue doing so.\nThe last time a Czech president addressed you from this place was nine years ago. He was my predecessor in the role, V\u00e1clav Havel, and it was four years before our accession to the EU. Some weeks ago, the Czech premier, Mirek Topol\u00e1nek, also spoke here, this time as the leader of the country holding the presidency of the Council of the EU. In his speech he focused on specific topics arising from the priorities of the Czech presidency and the problems currently confronting the countries of the European Union.\nThis enables me to approach you with themes of a", "Databases relating to racial and ethnic origin in the EU (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on:\nthe oral question to the Commission by Monika Fla\u0161\u00edkov\u00e1 Be\u0148ov\u00e1, Claude Moraes, Kinga G\u00f6ncz and Sylvie Guillaume, on behalf of the S&D Group, on databases relating to racial and ethnic origin in the EU - B7-0553/2010),\nthe oral question to the Commission by H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Flautre, Ra\u00fcl Romeva i Rueda and Judith Sargentini, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on databases relating to racial and ethnic origin in the EU - B7-0554/2010),\nthe oral question to the Commission by Renate Weber, Nathalie Griesbeck, Sophia in 't Veld, Sonia Alfano, Cecilia Wikstr\u00f6m, Louis Michel, Sarah Ludford, Gianni Vattimo, Leonidas Donskis, Alexander Alvaro, Niccol\u00f2 Rinaldi, Ramon Tremosa i Balcells, Metin Kazak and Marielle De Sarnez, on behalf of the ALDE Group, on databases relating to racial and ethnic origin in the EU - B7-0556/2010), and\nthe oral question to the Commission by Rui Tavares, Cornelia Ernst, Marie-Christine Vergiat, Cornelis de Jong, Nikolaos Chountis, Marisa Matias and Eva-Britt Svensson, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on Roma databases and discrimination - B7-0557/2010).\nMonika Fla\u0161\u00edkov\u00e1 Be\u0148ov\u00e1\nAccording to recent media information, the French police are using the MINS database which focuses on Roma and travellers.\nNon-governmental organisations have submitted complaints relating to the creation of illegal and secret databases for storing personal information in connection with racial and ethnic origins, and have stated that they are appealing to the relevant authorities. The French authorities, however, deny the existence of such a database. The Minister for Immigration has previously declared that biometric data on the deported Roma may be retained in the OSCAR database and in a new database that is under construction. It is said that even the Netherlands and other countries of the European Union are registering data on ethnic and racial origin.

This was largely unjustified as we needed to give the Treaty of Amsterdam a chance.\nWe are ending the Luxembourg Presidency, not in an atmosphere of boundless enthusiasm, but at least in an atmosphere which has become more objective and hardworking. This objectivity is the result of our capacity to show that we know how to remain faithful to our long term ambitions and to those, even older, which we entered into by adopting and ratifying the Maastricht Treaty. We have proved that we were able to make a start on new ambitions in order to bring about new horizons. We wanted to make the European project more complete, to give it its due scope. We have done this through the conclusions adopted on 21 November 1997, at the employment summit.\nI told you in October in this very Chamber that this summit could not become one of excessive deregulation, nor even of paraphrase. I believe I can say that we have kept our word on this point - and on others - since the European summit on employment adopted concrete decisions, quantifiable and costed wherever possible.\nOn leaving Amsterdam", "1.

It is a good sign that we are today voting to make the year 2012 the European Year for Active Ageing and for solidarity between generations, and we will also duly celebrate it and present it to the public. At this point, I would like to thank the Commission, the Council and the shadow rapporteurs most sincerely for the fact that we were able to reach a compromise together at first reading, and this is the compromise that we are presenting here today and will jointly adopt.\nI would like to refer you to an amendment that I would ask you to support. A European Year also requires a certain amount of publicity and for that we also need money. We have fought for a budget line for this so that a certain amount is available in order to present to the public the subject of solidarity between generations as well as the subject of active ageing. Thank you very much and I would ask for your support.\n(Applause)\n", "An Integrated Maritime Policy for the European Union (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Piecyk, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on an integrated maritime policy for the European Union.\nWilli Piecyk\nMadam President, I am pleased that you are in the chair for a second time for a debate on maritime policy. You were also there a year ago.\nCommissioner, let us start with the good news. This evening the first European Maritime Day event will be taking place in St James's Church in L\u00fcbeck. This church houses the international memorial for civil maritime navigation. Commissioner Barrot opened it last year. Captains will be discussing their living and working conditions there this evening. The pastors have been relying upon the Presidents of Parliament, the Council and the Commission to actually declare 20 May European Maritime Day this afternoon. This is a reason to rejoice and it should cause Europe to pay more attention to its seas.\nOnly those who believe that a day such as this is also in fact maritime policy are indeed mistaken; a Maritime Day such as this should not degenerate into mere symbolism. That means it must be part of a political framework. Policy is required - for social matters, maritime safety and climate protection. Let us take living and working conditions on board ships: it is an evil anachronism that a whole range of social and employment protection regulations do not apply to seafarers. This has to change and the Commission also sees that it has to change. We await their initiatives here.\nThe International Labour Organization adopted the Maritime Labour Convention in 2006. Three States have so far ratified it: the Bahamas, Liberia and the Marshall Islands. Where do Europeans actually stand here? If the Council wants to improve navigational and maritime safety, it simply has to do one thing: finally adopt the Erika III package. It is a bit much that the Council is dealing with this issue of maritime safety in such", "Eurovignette (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the oral question to the Commission by Paolo Costa on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, concerning Eurovignette - B6-0386/2007).\nSilvia-Adriana \u0162ic\u0103u\nsubstitute of the author. - (RO) Madam President, the subject we are discussing is a requirement that the Committee on Transport has had for some time and which it submitted to the European Commission in order to present a model for internalization of external costs, applicable to all modes of transport. In fact, I requested the Commission to present, by June 2008 at the latest, after examining all options - including of costs related to environmental protection, noise, congestions and health - a generally applicable model, transparent and comprehensive, for assessing all external costs, which would define and act as a basis for the subsequent calculation of charges for using infrastructures.\nBased upon the intermediate results obtained in developing this model, the Commission should indicate whether the global environmental costs, such as the costs related to climate changes and the recently published costs, related to health, are examined in the intermediate report and if they shall be taken into consideration as a substantial factor in the subsequent assessment and calculations.\nI would like to mention the fact that the directive we refer to offers the possibility to the Member States to introduce a road tax and, for its calculation, to take into account more cost elements than before. In fact, there is a discussion regarding the inclusion of the so-called external costs, such as those related to environment, into the road fee.\nMany Member States are against the introduction of such costs into the road tax, because they think that there is no sustainable model for this calculation, but other countries believe that these taxes will generate income and that, in this way, the necessary funds for developing infrastructure will be created.\nI would also wan", "3. European Aviation Safety Agency (vote) \n- Before the vote:\nJ\u00f6rg Leichtfried \nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, I just wanted to say something about the translation of Amendment 10, which has to do with Article 1, point 5 of Article 6b, paragraph 4, and where it appears that an error crept into the final report for voting in plenary through the transmission of the committee's vote. In the original document, the amendment reads - and I shall quote it in English:\n'those involved in commercial operations shall hold an attestation as referred to in'\n(DE) but the text adopted by the committee reads:\n'those involved in commercial operations shall hold an attestation as initially described in'\n(DE) and so on, and I ask that this be taken into account.\n(Parliament agreed to the request)\n- Before the vote on Annex II:\nJarom\u00edr Kohl\u00ed\u010dek\n(CS) Mr President, on transcription, one line appears to have been mistakenly omitted from paragraph E of Annex II, namely part 7, and I quote, '600 kg for ultralight aircraft for non-commercial use'.\n(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)\n", "Trade in seal products (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Wallis, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning trade in seal products - C6-0295/2008 -.\nDiana Wallis\nrapporteur. - Madam President, we have a compromise; we possibly have before us tomorrow a first-reading agreement. For my part, as rapporteur in this Parliament, I would say that this has been a very difficult file, a very difficult journey.\nHowever, we have arrived at a position where, I hope, we will respect the wishes of those Members of Parliament who signed the written declaration on this subject and we will have respected the wishes of many citizens in many of our countries across the EU who tell us that they do not like what they see of the commercial seal hunt and that they wish to have no association with the trade that results from that hunt. We have respected that wish; we have dealt solely with what we can deal with within the confines of Europe's internal market: the circulation of goods in the market that arise from the commercial hunt. Following this piece of legislation - if it goes through tomorrow - our consumers should be assured that nothing from the commercial hunt will be sold on Europe's market.\nBut, of course, there are exceptions. Seals are very beautiful marine animals - in fact, I have realised during this process that they have great PR - but to some they are the rats of the sea. That is how they are perceived by many fishermen: an adult seal gets through an enormous amount of fish on a daily basis. Therefore, there will remain the need for seals to be hunted to ensure the sustainability of fisheries in some area.\nBut what we have not done here is to regulate hunting. If people in any of our Member States wish to hunt, they can still continue to hunt. What they cannot do is take commercial gain from the results of that hunt. But it should", "Commission Question Time\nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B6-0437/2006).\nThe following questions have been submitted to the Commission.\nPart One\nSubject: Airline overbooking\nBearing in mind Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 on Air Passengers' Rights, will the Commission consider doing more to discourage the practice of overbooking by airlines?\nJacques Barrot\nMr President, the Commission currently receives fewer complaints about overbooking than before the compensation levels were raised by Regulation (EC) No 261/2004. At the present time, only 8% of the complaints received by the Commission concerning air passengers' rights relate to instances of overbooking or denied boarding, while 60% refer to delays or cancellations. This trend is due, among other things, to the development of low-cost carriers and to the increasingly frequent use of charter companies, which do not tend to integrate overbooking into their working methods.\nSince this regulation entered into force, the airlines have demonstrated more flexibility in looking for volunteers who will agree to give up their seats in return for certain agreed benefits. This practice encourages the airlines to resolve the problem there and then.\nThat being said, I should like to point out to Mr Evans that, in accordance with Article 17 of the regulation, the Commission is going to present a report on the functioning and application of this regulation to Parliament and the Council at the start of 2007. This communication will be based on a study carried out by an external consultant. An invitation to tender has been published for the purposes of recruiting this external consultant.\nOverbooking is one of the items that will be dealt with in this study, and the Commission will obviously wait to learn the results of the study before it decides whether or not there are grounds to adapt the legislation. The fact is, Mr Evans, while these new regulations have indeed had a noticeable effect on passengers' rights, it is the de", "Formation of political groups (amendment of Rule 29) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Corbett, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on amendment of Rule 29 of Parliament's Rules of Procedure - Formation of political groups.\nRichard Corbett\nrapporteur. - Mr President, I rise to present to you a report from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs concerning our Rules, where we have examined the question of the threshold - the minimum threshold necessary to constitute a political group in our Parliament.\nAll parliaments that have a system of political groups have, of course, a minimum threshold. Normally one does not allow a single Member or two Members to create a political group; it is necessary always to define what that threshold should be. And, as our Parliament continues to grow, it is logical that we pause to reflect and think what should be, in the next Parliament, the threshold for creating a political group.\nWe have looked at this in detail in the Constitutional Committee, and the committee's opinions were fairly evenly divided. There was a majority of one vote against raising the threshold when we looked at it in committee, although, of course, this matter is now before us again in the House.\nWe also looked at groups that exist already but fall slightly below the threshold when one or two members leave and whether it is right that such groups should automatically and immediately cease to exist or whether in some circumstances we should allow such groups to continue to exist. Here the committee approved my proposal, which was based on a suggestion of Mr Bonde, the former co-leader of the IND/DEM Group, who pointed out to me what difficulties he, as a group leader, could face, leading a group that was just above the threshold, when one, two or three Members might threaten to leave the group unless they got their way on something or other, thereby effectively blackmailing the group.\nOn his suggestion, the committee wisely a", "24. Capital requirements (implementation plan) (\n- Before the vote\nOthmar Karas\n(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to say that Parliament will vote for the first time today within the framework of the new regulatory procedure with scrutiny on whether to reject a Commission legislative proposal. As rapporteur for the Capital Requirements Directive which forms the background to this vote, I would ask you to support the motion for a resolution, which was unanimously adopted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.\nThis will allow the European Parliament to send a clear signal to the Commission. We are demanding an appropriate balance between matters which are proposed by the Commission in the codecision procedure and matters which are handled by the Commission alone within the comitology procedure.\nThe Commission has made concrete proposals within the comitology procedure relating to credit rating agencies which go far beyond the technical aspects and therefore need to be returned to the codecision procedure.\nWe must ensure that we issue coherent legislation. We currently have in front of us the reports on the rating agencies and on the Capital Requirements Directive and one comitology proposal. Our aim is to discuss everything jointly in the codecision procedure with a clear focus and therefore I ask you for your support.\n(Applause)\n", "Safety on the Community's railways - Amendment of Regulation (EC) No 881/2004 establishing a European Railway Agency (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on\n- the recommendation for second reading by Paolo Costa, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on amending Directive 2004/49/EC on safety on the Community's railways (Railway Safety Directive) (16133/3/2007 - C6-0129/2008 -;\n- the recommendation for second reading by Paolo Costa, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism , on amending Regulation (EC) No 881/2004 establishing a European Railway Agency (Agency Regulation) (16138/3/2007 - C6-0131/2008 -\nPaolo Costa\nrapporteur. - (IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure for me to introduce our debate this evening, because we have reached the end of an endeavour which was initially very difficult but whose outcome, it seems to me, is highly significant. We are discussing some very technical matters this evening, but in my opinion they are ones which will make a much more significant contribution to building Europe than many of the speeches we address to one another on so many other occasions.\nWe may not have noticed, but there are now almost 700 000 wagons in Europe which are able to move from one country to another and can be used by one company rather than another; until now, however, they have been prevented from crossing borders with relative ease because we had not established common safety rules on both sides.\nThis evening, by tackling two issues that complement the rules on interoperability and on the mutual recognition of rolling stock, already carried forward in January, we are eliminating other barriers, and doing so in such a way as to ensure that there is a harmonised system, not least from a safety point of view. With the regulation under discussion this evening, we are taking a second step forward: as well as extending the powers of the European Agency, we are giving it a c", "36. Interim Trade Agreement with Turkmenistan\n- Before the vote:\nKarel Schwarzenberg\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, let me remind you that the Council has always examined the opinions and resolutions of Parliament with great interest and attention. At the same time, the Council has taken the issue of human rights very seriously, as evidenced in the contractual relations of the European Union with countries in various parts of the world.\nUnder the Cotonou Agreement, a treaty between the European Union and the group of African, Caribbean and Pacific States, there have been more than 15 cases since 1995 when the Community has partially or fully suspended the application of agreements in relation to some of the countries for non-execution of obligations relating to the human rights clause.\nYou will certainly also know about the sanctions the Council imposed on Uzbekistan following the Andijan events in 2005. Of course, much remains to be done in the field of human rights and respect for the rule of law and democracy in Turkmenistan.\nWe will continue to push, in particular, for the release of all political prisoners, for free access of the International Committee of the Red Cross to prisons, for lifting of the restrictions on foreign travel and for freedom of the media in civil society. We are committed to taking appropriate measures in conformity with the agreement, including, if necessary, the suspension of the agreement with Turkmenistan, in case of a violation of human rights, as stipulated in the agreement.\nCharlie McCreevy\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission has carefully taken note of Parliament's concerns about the democracy and human rights situation in Turkmenistan. We welcome the statement in the joint draft resolution that the conclusion of an interim trade agreement would be a good first step that will allow us to engage more with Turkmenistan in order to promote further positive developments and cooperation.\nThe Com", "Tribute\nPresident\nI must begin this sitting by passing on some bad news. Firstly, it is my sad duty to inform you of the death of Mr Antoni Guti\u00e9rrez D\u00edaz, who was a Member of the European Parliament for many years, from 1987 to 1999.\nAs you are very well aware as am I, since I got to know him very well within the context of Spanish political life he was a member of the Communist Group and then the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, of which he was Vice-President from 1992 to 1994.\nMr Guti\u00e9rrez D\u00edaz was also Vice-President of our Parliament from 1994 to 1999 and President of the Committee on Regional Policy, Regional Planning and Relations with Regional and Local Authorities from 1992 to 1994.\nTo those of us who knew him, his death is a great tragedy. I believe that political life has lost one of its best representatives.\nI would ask that we observe a minute's silence in memory of our late colleague.\n(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)\n", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nFalconer\nMr President, yesterday I raised a point regarding a camera stationed outside the Chamber with its light peering in through one of the doors. In addition to this, I was proceeding along the corridor yesterday afternoon when a cameraman was walking backwards filming a Member of this House. Not only was this a hazard to the cameraman's life and limb but it was also a hazard to any Member's life and limb.\nI would ask the House and you, Mr President, as I know you treat this place with some dignity - much more than I do on occasions - to investigate these matters and perhaps advise us how these practices can be stopped.\n\nPresident\nThank you for informing us of this, Mr Falconer. Fortunately, this practice of walking backwards is not one that has been widely adopted either by Members or officials, but we shall look into what was going on.\n\nPosselt\nMr President, on a point of order relating to Rule 41(1), we obviously had a linguistic misunderstanding on Monday. So I have to raise this matter again. On Monday, I objected to the deletion of Question Time to the Council from today's agenda. You said the agenda was adopted as it stood because no group had objected. But it says in our Rules of Procedure: 'Question Time to the Council and Commission shall be held at each part-session'. I wish to make that point. I believe we must observe the Rules of Procedure, even if not a single group has objected to the agenda.\n\nPresident\nMr Posselt, this issue always raises problems because the Rules of Procedure also state that Question Time shall be held at such times as may be decided by Parliament on a proposal from the Conference of Presidents. If the proposal from the Conference of Presidents is that it should not take place - and this is not the first time that this has happened, since it has unfortunately happened on a number of occasions -, then I cannot g", "Specific measures for agricultural markets (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Paolo De Castro, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on specific measures for agricultural markets - B7-0208/2010).\nAs Mr De Castro is not present, Mr Le Foll, who is replacing Mr De Castro, has the floor.\nSt\u00e9phane Le Foll\nMr President, it therefore falls to us to close these debates this evening, and it is already late. I would like, first of all, to excuse the Chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr De Castro, who is unable to be here with us this evening for reasons that you know. Like other Members of this House, he has been unable to leave his country to come and participate in our debates in Strasbourg.\nThe issue with which we are concerned results from the general crisis being experienced by the entire agricultural sector. As we know today, we are experiencing a crisis and, above all, seeing a fall in prices and agricultural revenues that is affecting cereal producers, livestock producers, whether pork or beef producers, and also - and I say this on behalf of Mr De Castro - olive oil producers, and which is hitting and has hit dairy producers extremely hard.\nFaced with this crisis and this price fall, it goes without saying that Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wishes to find out from the Commission what we can do right now and in the future to escape this crisis and, above all, what measures could be adopted in the coming months to support farmers and to ensure that the agricultural markets are less volatile.\nThe first question that I would like to ask the Commissioner is more specifically about the dairy crisis: what is the situation with regard to the measures adopted by Parliament and the Council concerning this dairy crisis and, in particular, to the application of the famous EUR 300 million milk fund that had been agreed? That is the first ques", "Draft Commission Regulation on REACH, as regards Annex XVII (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Mr Ouzk\u00fd and Mr Sacconi, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the draft Commission Regulation on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), as regards Annex XVII - B6-0230/2009).\nGuido Sacconi\nauthor. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our debate today is particularly important, as we know, for two reasons: firstly, because we are talking about one of the substances that has caused most harm and deaths among citizens and workers at the plants where it is used and produced, namely asbestos. Secondly, because we are debating one of the first measures to implement the extremely significant regulation that has, in a way, marked this parliamentary term, that is to say REACH.\nWith the question we have asked and the draft resolution we will vote on today - let me say straight away to reassure the Commission and Vice-President Tajani who is here on its behalf - we are not opposing the draft implementing regulation that the Commission has adopted on this issue. I refer to Point 2.6 of this draft measure, which provides the missing Annex 17 that should have reproduced the provisions of Annex 1 of Directive 76 - the directive on dangerous substances, which will be replaced by REACH, and therefore repealed - this Point 2.6 extends the ban on the placing on the market of asbestos fibres and products containing asbestos.\nThe truth is that in this same decision, however, there are exemptions, to be granted by certain Member States - for the record, there are four of them - who may keep articles marketed before 2005 on the market, as well as diaphragms containing chrysotile asbestos used in production at existing electrolysis plants. The possibility of using these exemptions is of course subject to the Member States' compliance with all the Comm", "Public Finances in the EMU 2006 (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Lauk, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on Public Finances in EMU 2006.\nI would point out that Mr Schwab is standing in for the rapporteur.\nAndreas Schwab \ndeputy rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, at this late hour, I am pleased that we are speaking about the economic and monetary union of the EU. The European Parliament, in this report presented on its own initiative, expresses itself for the first time on the revised version of the Stability and Growth Pact, adopted by the Heads of State or Government in March 2005. The revision concerned both the preventive and the remedial elements of the Pact.\nThe aim of the Pact was and remains the avoidance of an excessive deficit and the achievement in the medium and long term of a balanced budget and sound public finances. The present report is an appraisal based on one year. The reference period, in other words, is very short - too short, in fact; moreover, it covers the year 2006, a year characterised by very favourable economic trends. These trends had a beneficial impact on the fiscal policies of the Member States. It goes without saying that an assessment based entirely on this brief period cannot be the last word. The real endurance test for the revised Pact awaits us in the coming years.\nThe report is an appraisal of the current situation. The rapporteur, Kurt Joachim Lauk, who unfortunately cannot be with us this evening, has deliberately avoided naming the various Member States and assessing their individual levels of performance. The point of this report was not to award exam marks; the rapporteur saw no value in that approach. What the report can usefully do is to make a general assessment of achievements to date.\nThe Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has dealt in great depth with this report, and our exchanges were highly constructive and fruitful. On behalf of Mr Lauk, may I off", "3. (\n- Before the vote:\nMarie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou\n(EL) Mr President, my dear colleagues, as we know, the European Commission's original proposal included in a single Regulation the amended proposal for Regulation No 11 abolishing discrimination in prices and terms of transport, and the amendment to Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs.\nThe Commission's proposal was based on Articles 75, 152 and 95 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, and the stipulated procedure for adopting the Resolution was co-decision. The colegislators - Council and Parliament - decided to split the original proposal into two separate Regulations: one for the amendment of Regulation No 11 on transport, based on Article 75 (3), which does not provide for any intervention by the European Parliament in the legislative procedure, and on which the Committee on Transport gave its opinion; and another Regulation concerning amendment of the Regulation on the hygiene of foodstuffs, based on Articles 95 and 152 (4b), on which the Committee on the Environment is to give its opinion shortly. Today we are called upon to decide whether Article 75 (3) provides an adequate legal basis for amending the Regulation on transport. The amendment to Article 852/2004, as we have said, will be discussed later.\nThe proposed Regulation which is submitted today provides for the deletion of Article 5, which ceased to be valid in 1961, and an amendment to Article 6, aimed at reducing the carriers' administrative obligations by abolishing their obligation to retain copies showing full price information, since this information is included anyway on the consignment notes and in the carriers' accounting systems. This amendment makes it possible to check transport rates and conditions, and identify any discrimination. So this is an amendment that corresponds exactly to what is provided for in Article 75 (3), second sentence, of the Treaty of the European Communities, and since the amendment", "Inclusion of aviation activities in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community (debate) \nPresident\n\u03a4he next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Peter Liese and Mathieu Grosch, on behalf of the PPE Group, Sa\u00efd El Khadraoui, Kathleen Van Brempt and Matthias Groote, on behalf of the S&D Group, Chris Davies and Holger Krahmer, on behalf of the ALDE Group, Martin Callanan, on behalf of the ECR Group, and Satu Hassi, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on aviation activities in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community - B7-0463/2010).\nPeter Liese\nMadam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in 2008 - following intense negotiations - we resolved to include aviation in the emissions trading system. I was the rapporteur at the time, and some of the shadow rapporteurs are also present here. We did not do it to annoy the aviation industry or third countries; we did it because we have a major problem. There has been a dramatic rise in greenhouse gases, and emissions of greenhouse gases from aviation have doubled since 1990. In 1997, the global community delegated the task of reducing these greenhouse gases to ICAO in the Kyoto Protocol. I regret to say that ICAO has produced no concrete results to date.\nWe felt that it was important when drafting legislation to include all airlines that take off or land in Europe. Whether they are European airlines, US airlines or Chinese airlines makes no difference; all must be included. That is important for the climate, and naturally it is also important from the point of view of fair competition. All this was approved in the codecision and Parliament made great compromises compared with its original proposals. It is therefore important to communicate this to third countries. The compromises cannot be easily changed because they were agreed in the codecision procedure.\nNaturally there was already resistance at that time from third countrie", "The CAP towards 2020: Meeting the food, natural resources and territorial challenges of the future (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Dess, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the CAP towards 2020: meeting the food, natural resources and territorial challenges of the future.\nAlbert De\u00df\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 50 years ago, in 1961, I began my training to be a farmer. Ever since then, I have been guided by the common European agricultural policy. It has become an important mainstay of the European unification process.\nSince the beginning of the CAP there have been fundamental changes to its tasks. The first task was to increase food production in order for us to be less dependent on food imports. Sometime later, Europe was in the position of having to deal with food surpluses. With an ever-changing situation, there were also more and more reforms.\nToday, we are debating the next reform, the new approach of the CAP after 2013. As rapporteur for the CAP reform towards 2020, I am pleased that we have achieved a cross-group compromise. Even if not all of the individual interests could be taken into account in a compromise, the report was adopted with a large majority in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. The clear vote is an unambiguous signal to the Commission of the form that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development sees the CAP taking towards 2020. I am certain, Commissioner, that the new approach of the CAP after 2013 will also bear the stamp of the European Parliament. The Treaty of Lisbon gives us that possibility.\nMy thanks today go to my fellow Members for their involvement and support, and to the committee chair Mr De Castro, the coordinators and the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation and willingness to compromise. I would like to thank the staff of the committee secretariat, the political groups and in my own private office for their splendid ", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 12 March 1999.\n\nApproval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of the sitting of Friday, 12 March 1999 have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nBar\u00f3n Crespo\nMr President, I would remind the House of the recent death of Yehudi Menuhin in Berlin on 12 March. Berlin was the scene of his rise to fame and it was to Berlin that he returned in 1945 to promote dialogue with the German people. He was the first Jewish person to do so. Yehudi Menuhin made a conscious decision to become a European. He supported those who fought for freedom in the Soviet Union and was the first to put forward in the Knesset the notion of an Israeli-Palestinian confederation. He conducted the peace concert in Sarajevo, and worked to ensure that culture and the development of culture featured in our Treaties. He also cooperated with Parliament and with the Commission to develop the MUS-Europe programme. To date, this programme has enabled over 3 000 children from underprivileged and marginalised areas of the European Union to learn music, mime and movement, as part of education for tolerance.\nMr President, I think we owe something to this self-professed European and British citizen. I am not calling for a minute's silence simply because I believe Yehudi Menuhin himself would have wished our debates to continue as planned. I appreciate that today is a difficult day, but I do feel that the House should pay tribute to the memory of Yehudi Menuhin.\nLoud applause\n\nPresident\nThank you, Mr Bar\u00f3n. I think the applause indicates that the House supports your views, and they will be passed on as appropriate.\n\nR\u00fcbig\nMr President, I should like to inform you that a few days ago in the rue Wirtz, a woman was raped and then murdered, and I support your efforts to secure the establishment of a police station, which is urgently needed and would be greatly welcomed by those who live and work in th", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nZuzana Roithov\u00e1\n- (CS) Mr President, the extent of the financial crisis shows that neither banks nor consumers have been taking responsible decisions. I am strongly in favour of investing in financial education and I have also approved the report, but I cannot agree with superficial campaigns and general principles. I am concerned that we have analysis as the situation may vary between the Member States. I also know that the education must be narrowly focused on the specific requirements of a range of different groups of citizens in order to be really effective.\nI would like to bring to your attention some exemplary practice from the Czech Republic. For the last three years a single person has been running a website called www.bankovnipoplatky.com. This website makes a vital contribution to the financial education of those Czech citizens who are on the internet. This shows that this issue can be solved cheaply and effectively. What is missing, however, is education for schoolchildren and the older generation and we will not manage this without public funding.\nZita Ple\u0161tinsk\u00e1\n- (SK) The financial crisis has provided European consumers with an excellent opportunity to check their knowledge of financial matters. They have been given a wonderful lesson in the importance of their understanding of personal finance, in savings assessment, in the use of insurance products, and in reading of ordinary bank statements and receipts. All these subjects require a knowledge of financial terminology and its correct application in the management of their finances.\nFor this reason I consider the report from the rapporteur Mrs Iotova to be a further important contribution from the EP in the area of consumer protection and I have voted in its favour. I firmly believe that the education of consumers must begin in primary school. The Member States should include this topic, especially finance, in textbooks of primary and secondary schools. T", "Joint removals of irregular migrants to Afghanistan and other third countries (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statements from the Council and Commission on the joint removals of irregular migrants to Afghanistan and other third countries.\nTobias Billstr\u00f6m\nMr President, honourable Members, I would like to begin by thanking you for the opportunity to come here today to debate this important issue. Judging by the questions that have been raised by some Members, it is clear that this is an issue that gives rise to a certain amount of concern. I hope that I can clarify the Council's view on this matter today and answer your questions.\nThe rule of law and respect for human rights and the fundamental freedoms are fundamental principles for cooperation within the European Union. They must be the guiding principles for the Member States' cooperation within the Union. These principles are, and must also continue to be, the starting point for cooperation in the area of asylum and migration.\nThe EU's cooperation in the area of migration has developed quickly over the last few years and includes a number of different legislative acts and other types of measures. With regard to the rights of asylum seekers, I would like to draw your attention to the basic aim of cooperation on asylum. The goal of this work is to create a common European asylum system that will provide people with protection in accordance with the Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees and other international treaties relating to people in need of protection. Within the framework of this cooperation, there are provisions for being able to offer subsidiary protection and provisions relating to the asylum procedure, reception and return. The provisions cover the whole asylum area and form the basis of the common European asylum system.\nThe key legislative acts in the area of asylum are the Dublin Regulation establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible f", "Composition of political groups\nPresident\nI would like to inform you that Mr Claudiu Ciprian T\u0103n\u0103sescu joined the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament with effect from 15 November 2010.\nI would also like to inform you that Mr Pino Arlacchi joined the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament with effect from 18 November 2010.\n", "4. Common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals (\n- After the vote on Amendment 74:\nKonrad Szyma\u0144ski\n(PL) I should like to draw your attention to the fact that some Members on the left of the Chamber are displaying banners. We were informed this morning that holding up banners on the right of the Chamber contravened our procedures.\nPresident\nIn principle, anything that does not directly disrupt our work does not have to be banned, but if the House thinks that these placards are disrupting the work... Well, I do not think that there is a majority that considers itself to be disrupted. We shall therefore continue.\n", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nGreen\nMadam President, I should like to raise a point which I think is of enormous concern to the people of the European Union and that is the reports which have come out this morning about the decision by the British Government last night to end the cull of British cattle believed or suspected to be infected with BSE. It is a very serious concern and you will know the enormous impact this will have on the fears of the European people about their public health and consumer safety.\nI would like to ask the European Commission immediately to respond as to how they are going to react to the action taken by the British Government, which seems to be a complete about-turn on the action plan that was presented by the British Prime Minister to the European Council when it last met.\n\nPresident\nMrs Green, it is quite obvious that we cannot just improvise a debate like that. What I would suggest - if the Commission agrees, of course - is that any comment by the Commission on this matter could be made in connection with Mr Funk's report, which appears on this morning's agenda. It might well be possible for this question to be brought in in connection with that report, but you must surely understand that we cannot just improvise a debate like that at the start of the sitting.\nI am now going to give the floor to Mr Poettering, who will tell me whether he agrees with my suggestion.\n\nPoettering\nMadam President, what Pauline Green has suggested in her capacity as President of the PSE Group also reflects the view of the PPE Group. This is a very serious matter, and we must take note of it. What is at issue here is not just health but the community of law that is the European Union - once a legal decision has been made, no Member State can unilaterally revoke it. We support your suggestion, Madam President, that the Commission should make a statement on this in connectio", "Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system - Investigation of accidents in the maritime transport sector - The liability of carriers of passengers by sea in the event of an accident - Port State control (recast) - Ship inspection and survey organisations (Directive recast) - Ship inspection and survey organisations (Regulation recast) (continuation of debate) \nGilles Savary\nMr President, since I became a shadow rapporteur when the Council swept away my report, I have only two minutes to speak. I will therefore cut to the chase, firstly to say that I am not addressing the French Presidency, which is supporting us, or the Commissioner, who is supporting us, but the Council. I am also addressing my fellow Members to thank them for their solidarity, and to say that the Erika and the Prestige were very bad experiences. The Member States have accused Europe of not doing enough about them.\nNow, thanks to Commissioner Barrot, we are attempting to establish, from scratch, an honourable European maritime transport space. One of the measures we are proposing is shipowners' civil liability. What does that mean? It means that, at the very least, we are ensuring that all vessels are insured by solvent insurance companies for the damage they cause, at least within the framework of the IMO conventions. In La Rochelle I was pleased to see Member States who had not joined the IMO suddenly becoming ardent fans of the organisation.\nMy advice to them is to ratify the IMO conventions, starting with the one on chemicals. There could be a chemical hazard, a chemical disaster, today, or tomorrow morning. We would be transported back to the time of the Exxon Valdez. Practically no Member States have made a legal commitment as regards chemical hazards with the IMO. That is the first thing.\nThe second is to create a guarantee and insurance certificate for the European maritime transport space. We need to have confidence in Europe. When it forges ahead, it takes the world with i", "Preparation for the European Council (14-15 December 2006) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on the preparation for the European Council on 14-15 December, that is to say, starting tomorrow.\nPaula Lehtom\u00e4ki\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for this opportunity to discuss here in Parliament beforehand the European Council meeting to be held on 14 and 15 December. The main themes at the summit that convenes tomorrow will be enlargement, more effective decision-making in justice and home affairs, and immigration policy.\nThe Heads of State or Government will hold an in-depth debate in the European Council on how to take the EU's enlargement process forward. The Presidency has a clear mandate from the June European Council to hold this debate. The enlargement strategy made public on 8 November, and the in-depth discussion in the General Affairs and External Relations Council on Monday, will provide a sound basis for the European Council discussions.\nAs I stated here this morning, the aim of the enlargement debate is to consolidate the commitments that we have now made to Croatia and Turkey, who are now engaged in membership negotiations, and to the countries of the Western Balkans.\nIt is our intention that the outcome of the European Council's enlargement debate should result in a renewed agreement by the Member States on the future of enlargement. It will be based on the Commission's enlargement strategy: keeping to commitments on conditionality and better communications. At the same time, attention must also be paid to the EU's capacity to accept new members.\nEnlargement is not the only topic of major importance to the future of the Union to be discussed at the summit starting tomorrow. Over dinner, Prime Minister Vanhanen will give his colleagues his assessment of the confidential consultations which have been held during our Presidency on the future of the Constitutional Treaty. He will also present the most impor", "Formal sitting - Award of the 2006 Sakharov Prize\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, it is a great pleasure for the European Parliament to receive the winner of the 2006 Sakharov Prize, Mr Milinkievitch, leader of the opposition United Democratic Forces in Belarus.\nPlease believe me, Mr Milinkievitch, when I say that we are particularly happy to have you here with us today.\n(Applause)\nThere have been times when we thought that you would not be able to come. Our Sakharov Prize winners have often been unable to come here to receive the prize. Aung San Suu Kyi, Wei Jingsheng and the Women in White have regrettably been unable to attend this ceremony.\nWe should remember that we Europeans, at home in our consolidated democracies, often take human rights for granted, seeing them as something natural and indisputable, like the air we breathe. We enjoy our political and civil freedoms, sometimes forgetting what it costs to obtain them and accustomed to exercising them. We become accustomed to good things very quickly, and even countries that have obtained freedom later enjoy it as if they have always had it and as if everybody had it.\nWe must remember, however, that billions of people on our planet lack the freedom that we enjoy.\nOur Union is based on respect for human rights, and defending them and promoting them around the world is part of our raison d'\u00eatre. Not just for moral reasons, but also in our own interest. In terms of Europe's interests, it is a priority that our freedom should be exercised by the whole of humanity.\nThe Sakharov Prize is therefore an expression of the European Union's defence of and commitment to human rights, and this year it is being awarded to a person who is dedicating his life to the fight for freedom in his country.\nEverybody knows that the presidential elections in Belarus in March were neither free nor fair and that the European Union was not able to send its observers, their access to the count", "Strategy for the third meeting of the Parties to the Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the oral question by Mr Ouzk\u00fd, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, to the Commission: Commission's strategy for the third meeting of the Parties to the Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (B6-0157/2008).\nI would ask all of you present here whether there is any sense in having this debate. I think that without the rapporteur present we cannot continue the debate, so I am asking you to give me permission to close the debate today. Are there any objections?\nMarios Matsakis\nMr President, I just want some clarification. Do we have a reason why these people are not here, why the rapporteur is not here? Do you have an excuse or some information?\nPresident\nThe reason is that they are not here with us, and this is the only reason I can recognise. We have no idea; we have no secret agents.\nEija-Riitta Korhola\n(FI) Mr President, we all know that Mr Wojciechowski, as Chairman of the Committee, is only the formal author of the question. I myself have been rapporteur for the Aarhus Convention for many years. I have come here from a fantastic asparagus reception specifically to speak on this subject, and I would like to have my say.\n(The President cut off the speaker)\nPresident\nWith respect for your fantastic asparagus reception, without the author of the question we cannot proceed. I do not know what secret relations you have with the author of the question, but unfortunately we cannot continue. I am very sorry, Madam Commissioner.\nIn\u00e9s Ayala Sender\n(ES) Mr President, I fail to see which Rule of Procedure prevents us from discussing the issue. The Commissioner is here, and she certainly deserves our respect. I think that all the Members prese", "6. Succession and wills (vote) \n- before the vote on Amendment 3:\nMaria Berger\n(DE) Mr President, I move that our Amendment 3 be amended so that, in the English text, the word 'testator' is replaced in its two occurrences by the word 'deceased', and the period for which a normal residence may be maintained is reduced from three to two years.\n(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)\n- before the vote on Amendment 1:\nMaria Berger\n(DE) Mr President, although this amendment was intended to delete a number of words from our rapporteur's original text, its effect was to delete a few too many of them, so the words 'with binding effect' should stand and not be deleted.\n(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)\n", "Welcome\nPresident\nI am pleased to welcome another delegation that is in the official gallery.

I should also like to thank the other rapporteurs, who have done, and continue to do, a marvellous job, as well as all those who assist them.\nOn behalf of President Barroso's Commission, I should like to say that we acknowledge the political purpose and goodwill shown by Parliament with regard to a fundamental issue, as defined in the various reports and proposals from the Commission aimed at constructing an effective and credible supervisory architecture.\nThis is a fundamental issue because it determines the success or otherwise of a number of other decisions relating to transparency, supervisio", "Informal summit in Lahti and EU-Russia relations following the murder of journalist Anna Politkovskaya (debate) \nPresident\nWe shall proceed to the next item on the agenda. This is the Council and Commission statements on the Preparation for the Informal Meeting of Heads of State or Government in Lahti and also, in accordance with the House's decision, relations between the European Union and Russia following the murder of Anna Politkovskaya.\nPaula Lehtom\u00e4ki\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I wish to thank you sincerely for the opportunity to come here and discuss the informal summit of the Heads of State or Government in Lahti, to be held on 20 October.\nWe decided to hold the Lahti Summit because we want to give the Heads of State or Government of the Member States of the Union the opportunity for an open and informal debate on two themes which are important for the Union's future and for economic success: innovation and external energy relations.\nWe need a firm, consistent policy on building a favourable environment for innovation and on energy issues. In this way we will be able to improve conditions for economic growth and employment in the Union. If the Union does something tangible to promote welfare and prosperity, we can also expect the Union to become more acceptable in the eyes of the people. A consistent common policy on energy will at the same time strengthen the Union's credibility as an international player.\nTo guide the discussions at the Summit of the Heads of State or Government, two communications are being drafted by the Commission. One is on external energy relations, and the other is on innovation policy. The communications are to be released tomorrow, 12 October. They are not meant to be approved at the meeting, but they indicate those questions which we want to address at Lahti.\nBefore the unofficial Summit at Lahti, an Informal Tripartite Social Summit will also be held on the Friday morning.

I am thinking of the passing of the Law on Foundations and, even more recently, the first modification of Article 301 which must lead to further reforms that are necessary to guarantee full freedom of expression. However, it is also clear that Turkey presents a mixed picture and that much more needs to be done, not just to comply with the agreements with Europe, but also to fulfil promises to its own people.\nThis report is balanced. I hope that some hobbyhorses that are being ridden will not get anywhere, because then the report will remain balanced. I have mentioned all the problems in the report and there are three important messages.\nFirstly, we are concerned about the implications of the AK Party case before the court. We expect the Constitutional Court to respect the principles of the rule of law, European standards and the Venice Commission guidelines on the prohibition of political parties. We welcome the fact that in 2007 democracy triumphed over attempts by the army to disrupt the political process. However, we are also concerned that there are still forces at work that are trying to destabilise the country. Clearly modernisation of the country and reforms are now needed. Prime Minister Erdo\u011fan has promised that 2008 will be the year of reforms and we shall be pleased to hold him to that. The government now has to use the substantial parliamentary majority to set about reforms with determination; reforms that are vital if Turkey is to be turned into a modern and prosperous democracy based on a secular state and a pluralistic society and reform that is first and foremost in the best interests of the Turkish people themselves.\nA third", "EU strategy towards Belarus (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report of the Council and the Commission on the strategy of the European Union towards Belarus.\nAlexandr Vondra\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, the situation in Belarus and what we should do and how we can help will, I think, without doubt be at the centre of the Council's attention during the Czech presidency.\nLet me start here on a positive note. We have noted with satisfaction the steps taken by Belarus in the past few weeks, including the registration of the 'For Freedom' movement, the printing and distribution of independent newspapers like Narodnaya Volya or Nasha Niva, the round table on the regulation of internet with the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media and the announcement of the start of expert consultations with OSCE/ODIHR on improving electoral legislation.\nThese steps go towards fulfilling the criteria expressed by the EU as a condition for maintaining the suspension of the visa ban beyond the initial six-month period. The EU has stressed the importance of moving on these issues in its contact with the Belarus administration.\nAhead of the sanction review - where we have to take a decision by early April - we will continue to use all political contacts, including bilateral contacts, to encourage Belarus to move forward on the problematic points which were identified in the Council conclusions of 13 October with further substantial steps. As a further sign of encouragement, our presidency intends to hold another foreign minister troika with Belarus on the margin of the January General Affairs and External Relations Council.\nWe will also continue to monitor the general situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the country, with a special emphasis on the regulatory environment of NGOs and the media. We are also closely discussing and exchanging views and information with the various opposition representatives and other persons in Belarus, people ", "Air pollution: ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Framework for Community Action in the field of Marine Environmental Policy (Marine Strategy Framework Directive) [09388/2/2007 - C6-0261/2007 - (Rapporteur: Marie-No\u00eblle Lienemann).\nHolger Krahmer\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the compromise on the Air Quality Directive is primarily the result of successful team work. I wish to emphasise this at the outset. My thanks especially to all my fellow Members who have taken an active part in defining the text of this Directive, particularly to the rapporteurs, Mrs Weisgerber of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and Mrs Corbey of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, as well as Mrs Hassi of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. I should also like to thank the Commission for its valuable assistance and the Portuguese Council Presidency, which has made a vital contribution to this good result as an open and constructive negotiating partner.\nThe compromise puts the EU's future air quality policy on a sound footing. The new Directive maintains the balance between ambitious targets and limits and the necessary flexibility for implementation in the Member States. In addition, the focus is directed more towards exposure and increased awareness of the need for measures at the sources of pollution.\nLet me first outline the key elements of the compromise. There has been decisive progress, which is the intention with the amendment of air quality legislation, in the regulation of the finest PM2.5 particulates. In the opinion of all the experts, the finest particulates originating exclusively from human sources pose the", "Interim Trade Agreement with Turkmenistan - Interim Agreement with Turkmenistan (debate) \nPresident\n- The next item is the joint debate on:\nthe oral question to the Council by Jan Marinus Wiersma, Erika Mann, Daniel Caspary, Robert Sturdy, Cristiana Muscardini and Eugenijus Maldeikis, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, on the Interim Trade Agreement between the EU and Turkmenistan - B6-0019/2009);\nthe oral question to the Commission by Jan Marinus Wiersma, Erika Mann, Daniel Caspary, Robert Sturdy, Cristiana Muscardini and Eugenijus Maldeikis, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, on the Interim Trade Agreement between the EU and Turkmenistan - B6-0020/2009); and\nthe report by Mr Caspary, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the proposal for a Council and Commission decision on the conclusion of the Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Community and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and Turkmenistan, of the other part (05144/1999 - C5-0338/1999 -.\nJan Marinus Wiersma\nauthor. - (NL) Mr President, it is good that we are today debating the European Parliament's position on the Interim Trade Agreement with Turkmenistan, something that this Parliament and the European Union have long kept on the back burner. The Council and the Commission are looking for progress on this issue and they want the European Parliament to give its blessing or a positive verdict on the advent of this interim agreement, as that could help improve relations with Turkmenistan.\nThis has been on the back burner for a long while, and there is a reason for that. Parliament has hitherto been very hesitant to vote on ", "3. Sri Lanka\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Sri Lanka.\nGeoffrey Van Orden\nauthor. - Mr President, the people of Sri Lanka - Sinhalese and particularly the Tamils - have suffered enormously over these past 30 years from a ruthless terrorist campaign conducted by the LTTE. Now that the LTTE have been defeated in the field, the Government and people of Sri Lanka need our sympathetic understanding and, above all, our assistance as they try to set their country once more on the path of recovery and prosperity and prevent any resurgence of terrorism.\nThere are those, including LTTE apologists, who want to deliver a further blow to the Sri Lankan people by undermining the GSP+ preferential trade arrangements with the EU. I hope the Commission understands that it is trade, not aid, that offers the best route to economic recovery. For its part, the Sri Lankan authorities need to address the concerns expressed by friends in the international community so there is no excuse for GSP+ status to be compromised.\nThe immediate priority, of course, is to resettle those thousands of Tamil civilians caught up in the conflict and now being held in poor conditions in camps. Their processing needs to take place with all urgency, and the international community should be invited to help.\nProinsias De Rossa\nauthor. - Mr President, I support this resolution even though I think it is not critical enough of the Sri Lankan Government. Earlier this year, we witnessed the appalling military assault on the area held by the Tamil Tigers, without any regard for the lives or well-being of citizens who, in my view, are used as pawns by all sides, resulting in 90 000 dead. The world stood horrified and helpless, yet still today, there are more than a quarter of a million Sri Lankan citizens who are interned without adequate medical facilities, without clean water, sanitation or living space.\nToday's resolution is a relatively mild call on the Sri Lankan authori", "European Council meeting (8-9 March 2007) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is a report by the European Council and a statement by the Commission (European Council meeting, 8-9 March 2007).\nFrank-Walter Steinmeier\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following our debate on the Berlin Declaration, I should like to inform the House of the results of the Spring Summit. I shall do so gladly, and may I say at once - although it has just been remarked that we are too ready to sing our own praises - that, from the point of view of the Presidency - from my point of view - this was indeed a successful Council meeting. It provided answers in fields in which citizens - rightly, in my opinion - expect determined action at European level; it showed that, in defiance of all prophecies of doom, the EU is capable of action even following enlargement, and that the Member States - with the support and encouragement of the Commission and Parliament - are in a position to resolve their differences and set ambitious common targets - even if, of course, the individual decisions may not always be easy.\nThe Summit also showed that the Union is prepared to take up the pressing tasks of the future, and it gave us momentum and the courage to believe we can succeed also in reviving the flagging process of EU reform and renewal in the coming months.\nThis is the message conveyed by our latest Summit, which also produced the specific internal results I am just about to discuss, and we want to continue to send out this signal in two weeks' time - as we have just been discussing - at the celebrations in Berlin and throughout Europe for the 50th anniversary of the Union. This is the impetus we wish to take with us into the second half of our Presidency.\nAs you know, the Spring Summit focused on energy and climate policy. Both issues are rightly very high on the list of concerns of the European people.

In my opinion, we cannot discriminate against individual policy areas. Please be so good as to find out why this is happening.\n\nPresident\nThank you, Mr Stockmann. We will look into that for you.\n\nPlooij-van Gorsel\nMr President, I should like to raise a point which I have already raised at previous Strasbourg sittings. On 7 April, I tabled a written question to the President of Parliament, in other words to the Chair, concerning the supply of furniture for the bars and restaurants of the Leopold building. I tabled this question on 7 April. That is nearly six months ago, Mr President, and I have still not received an answer. The question has been put to you, and and I wonder why I have not received an answer. I would repeat that I have raised this on several previous occasions.\n\nPresident\nThank you, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel. We are preparing the reply and I hope you will receive it very shortly. But I will do my best to ensure that the presidency sends it to you as soon as possible.\n(The Minutes were approved)\n\n5th framework programme\nPresident\nThe next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0324/98), on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the common position adopted by the Council (C4-0419/98-97/0309(SYN)) with a view to adopting a Council Decision concerning the rules for the participation of undertakings, research centres and universities and for the dissemination of research results for the implementation of the Fifth Framework Programme of the European Community (1998-2000) (Rapporteur: Mr Marset Campos).\n\nMarset Campos\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this second reading I would like to thank th", "Measuring devices containing mercury (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the report by Mrs Sornosa Mart\u00ednez, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 76/769/EEC relating to restrictions on the marketing of certain measuring devices containing mercury - C6-0064/2006 -.\nG\u00fcnter Verheugen\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Sornosa Mart\u00ednez, for her work on this proposal for what is a very important directive, forming part of the Community action to deal with mercury, the Community strategy on which was debated in this House only recently.\nThis has to do with our common desire to prevent more mercury finding its way into the environment, and, in order that we may have no misconceptions about this, what we are talking about here is not just any old poison, but a particularly dangerous one, for mercury and its compounds are highly toxic to human health and the environment. The object of the directive we are debating today is to prevent new measuring devices containing mercury getting into circulation, and, if we were to succeed in that, we would prevent 30 tonnes of mercury - which adds up to a very considerable health hazard - getting into the environment.\nThe proposed directive will prohibit outright the placing on the market of clinical thermometers containing mercury, the reason being that alternatives to them have been available for some time. It will also prevent the sale to the general public of all other measuring instruments containing mercury. These proposals were put together on the basis of a risk assessment and an extensive impact assessment devised for the mercury strategy, followed by consultations with the industry and with other interested parties.\nThe proposed directive will not only ensure the protection of human health and of the environment, bu", "Order of business\nPresident\nThe final draft agenda, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at a meeting on Thursday, 5 May 2011, pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed. The following amendments have been proposed:\n[Wednesday]:\nThere is an amendment which will shortly be presented by Mr Speroni. Regarding the debate on foreign, security and defence policy, the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group has requested that the statement on the situation in Syria and Camp Ashraf by the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission should include the Coptic Christian community in Egypt. This is an amendment for Wednesday, for the morning session at 09:00 when Mrs Ashton will be present. Mr Speroni will now present the amendment. Thank you.\nFrancesco Enrico Speroni\nMr President, we did not want to fundamentally change - or rather propose to fundamentally change - the order of business by adding or replacing an item; we are simply asking to expand the topic on which the Vice-President will be reporting.\nWe are simply asking that Syria, Camp Ashraf and the matter of the Christian minority, and, above all, the Coptic minority, in Egypt, be added to the topic under discussion. We are talking about a sensitive area and a topic that concerns the protection of minorities, which is why I ask my fellow Members to approve this proposal.\nBruno Gollnisch\n(FR) Mr President, I fully support that request but I asked you for the floor in order to speak about Tuesday's order of business. I do not know whether you can give me the floor now or whether you wish to give it to me after the decision on Mr Speroni's proposal.\nPresident\nWe must now close our initial discussion on the point regarding Wednesday.\nMario Mauro\n(IT) Mr President, I am taking the floor in order to support Mr Speroni's request, precisely because the situation dominated by clashes involving the Coptic community is an illustration of the risks associated with what is happening in Eg", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 4 May 2000.\n\nPresident\n- Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, on Saturday, a horrific accident struck the people of Enschede, in the Netherlands. There was an explosion in a fireworks warehouse which has already caused at least sixteen deaths and has injured over six hundred people, six of whom are in a critical condition, with many more people reported missing. Around four hundred homes have been destroyed by the explosion, and more than a thousand have suffered damage. This is one of the most terrible disasters in the Netherlands since the second world war.\nI have contacted the Dutch authorities to express our deepest sympathy, both in a personal capacity and on behalf of the European Parliament. At this sad time, our thoughts go out to the victims, to their families, and also to the emergency rescue teams who are working tirelessly. Ladies and gentlemen, I invite you to observe a minute' s silence.\n(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)\n\nOostlander\nMadam President, on behalf of the 31 Dutch delegates of this European Parliament, I would like to convey to you my heartfelt thanks for the words you spoke a moment ago and for the respect this Parliament has shown for the victims of this terrible disaster in Enschede and for their relatives.\nMadam President, on behalf of the 31 delegates, there is actually little I could add to your words. I would, however, like to underline how we have been moved not only by what you said a moment ago and the silence that was observed, but also by the prompt assistance across the borders to relieve the distress following this disaster. At a moment' s notice, German colleagues joined forces with their Dutch friends to carry out the frequently dangerous activities which were necessary to control the disaster. German hospitals too have been involved in the care of the wounded, dozens of whom are still in hospital.", "Dangerous toys manufactured in China (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on dangerous toys manufactured in China.\nTwo Commissioners will speak.\nG\u00fcnter Verheugen\nVice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen. Toys are not like any other product. They are designed for the most vulnerable consumer group of all and it is therefore perfectly clear that we must have the highest standards for toys where children's safety is concerned. A whole range of very grave issues have rightly been raised here in connection with the latest recall campaigns of an American manufacturer, which has recalled faulty products from the market at its own initiative.\nFirst of all I would like to say that both cases concerned here involve products not licensed under European law for the European market. Toys with lead paint have, of course, been banned in Europe for a long time, unlike in the United States of America. Toys with magnetic parts or other dangerous parts which could become loose have also been banned, of course, for a long time in Europe. What we have here, therefore, is not a problem of applicable law (although I will be coming to applicable law, an area in which something has to be changed, later), but it is a problem of the implementation and observance of the applicable law.\nProducts we deal with every day cannot be one hundred per cent safe. The best legislator in the world cannot guarantee that no defects will occur in production. The best legislator in the world cannot guarantee that supply chains now organised on a global basis will not encounter a problem at any point. Nor can the best legislator in the world prevent trade with criminal or fraudulent intent.\nI would remind you of the case in which three people died in Greece after using a faulty steam iron. This iron not only had the European CE marking, but also a specific German safety symbol. Nevertheless the appliance was not safe, probably because it was counte", "Cross-border payments in the Community - The business of electronic money institutions (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on:\nthe report by Mrs Starkevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on cross-border payments in the Community - C6-0352/2008 -, and\n- the report by Mr Purvis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the taking up, pursuit and prudential supervision of the business of electronic money institutions, amending Directives 2005/60/EC and 2006/48/EC and repealing Directive 2000/46/EC - C6-0350/2008 -.\nMargarita Starkevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117\nrapporteur. - (LT) Today, as the European Union's economy experiences a period of recession, it is very important to stimulate economic growth. One of the sources of the European Union's economic growth is the expansion of the common market, which is still very fragmented, especially in the area of financial services. The proposal before us should help solve this problem and establish a common European payment area. In English this is called the Single Euro Payments Area.\nThis document already has some history. As soon as the euro was introduced and the currency exchange rates were abolished in euro zone countries, it became clear that prices for cross-border payments still differed from prices for local payments. For this reason Regulation (EC) No 2560 of the European Parliament and of the Council on cross-border payments in euro was adopted and entered into force at the end of 2001. It set equal charges for corresponding local, national payments and cross-border payments and strengthened this principle. The aim of this was to reduce prices for consumers and ensure greater competition in the payment services market.\nImplementing this regulation reduced payment fees; for example, a cross-border transfer of ", "Voting time\nPresident\nWe shall now proceed to the vote.\n(For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)\nToday we are facing an unusually important, but also symbolic vote. Once every five years, the European Parliament decides who will head another EU institution.\n", "Eurozone (2007) - European Central Bank (2006) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on\nthe report by Dariusz Rosati on behalf of the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs on the Eurozone annual report 2007 (2007/2143()INI) and\nthe report by Gay Mitchell on behalf of the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs on the European Central Bank's annual report for 2006.\nI am very pleased to welcome the President of the Euro Group, the Luxembourg Prime Minister and Finance Minister Jean-Claude Juncker. I am also delighted to welcome the President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet to the European Parliament. Let me also extend a warm welcome to Commissioner Joaqu\u00edn Almunia.\nDariusz Rosati\nrapporteur. - Mr President, I am pleased to present the second ever report of the European Parliament in response to the Annual Report of the European Commission on the Eurozone. The Commission's report presents the economic situation in the Eurozone in 2007.\nThe results of the report are cause for satisfaction. The economic growth rate in the Eurozone rose to 2.7%, which is the best result since 2000, whilst unemployment fell to 7.6%, the lowest in 15 years. At the same time the Eurozone has become an increasing factor in stabilising the world economy.\nThis generally optimistic picture, however, should not conceal some negatives, and these are what we focus on in our report. Firstly, the rate of fiscal adaptation, particularly in countries with large budget deficits, is too slow, bearing in mind that the stability and growth pact obliges Member States to maintain as balanced a budget as possible in the medium term. That involves building up a budget surplus in good times to have a financial reserve for times of recession. In this context we are critical of the behaviour of some Member States who are not making use of the current period of growth to implement the necessary cuts in public spending.\nSecondly, Parliament points out that the good avera", "Selection process of a new Managing Director for the IMF and external representation of the euro (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the selection process of a new Managing Director for the IMF and external representation of the euro.\nOlli Rehn\nMember of the Commission. - Madam President, honourable Members, many thanks for your very pertinent questions. The Commission welcomes the decision of the Executive Board of the IMF on 20 May this year, which clarifies the selection process for the next Managing Director of the IMF.\nThe Commission agrees that the selection process has to be open, transparent and merit-based. This will enable candidates from all IMF member countries to compete on the basis of their merits, taking into account all relevant aspects.\nThe EU Member States have agreed that they will back the best qualified candidate who is able to meet the high standards required to fulfil the responsibilities attached to this very important position. Such a candidate will, in particular, need to have demonstrated strong capabilities, a commitment to multilateral coordination, and a great knowledge of international economic, financial and monetary affairs. The Commission supports this agreement.\nThe Commission fully supports the candidacy of Minister Christine Lagarde. She is a competent and experienced candidate, who has gained the respect of our partners in the international community. She not only has a very good knowledge of the European economy and EU decision making, which is a merit in these times, but also very strong experience in global economic governance - through her successful management of the G20 Presidency, for instance.\nLet me also add that last year, an agreement was reached at the G20 summit in Seoul in Korea to reduce European representation in relative terms on the IMF Board by two seats, so as to increase the voice and representation of emerging market economies.\nThe issue of the external representation of the eu", "11. Food information to consumers (\nRenate Sommer\nMr President, this is simply about clarifying the language used in the German version. No changes are needed in the other language versions. This is only necessary for reasons of legal certainty and concerns 'nicht vorverpackte Lebensmittel' (non-prepacked food) instead of 'nicht fertig abgepackte Lebensmittel' (non-packaged food). This is a linguistic change in the German version.\nRenate Sommer\nMr President, this amendment concerns labelling products that contain nanomaterials. I am fundamentally in favour of the amendment. I would just like to clarify that these must be stable nanomaterials. There are also unstable nanomaterials, such as sugar, which can be ground to such a fine powder that the particles are nano-sized. All the indications are that unstable nanomaterials do not harm living organisms. Therefore, I would like to see the following addition to the oral amendment: 'For products containing stable nanomaterials'.\nGlenis Willmott\nMr President, I just want to move the words 'of origin' in this paragraph, so it reads: 'the country or place of provenance'. That is much more transparent for consumers.\nRenate Sommer\nMr President, the first part of Amendment 101 has been accepted and the second part rejected. According to my understanding of Amendment 328, we therefore still need to vote on it. This also concerns the technical adaptation which forms part of the changes that we have to make following the Treaty of Lisbon. The term 'comitology system' must be replaced by the term 'delegated act'. For this reason, I believe that we still have to vote on this.\nCarl Schlyter\nMr President, actually, the EPP amendment and original texts change some things, but neither the EPP amendment nor the original text touch upon the issue of trans fats. Therefore, that corresponding part of 144 should still be voted, even if 295 is adopted, because trans fats are an important issue for many people here.\nRenate Sommer\nMr President", "EU protein deficit (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr H\u00e4usling, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the EU protein deficit: what solution for a long-standing problem?.\nMartin H\u00e4usling\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressing my deep gratitude to the shadow rapporteurs for their kind cooperation on this report. It has become a very ambitious report. I would like to touch on a few of the important points, but I will not shrink from mentioning the controversial aspects either.\nWe have a huge protein deficit in the European Union. Eighty percent of our protein crop requirement is imported, and I regret to say that this tendency is increasing. That means that we are using around 20 million hectares of arable land in other countries or, to put it another way, outsourcing 10% of our arable land to other countries for the cultivation of protein crops. One reason for this is the Blair House Agreement that was concluded in the early 1990s, which had a huge adverse effect on the competitiveness of European protein crops. That is the reason why our market has been flooded with cheap soya. There has been a 30% decline in protein crop cultivation in the European Union in the case of leguminous plants, and now only 3% of European arable land is used for growing protein crops. In Germany, the figure is just 1%.\nProduction in Europe has reached a critical point that puts research and development of European protein crops at risk. Political measures are required to promote a return to the growing of protein crops in Europe; otherwise, we will fall below a threshold that endangers the very survival of protein crop cultivation in Europe. In so doing, we would also lose the positive effects of protein crops, particularly the sensible organisation of crop rotation in agriculture.\nEuropean protein crop cultivation has huge potential. One point we have stated is that fair competition must be rest", "European strategy for the economic and social development of mountain regions, islands and sparsely populated areas (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the European strategy for the economic and social development of mountain regions, islands and sparsely populated areas.\nJohannes Hahn\nMr President, one might almost think that Europe was an alpine island. However, I am pleased that the European Parliament has an ongoing concern for the economic and social development of regions with special needs; special areas such as mountain regions, islands and sparsely populated areas.\nThe Treaty of Lisbon reinforces the importance of territorial cohesion. It is set out as one of the objectives of the Union in Article 174. For this reason, the Commission presented the Green Paper on territorial cohesion in order to initiate a comprehensive process of debate. One of the main results of this consultation was that it is not necessarily new and additional financial resources that are required, but rather we should emphasise the importance of integrated territorial development concepts and give greater consideration to the strengths of the various regions.\nAs far as I am concerned, the particular characteristics of a region can fundamentally be a strength. Such regional peculiarities - whether it is its status as an island, the fact that it is a mountain region or that it is a sparsely populated area - therefore do not automatically create problems or require greater assistance, especially since these areas are in no way uniform. There can therefore be no 'one size fits all' solution for these regions that might seem to belong together.\nThe Commission considers it of the utmost importance to ensure the harmonious common growth of the regions. I am therefore concerned that we implement our joint Europe 2020 strategy in all regions, rather than applying different strategies to differently structured regions - which might jeopardise our joint efforts rather", "1. Iraq - in particular, the death penalty (including the case of Tariq Aziz) and attacks against Christian communities\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Iraq - in particular, the death penalty (including the case of Tariq Aziz) and attacks against Christian communities.\nBastiaan Belder\nMadam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 12 November, a German newspaper ran the headline 'Iraqi Christians hunted to death'. The picture accompanying the article showed a Christian family sheltering in a church in the capital Baghdad. The family had taken refuge in this house of worship after Islamic terrorists had begun a determined attack on the homes of Christians. The revolting bloodbath of 31 October during a service in the Syriac Catholic cathedral was certainly, therefore, no isolated incident. The Christian minority in Mesopotamia has been exposed to outright religious persecution for years. That is the sad reality in Iraq. Witness the massive exodus of Iraqi Christians. Since 2003, their numbers in Iraq have dropped from 850 000 to 350 000, 115 000 of whom have been internally displaced. What can these courageous 'hangers-on' - in quotation marks, because Iraq is where they belong - expect from Europe? After all, this is a Christian minority whose historical roots in Iraq can be traced back to the 1st century AD and include the world's oldest churches and monasteries. I would plead for three concrete European relief efforts for Iraqi Christians. First of all, support Iraqi Christians who have fled to the Kurdish region to build a new life. Give them a future within their own country. The same is true for the Christian minority in the plain of Nineveh. European aid for vocational training, jobs for young people and loans for new businesses. Secondly, the European institutions should urge the Iraqi Government - and this is a matter of extreme urgency - to drop the statement of the holder's religion from identity cards, beca", "Aviation security charges (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Leichtfried, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on aviation security charges - C7-0038/2009 -.\nJ\u00f6rg Leichtfried\nMadam President, at the moment, in the area of European aviation security and aviation security charges, we have a situation in which everyone does what they want. No one really does it properly. However, we will have to pay for this. This is something that we really should not take lying down, and this report aims to change things. What specifically will it change, and what does it aim to change?\nI would just like to say in advance that on almost all points - and I would like to thank my fellow Member - there is a unanimous perception that the report could bring more transparency. Transparency means that on the one hand, airlines will, in future, be able to obtain information allowing them to understand what security charges will be applied to them by airports, what they are for, whether they are too much - which still sometimes happens at the moment - and, as the next step, that passengers too, of course, will be able to understand what airlines require from them. Here too, I have the suspicion that the transparency of the airlines is sometimes intentionally restricted, even when, as they say, they make a great effort to be transparent.\nOne point which is very important in this regard is the fact that, across Europe, there are various different systems for financing security facilities. There are states which have financed them purely through taxation. There are states in which only the end-user pays, and there are others which have a mixed system.\nOur intention was to ensure that these systems could be retained. We do not want to prescribe to any Member State how security charges should be financed; we only want to ensure that whoever pays ultimately knows what he has paid.\nThere ", "Immigration, the role of Frontex and cooperation among Member States (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on immigration, the role of Frontex, and cooperation among Member States.\nTobias Billstr\u00f6m\nMr President, issues concerning migration are always topical in the EU's work. An important element in dealing with migratory flows is border control. Free movement for people within the EU and the absence of controls at internal borders bring a shared responsibility and an increased requirement for proper and effective management of our external borders.\nThe European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex) is responsible for coordinating and supporting Member States' efforts to monitor and control the EU's external borders. Frontex is an important element in the EU's integrated border management strategy. Since its launch in 2005, Frontex's capacity has been progressively expanded. In line with an increased budget, Frontex now plays an even greater role in managing the operational cooperation between Member States in connection with the control of the EU's external borders.\nThe Agency is currently coordinating a number of joint operations and pilot projects at maritime, land and air borders with a view to combating illegal immigration, with a particular emphasis on certain high-risk areas such as the southern maritime borders of the EU, although the northern and eastern borders are also covered. In the Council, we have, on several occasions, emphasised the need to develop and strengthen Frontex. The Council's conclusions from 2008 give the political priorities for the continued development of the Agency. In the short term, it was stressed that Frontex must be allocated the necessary resources and that maximum use must be made of the equipment provided by the Member States within the framework of the Centralised Record of Available Technical Equip", "Regional policy (islands and natural and economic constraints) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Musotto, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the islands and natural and economic constraints in the context of the regional policy.\nFrancesco Musotto \nrapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my sincere thanks to all my fellow Members who have contributed to the drafting of this report. We believe that this is the first time that a complete study has been dedicated to the islands, taking account of their specific characteristics with regard to all areas of Community competence: although the 2007-2013 cohesion policy pays particular attention to structurally disadvantaged regions, no specific measures are provided for island regions.\nParliament has highlighted this gap several times and, although the situation in European islands is varied - there are 121 islands in all, with a population of roughly 15 million inhabitants - they share a series of difficulties that constitute a competitive disadvantage: higher prices due to additional transport costs and little competition; difficulty in accessing the single market, the need to import raw materials, higher energy costs, lack of infrastructure, immigration, limited diversification of economic activities and vulnerability to environmental risks. It is no accident that the average per capita GDP on the islands is 72% of the European Union average. It is therefore necessary to recognise their specific island characteristics when implementing Community policy, beginning with State aids. We believe that greater flexibility is needed in order to offset the additional costs and, as regards energy, to compensate for fluctuations in the cost of fuel.\nIn the context of the Structural Funds operating programmes, particular emphasis must be given to carrying out infrastructure projects, especially within the framework of European maritime policy", "Order of business\nPresident\nThe final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 18 November 2010 pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed. The following amendments have been proposed:\nMonday:\nThe political groups are proposing to remove the debate on Mr Berlinguer's report on civil, commercial, family and private international law aspects of the action plan implementing the Stockholm Programme from the agenda. As a result, the report would be subject to a direct vote tomorrow, on Tuesday. The report will stay. There will be a vote, but no debate. I repeat: all the political groups have agreed to this solution and this solution has thus been accepted.\n(Parliament agreed to the request)\nTuesday:\nNo amendments have been proposed.\nMartin Schulz\n(DE) Mr President, on the agenda for Tuesday, there are six reports by Mrs Matera concerning mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in the Netherlands. I am taking the floor on this because I think that the way Mr Daul has been attacked on this matter in the Dutch press is not right. At the Conference of Presidents, Mr Daul raised the question that had been discussed by the heads of the various groups concerning whether these reports should not be dropped in the light of the budget debate. I would like to make two comments on this.\nFirstly, we should leave these reports on the agenda. We should also vote them through and transfer this money from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to the Netherlands.\nSecondly, however, Mr Daul suggested it in a comment made at the Conference of Presidents. If it is then taken from the Conference of Presidents into the public domain without him even being given an opportunity to answer questions and explain it himself, then, as the chair of a group, one has to consider very carefully what in fact one can say at the Conference of Presidents. That is the first point.\nMy other point is that", "Consumer Policy Strategy 2002-2006\nPresident.\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following reports:\n(A5-0023/2003) by Mr Whitehead, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Commission Communication to the European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the \"Consumer Policy Strategy 2002-2006\" (COM(2002) 208 - C5-0329/2002 - 2002/2173(COS))\n(A5-0423/2002) by Mrs Patrie, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the implications of the Commission Green Paper on European Union Consumer Protection for the future of EU consumer policy (COM(2001) 531 - C5-0295/2002 - 2002/2151(COS))\n(A5-0054/2003) by Mrs Thyssen, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the prospects for legal protection of the consumer in the light of the Commission Green Paper on European Union Consumer Protection (COM(2001) 531 - C5-0294/2002 - 2002/2150(COS))\n\nWhitehead (PSE)\nMr President, it is a pleasure that this morning this House can have a diversion from the distant drumbeats of war to the needs of the citizen as consumer. Those needs are addressed in the consumer action plan 2002-2006 and in the Green Paper and its follow-up on consumer protection. I shall be introducing my own report and that of our distinguished colleague Mrs Patrie, who is unable to attend today.\nA major debate is now under way about consumer policy. It is being aired at the Convention with doubts, which I share, about the apparent demotion of consumer priorities by an amalgamated Council, which also has to cover social affairs, employment and health. It is present in the financial anxieties which beset the one area - food safety - which we had intended to be freestanding and no longer part of these general debates. I share the concerns expressed about the funding - for which this Parliament has part of the responsibility - for the ESFA, at lon", "3. Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (\n- Before the vote:\nSilvia-Adriana \u0162ic\u0103u\n(FR) Mr President, I would like to ask for a separate vote on Amendment 18 because it deals with the Agency's seat.

Five months previously, his chronic illness had forced him to resign as Prime Minister of Greece in the middle of his third term of office. For ten years he had set his seal on Greek policy as Prime Minister and during that time had established his country's place in the European Union.\nHe was not an easy partner to deal with - not even for his friends - but there again he was not the Prime Minister of an easy country either. The positions he adopted did not always meet with approval. That has to do with his country's difficult neighbours and with a history full of disruptions and antitheses. But as President of the European Council he was also able to achieve integration at crucial moments, thereby helping the Community to make vital progress: in 1988, when the Council adopted the financial package that was needed to achieve the aim of the Single European Act, and in 1994, when the last remaining institutional questions were resolved to pave the way for the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden to the European Union.\nAndreas Papandreou heightened our awareness of the significance of Greece and of the Mediterranean region, with its great strategic importance to Europe. Andreas Papandreou played a vital part in restoring freedom and democracy in Greece after the dark years of military rule. He was one of the fathers of democratic Greece, who led it into the community and solidarity of the European democracies and irreversibly embedded it there.\nAndreas Papandreou had a gift that few people possess, namely the ability to captivate others through his personality, his life and his work. For Greece and its people he was greater than the sum of his numerous public offices and political achievements. The overwhelming grief of the many thousands of people who paid their last respects to him on the day of his funeral reflected the esteem in which he was held. We sense the loss felt by his cou", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of Wednesday 13 May have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nThors\nMr President, please permit me, despite the fact that today is Thursday - a play on words which perhaps only Scandinavians will understand - to ask for a correction to the Minutes. The fact is, my name was missing yesterday, even though I was demonstrably present at the vote. I would therefore request a correction.\n(The Minutes were approved)\n\nKillilea\nMr President, I should like to raise with you and Parliament an observation I made on Tuesday's Minutes, concerning your decision to ask for the removal of the banners and the symbols that were in this House. I noted in the Minutes that you were not accorded what other Members were - applause and comment.\nI thought that the Minutes were quite unfair because I saw in you, when you were in the Chair, a very authoritative President. I think the Minutes should have recorded it accordingly.\n(Applause )\n\nPresident\nMr Killilea, your observation is of course a courtesy for which I must thank you, but I do not think the Minutes are the proper place to portray reactions to comments or the way in which the sittings are conducted or not conducted.\n\nImprovements in the functioning of the Institutions\nPresident\nThe next item is the report (A4-0117/98) by Mr Herman, on behalf of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, on improvements in the functioning of the Institutions without modification of the Treaties - making EU policies more open and democratic.\n\nHerman\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, experience has shown that, for the most part, institutional improvements yielded by successive amendments to the Treaties have not so much been the result of negotiations at the Intergovernmental Conference as the sanctioning of established practices, either by means of institutional agreements or following Court of Justice decisions - for example, in the isoglucose ruling - or by extensive use of existing procedures so a", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nJaros\u0142aw Kalinowski\n(PL) Mr President, alternative investment funds are of very great significance to the Union's economy. The managers of these funds have to keep to legislation and standards which enable the provision of services in the territory of Member States, and supervision of financial markets has to be accurate and effective. To this end, we must eliminate every lack of precision in the legal and administrative systems responsible for these funds. The proposals which have been submitted improve the transparency and efficiency of systems of supervision, and the greater effectiveness of legislation will bear fruit in an improvement in the stability and credibility of financial institutions, and, as a result, an improvement in the European economy.\nMario Pirillo\n(IT) Mr President, today's vote represents a significant step forward by the European Union in the regulation of alternative investment funds. Under the directive, fund managers must be registered and authorised and respect stringent codes of conduct within the European Union. This is, in fact, the first time that this sector has been regulated, and I believe that the paper we have voted on has paved the way to achieving - soon, I hope - a true single market in financial products.\nI should like to emphasise the important role of the European Parliament, which has insisted on strong rules for greater monitoring of the financial industry, which will therefore also become - I hope you do not mind my saying it - more ethical. The lessons of the recent past, of the financial crisis triggered by excessive speculation by investment funds, should lead us to welcome this directive, which offers greater guarantees of protection to the public.\nI voted in favour of the compromise that was achieved and, finally, I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Gauz\u00e8s, on his mammoth task.\nSyed Kamall\nMr President, when we looked at the initial", "Opening of annual session\nPresident\nI declare the 1998-1999 session of the European Parliament open.\n\nApproval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of Monday, 9 March 1998 have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nHabsburg-Lothringen\nMr President, I would like to refer to Item 2 of the Minutes of yesterday's sitting, and return to the subject of crime in Brussels. It states here that the President said this item should not actually have been in the Minutes, although it was certainly in the Minutes for the Friday of the last part-session. The President also mentioned that he would inform the two signatories of the request for a topical and urgent debate in writing. Could the Bureau please consider whether this could not be debated here in plenary? We know that over a third of Members have been victims of criminal acts in Brussels, so that this really affects everyone and not just one or two people in this House. I really think it is high time something was done about this in Parliament.\n\nPresident\nAs you know, this matter is not on the agenda. Moreover, I have nothing to add to what Mr Gil-Robles GilDelgado said yesterday. The Presidency is very concerned about the problem and has taken all the necessary steps with regard to the Belgian authorities. We will report any concrete news immediately.\nAre there any further comments?\n\nMcMahon\nMr President, my point concerns page 15 of the Minutes. There is a list there of the questions for Question Time to the Commission. My question, which is on structural funds and eligibility for structural funds, has been put down under 'Any Other Questions' , and yet earlier in the afternoon Mrs Wulf-Mathies, the Regional Affairs Commissioner, is answering questions. I would ask your services to look at that and see if this question about the structural funds could be transferred so that it gets an answer from the Commissioner concerned. Thank you.\n\nPresident\nMr McMahon, we will see if this correction can be made but, as you know,", "27. 2006 discharge: European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (\n- After the vote:\nJutta Haug\n(DE) Mr President, I would just like the honourable Members to know that we have now blocked and voted against the European Labelling Directive ten times - and we will do it ten more times.

Roadmap for the European Union's constitutional process (vote) \n- Report: Bar\u00f3n Crespo/Brok\n- Before the vote:\nJens-Peter Bonde\nMr President, I would like to make a point of order based on Rules 166 and 167 on the admissibility of part of a resolution. Parliament's Legal Service has said that we cannot use a non-ratified Treaty as a reference in our reports. This applies to the first indent of the Bar\u00f3n Crespo/Brok report.\n(Applause from the IND/DEM Group)\nI would like you to delete the reference, if the House should be so unwise as not to adopt our alternative resolution, which could solve the problem of inadmissibility much more easily.\nMay I also ask you to change all other reports referring to the proposed Constitution or the Charter of Fundamental Rights. According to Eurolex, 117 adopted legislative acts now include such references to the Charter. There are seven references to the Constitution. This information comes from Commission President Barroso, in an answer to a written question.\nMr President, I am sure that you and Mr P\u00f6ttering, in particular, as a skilled and very well educated lawyer, are the right people to establish law and order in our House. The Constitution has only been ratified by 16, not 18, of the 27 Member States, representing 37% of the citizens. This is still far from the unanimity required to make it a legal-base reference point. Your Legal Service is entirely right.\n(Applause from certain quarters)\nPresident\nMr Bonde, the interpretation of the Presidency, which, as you know, is responsible for interpreting the Rules of Procedure (with the greatest of respect for the Legal Service, of course, but it is not the Legal Service that interprets the Rules of Procedure, but rather the Presidency) ... As I was saying, the reference to a document that exists, regardless of whether or not it has been ratified by all of the Member States, and which has been signed by all of the Heads of State or Government, regardless of whether or not it has b", "Decision on urgent procedure\nPresident.\n I will give the floor straight away to Mrs Roure so that she can give us the opinion of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.\nRoure (PSE), rapporteur. (FR) Madam President, on 14 November in this very Chamber I tabled a report - which Parliament approved - on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on a French initiative with a view to adopting a Convention on improving mutual assistance in criminal matters.\nToday the Council is consulting us once again, this time on a new text of a draft protocol. Following the Extraordinary European Council meeting of 21 September, which was devoted to the fight against terrorism, we are called on to make a decision on this as a matter of urgency. Obviously I understand that current circumstances are impelling the European Union to strengthen cooperation as quickly as possible in the fight against terrorism.\nNevertheless, I should like to make a number of comments. I will start by expressing my regret that the Council did not accept the amendment which we proposed and which sought to extend the non-invocability of professional secrecy to commercial activities and the financial advice activities of lawyers and other members of regulated legal professions. I do actually still believe that this provision is essential to the effectiveness of judicial cooperation to combat money laundering. I also regret the fact that the Council did not reach an agreement on dual criminal liability.\nHaving said this, I see that the text of the protocol contains much more precise provisions on monitoring banking transactions. I also note with interest that in the future it will be Eurojust which will play a major role in ensuring that the mutual assistance system works smoothly.\nHaving made these comments, I can of course go along with the Commission and accept that the European Parliament should, in this exceptional case - without a ", "EC-Russia short-stay visa agreement - EC-Russia readmission agreement (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on:\nthe report by Mrs da Assun\u00e7\u00e3o Esteves, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the agreement between the European Community and the Russian Federation on the facilitation of issuance of short-stay visas - C6-0169/2006 -, and\nthe report by Mrs da Assun\u00e7\u00e3o Esteves, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the agreement between the European Community and the Russian Federation on readmission - C6-0168/2006 -.\nG\u00fcnter Gloser\nMr President, on this occasion, I am speaking on behalf of both the Commission and the Council, both of which are entirely supportive of your House's concerns as regards respect for human rights in the Russian Federation, and confirm that respect for human rights is fundamental to the implementation of the agreement between the European Community and the Russian Federation relating to visa facilitation and readmission.\nYou will be able carefully to monitor compliance with this aspect of the readmission agreement and of the agreement on visa facilitation through the joint committees set up pursuant to them, and, under the second of the two, you will also be keeping an eye on the principle of mutuality in the implementation of the agreement, on equal treatment in the registration of citizens of the European Union and of the Russian Federation and on the free movement of persons within the territory of the latter.\nRespect for human rights and basic freedoms is fundamental to relations between the European Union and Russia as a whole, which are underpinned by the partnership and cooperation agreements and by the timetables for the shared areas.\nThe European Union and the Russian Federation have also, in accordance with the timetable for the common", "Equal treatment between men and women engaged in a self-employed capacity - Pregnant workers (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on:\nthe report by Mrs Lulling, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity and repealing Directive 86/613/EEC - C6-0341/2008 -;\nthe report by Mrs Estrela, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 92/85/EEC on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding - C6-0340/2008 -.\nAstrid Lulling\nMr President, 22 years after the vote on a text that was already aimed at ensuring equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity, including their assisting spouses, the Commission has at last submitted a new proposal to replace the ineffective and toned-down 1986 text, but it has done so using a more solid legal basis.\nI should like first to mention a major improvement, namely that the establishment of a company between spouses or recognised life partners shall no longer be prohibited in any Member State. This is an effective way of improving the situation of assisting spouses, those millions of invisible workers employed in agriculture, craft occupations, commerce, SMEs and the liberal professions. Their fate has been a matter of concern for the European Parliament since the 1990s.\nUnfortunately, the Commission's proposal is still too weak on one essential point: the social security of assisting spouses and recognised life partners. Experience shows that, where assisting spouses have to take it upon themselves and apply to", "10.

So we are voting only on the second part.\n", "Report on the ECB annual report for 2007 (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Olle Schmidt on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the ECB annual report for 2007.\nOlle Schmidt\nrapporteur. - (SV) Mr President, Mr Trichet, Mr Juncker, all eyes are on the European Central Bank. The current uncertain economic situation and financial unrest are putting the ECB under great pressure. I am convinced that last week's interest rate rise was the right decision. Inflation is a scourge which redistributes assets unfairly. Europe's political leaders should be grateful that they have an independent central bank which is prepared to act in order to prevent Europe from lapsing into stagflation, low growth and rising inflation.\nTen years after its introduction, the euro is a world currency. The security and stability which it has brought to the euro zone and the Union as a whole, including my country, and even to the global economy are something no one could have dreamt of. Ireland's 'no' in the referendum was not a reaction to the strength of the euro. Asymmetric development of economies between the euro countries may constitute a risk, but it can be remedied by holding fast to the requirements of the stability pact for sound state finances and continued structural transformation in the Member States.\nAt the same time there is some point in reviewing, after 10 years, how the ECB operates; scrutiny, transparency, decision-making and the international role of the euro could be improved. The committee therefore proposes that the ECB should present a new proposal on how decision-making can be made transparent and more effective as the Eurogroup grows. The ECB should give an account of the discussion between Members of the Governing Council when decisions are taken on the interest base rate in order to increase transparency and enhance predictability. Its role as leader of the Eurogroup should be strengthened in order better to reflect the significanc", "Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting : see Minutes\n\nNigel Farage\nMadam President, concerning personal statements, in the debate we had this morning with Mr Sarkozy, I made a number of comments about the European Union's attitude towards democracy. In particular, I talked about the leader of the Socialist Group, Martin Schulz, having made some disparaging and derogatory comments in the debate in June of this year. He was allowed by the President, Mr P\u00f6ttering, to get up and to say that my comments had been untrue and that he had never in any way suggested that the 'no' side could be linked in the future with fascism. I would like, please, to set the record straight.\nOn 18 June, in this place, when talking about the 'no' vote in Ireland, this is exactly what Martin Schulz said. He said, 'The passion has migrated to the other side, the side which speaks ill of Europe, on the right wing of the political spectrum. It lies with those who speak ill of Europe, and who do so simply because they are afraid. In Europe, however, this mixture of social decline and fear has always opened the door to fascism.'\nMr Schulz may not like what I have to say. He may profoundly disagree with what I say. However, I would say to you, Mr Schulz, when I get up in this place, I always research very thoroughly what I say. I never stand up here and tell lies. What I said, I believed to be entirely true. I am not asking for an apology or anything of that kind. I do this to put the matter straight, and I regret that our President, Mr P\u00f6ttering, chose to use Rule 145 to allow Martin Schulz to take the floor this morning but not to allow me to take the floor this morning, which in fact was the very point of the speech I made this morning. It is not a level playing field in the European Union. It is as though you are the good guys if you are pro-Treaty and you are the bad guys if you are opposed to the Treaty. That, to me, is not very democratic.\nPresident\nMr Farage, your comments will be ", "Situation in Palestine (debate) \nPresident\nThe minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n(Parliament approved the minutes)\nThe next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Palestine.\nG\u00fcnter Gloser\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, recent days have seen a disturbing increase in violence in the Middle East, where conflict between Palestinian factions in the Gaza Strip has cost over 50 people their lives.\nIt is also from the Gaza Strip that over 150 Kassam missiles have been fired at Israeli towns over the past week, killing one Israeli woman yesterday evening. Israeli military action has already cost the lives of over 30 Palestinians, and the situation threatens to escalate still further. The cease fire in the Gaza Strip, agreed by the Palestinians and the Israelis in November is becoming visibly more fragile, and the inter-Palestinian reconciliation achieved in Mecca with Saudi help is at risk.\nThe Mecca agreement had its part to play in bringing rule by Hamas alone to an end. Since 18 March, Palestine has been ruled by a new government of national unity, enjoying the support and confidence of 83 out of 86 members of parliament - an overwhelming majority including all those belonging to Hamas and Fatah. There is still, however, broad consensus in the international community to the effect that the Palestinian Government has not yet quite passed its decisive test, in that it, too, does not completely meet the Quartet's three criteria.\nDespite this, the European Union has maintained its humanitarian aid for the Palestinians. I want to press home the point that the EUR 300 million given by the European Union amounts to more than that given in all previous years.\nThe Quartet's criteria do however, remain the basis on which a decision on any complete normalisation of our relations with the Palestinians will be taken: they require recognition ", "3. Syria: the case of Muhannad Al Hassani\nPresident\nI have received six motions for a resolution concerning Syria: the Muhannad Al Hassani case (Rule 122).\nFranziska Katharina Brantner\nauthor. - Mr President, I would like to present the case of Mr Muhannad Al Hassani. He has been imprisoned because he defends the human rights of his compatriots in Syria.\nHe played a very important role because he observed all trials before the Supreme State Security Court and made regular evaluations of detention conditions in Syria. He is now himself detained and imprisoned.\nWith regard to Syria, we ask that it fulfil its obligations and therefore comply with the international covenant on civil and political rights and with the UN Convention against torture, to which Syria is actually a party; that Syria reverse its policy of repression against human rights defenders and their families; and that it release the human rights defenders, prisoners of conscience and peace activists who are in prison.\nWe also have a request with regard to the EU. With respect to the signature of an association agreement we, the Greens and EFA, have proposed the adoption of a road map prior to the signature of the Association Agreement which would articulate our objectives in terms of improvements to be made in the human rights field.\nInternational law sets a series of obligations that states have to respect, and it is also our responsibility, and in particular of the entire EU, to ensure that respect thereof enters the association agreement as a way to enforce that further.\nWe will work in that direction. Thank you for your support for the resolution.\nV\u00e9ronique De Keyser\nMr President, I admit that I am both confused and also quite sad and disappointed.\nI am confused because, undoubtedly, in terms of international relations, Syria has made great progress over the past two years. It has joined the Union for the Mediterranean. It has, on various occasions, acted as a mediator in difficult international situ", "China's policy and its effects on Africa (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Ana Maria Gomes, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on China's policy and its effects on Africa.\nAna Maria Gomes\nrapporteur. - (PT) Mr President, China's unrestrained quest for oil, natural resources and new markets in Africa raises concerns about the impact of China's growing presence in that continent and the respective ramifications for European policies. Europe cannot start pointing the finger at China out of fear, nor can it afford to take part in an unprincipled competition avoiding methods and criteria that are in Beijing's own interest. Both Europe and China have an obligation to contribute to achieving the Millennium Development Goals: poverty reduction and conflict resolution in Africa. Both have to recognise that only through promoting sustainable development and good governance can their own interests and investments be sustainable and seen as legitimate in Africa.\nIn this report we have tried to analyse China's presence in Africa in an objective way, acknowledging both the positive and negative impacts. Based on various specific recommendations for action, there are two key political messages: firstly, the EU needs to give a coordinated response to the challenges raised by China's supposedly 'no strings' policy. This response cannot abandon European principles. The EU must stick to its development cooperation policy, especially as regards human rights conditionality. This is because there can be no good governance without respect for human rights and without good governance, and the rule of law it implies, there will be no sustainable development in Africa or any other part of the world. Secondly, Europe must involve China in discussions on their respective African policies, but such cooperation obviously cannot occur over the heads of the Africans. This trilateral involvement requires adequate support for the role to be played by the African institutions", "International Women's Day\nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by the President on International Women's Day.\nWomen's Day in Europe is, today, a different day from the one we remember, at least in Central and Eastern Europe. Nowadays, it is not only a matter of giving flowers to women we know. Today, Women's Day is also an opportunity for important debates on equality, support for mothers in families with many children and ending violence against women. The European Parliament is actively involved in these debates.\nThe Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality is an extremely important committee. In November 2009, we adopted a resolution on the elimination of violence against women in which we call on the European Commission and Member States to establish consistent programmes of action against this form of violence. It is our ambition that the European Union will be able to set an example to the whole world in this matter.\nWomen deserve more, today, because we do want, after all, to save Europe from demographic collapse, but this must not be done at the expense of women. Mothers of three or four children must have the possibility of employment and promotion on the same principles as men. Widely available nurseries and kindergartens, as well as jobs, are only one of the ways of achieving this objective. On the other hand, however, mothers who wish to remain at home with their children should also have the opportunity to do this, for example, by a suitable system of taxation based on the whole family, and not only on the two spouses.\nOur objective is to achieve full equality where this is possible and where this is essential, in other words - everywhere. Discrimination at work and in society must become history. In the European Union, women and men are of equal dignity and have equal rights, and defence of these rights is a job for us, too, for the European Parliament.\nMy wish for all ladies present in the European Parliament is that every day could be thei", "2001 discharge procedure\nPresident. -\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following reports:\nA5-0072/2003 by Mr Ole B.

Eritrean refugees held hostage in Sinai\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the subject of Eritrean refugees held hostage in Sinai.\nMarietje Schaake\nauthor. - Mr President, about 250 Eritrean migrants are believed to be held hostage in the Sinai desert and inhumane treatment and rape are reported while these people await a ransom that needs to be paid to human traffickers for their release.\nRecent events are part of a network smuggling sub-Saharan migrants through Egypt to Israel that has been operating in the Sinai since 2007. The Egyptian authorities are making welcome efforts to investigate the information provided by the UNHCR. Diplomatic procedures with the Egyptian authorities should be stepped up by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to eliminate the trafficking networks and prevent people from being smuggled.\nAt the same time, Egypt should improve the treatment of refugees according to international standards. This means that, during the justified defence of borders, no excessive or even lethal force should be used against immigrants or refugees, and this advice is something that we might also give ourselves in the EU once in a while.\nDavid-Maria Sassoli\nMr President, the situation is very serious. We think that this issue - which is also being trailed by Europe's media - ought to be dealt with by the European Union and by Parliament, as well as urging the Commission to look into it, since it is a real humanitarian emergency.\nIn this case, the Member States must do everything to try and help these refugees to leave that territory and we think that they could be accepted in European states. We call on the Commission to do everything possible to carry out this action, including using the funds available through the European Fund for Refugees.\nCharles Tannock\nauthor. - Mr President, the ECR Group condemns the appalling treatment being suffered by these innocent and mainly Eritrean victims of what amounts to a modern-day", "Question Time (Commission) \nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B7-0307/2010).\nThe following questions are addressed to the Commission.\nPart one\n\nSubject: Process and outcome of local elections in Belarus\nBelarus held a round of elections to its local councils at the end of April 2010. There were a number of reports on violations of democratic electoral principles and procedures. Although more than 21 000 seats on local councils were being contested, there were only an estimated 360 opposition candidates competing against the pro-government candidates.\nWhat position has the Commission taken vis-\u00e0-vis the above-mentioned elections? Has there been any improvement in terms of democratic standards as compared to the previous elections? What is the position of the Commission concerning the ongoing violations of human rights in the country? How does the Commission assess the political and human rights situation in Belarus in the run-up to the presidential elections in 2011?\n\u0160tefan F\u00fcle\nMember of the Commission. - In response to the important and topical question from Ms Andrikien\u0117, let me say that the Commission is fully aware of all the violations of the democratic principles and procedures which have been reported by a number of NGOs in the context of the local elections in Belarus. The European Union's heads of mission in Minsk have also pointed to inconsistencies and indeed discrepancies, in particular, in the ballot counting.\nSome amendments were made, ahead of the elections, to the Belarus electoral code. According to the opinion of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, which was issued on 3 June 2010, this represented, and I quote, 'a step towards removing some flaws' in the electoral code. However, the report states that these amendments are unlikely to resolve the concerns that the electoral code continues to fall short of genuinely democratic elections.\nIn the light of this, during the visit I intend to pay to Minsk in July, I will ", "10. ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly (vote) \n- Cornillet report\n- Before the vote on paragraph 9:\nThierry Cornillet \nrapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, our fellow Member, Mrs Morgantini, has also tabled an oral amendment and I suggest combining the two. It would, therefore, be a matter of accepting Mrs Morgantini's oral amendment and completing it with the following part sentence: 'and to call upon the international community to ensure the actual implementation of this multinational force'. The two amendments would complete each other to make just one only.\nLuisa Morgantini\n(IT) Mr President, I would like to say that I am willing to accept Mr Cornillet's proposal.\n(The oral amendments were accepted)\n", "Explanations of vote (continuation) \n- Oral explanation of vote:\nKrisztina Morvai\n(HU) The European Ombudsman's report does not reflect the experiences that I have had as a human rights lawyer in Hungary. It does not mention that in autumn 2006, the police, orchestrated by the government, injured, imprisoned and subjected to sham criminal proceedings several hundred peaceful pedestrians and demonstrators commemorating a special event. The EU has remained silent. It is also saying nothing about the fact that since then, the police have been regularly, and illegally, checking the papers of those demonstrating for change, as well as recording them on video, illegally harassing them and often arbitrarily arresting them.\nIt is also 'thanks' to the European Union's outrageous passive stance that 16 opposition activists have currently been held in custody for months on suspicion of a 'terrorist act'. Their 'principal crime' is that they set up a movement for disclosing acts of corruption committed by the government. The manner in which their homes have been searched and possessions confiscated, along with the constant, blatant violation of their rights as detainees, totally contravenes European human rights norms.\nFor example, random, intimidating house searches have been carried out by large numbers of masked commandos, without any authorised person of trust or other guarantee. Computers have been confiscated with a complete disregard for legal guidelines and without any expert record made of the data currently stored, allowing the authorities to falsify evidence and settle scores again with political opponents. We are expecting definite intervention from the EU.

Lisbon Strategy (vote) \nBefore the vote on Amendment 28 (concerns the vote on Amendment 27):\nPervenche Ber\u00e8s\n(FR) Madam President, I may be mistaken but I think that you have held a vote on Amendment 27 which, in reality, was a technical amendment that simply asked for paragraph 47 to be moved. On the other hand, there is a request for a separate roll-call vote on the original text.\nI therefore believe that we have agreed to move paragraph 47, and we now need a two-part roll-call vote on paragraph 47 itself.\nPresident\nLet us clarify matters: there was no objection to paragraph 47 being inserted after paragraph 49. We then voted on Amendment 27, which has been adopted. We could not therefore vote on paragraph 47, as we have voted on Amendment 27. There is therefore no problem.\n", "Tribute\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, on behalf of our President, Mr P\u00f6ttering, I must sadly inform you of the death of the former European Commissioner George Thomson, who later became Lord Thomson of Monifieth.

I wish to ask my fellow Members to please be advised that the new wording of paragraph 2a of the recital appears mistakenly on the voting list. I withdrew those of my proposals that concerned extending the Agency's remit to include the second pillar. On the other hand, the proposal which I retained and which appears on the voting list, replacing the proposed text of paragraph 3a of the recital, now has a new number, paragraph 3.\nI am asking my fellow Members to please cast their votes accordingly. If you deem it justified, Mr President, I shall read the short wording of the proposal to be voted on. With your permission and for the sake of simplicity, I will read it in French.\n(FR) 'The Agency's remit enables it to provide protection for human rights not only in the field of terrorism and organised crime but also in other fields, such as trafficking in persons, offences against children, illicit drug and arms trafficking and corruption and fraud, where measures can also weaken the effectiveness of the protection of human rights'.\nThank you, Mr President, and may I also apologise, of course, to the House.\n- Before the final vote:\nMagda K\u00f3s\u00e1n\u00e9 Kov\u00e1cs \nMr President, I shall repeat a question to Vice-President Frattini that my honourable colleague has already asked: do you intend to accept all the amendments that the House has just adopted, or would you like more time to present some final compromise proposals?\nFranco Frattini\nI believe a little more time will be needed to consult with the Council, as the rapporteur said.\nMagda K\u00f3s\u00e1n\u00e9 Kov\u00e1cs \nMr President, I naturally accept Mr Frattini's reply, and the process will remain the same.\n(Parliament decided to postpone the vote and the matter is therefore considered referred back to the competent committee ", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 25 October 2001.\n\nAnnouncement by the President\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, since our last session, Spain has once again, unfortunately, been cruelly struck by terrorism. On 7 November, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Lid\u00f3n Corbi, a judge and professor of law in the Basque region, was murdered in a cowardly attack whilst leaving his home in Getxo.\nThe previous day in Madrid, terrorists set off a car bomb, in which a hundred or so people were injured.\nOn my own behalf, and on that of the European Parliament, I immediately sent my deepest condolences to the victim' s family and our best wishes for a speedy recovery to everyone who was injured in this attack.\nYet again, ETA terrorists have shown that they deny the right to life, that they reject the very principle of the rule of law. By attacking a judge this time, the terrorists are demonstrating this once more.\nYesterday, Algeria was struck by catastrophic weather conditions, which so far have claimed 538 lives and left 316 injured.\nI immediately expressed our deep sorrow to the Algerian people for the disaster that has struck Algiers, and our total solidarity for the human tragedy that the country is suffering. I also asked President Bouteflika to pass on a message on our behalf to express our deepest sympathy to the victims' families and loved-ones. I hope very much that the European Union will play an active part in supplying emergency aid, which must be sent as soon as possible.\nYesterday, three journalists were killed in an ambush by the Taliban in Afghanistan. Johanne Sutton, Pierre Billaud and Volker Handloik died whilst carrying out their profession, which was also their passion.

I shall now give the floor to the rapporteur, and could I ask the Members who are standing here in front of me to kindly make their way to the exit.\nPervenche Ber\u00e8s\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after 20 months of work, the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis is about to bring its work to an end, and yet the crisis is not over. I would like to take this opportunity to really thank my colleagues and to acknowledge the collective work that we have been able to achieve and the confidence you have placed in me.\nWe are concluding our work at a time when the economic governance package is stalled, at a time when the financial markets have once again taken up many of their bad habits, including in terms of the distribution of bonuses, and at a time when the fate of Member States depends on the ratings they are given by the credit rating agencies. It is a difficult environment, and that is why we are asking you, Commissioner, to conduct a public debt audit.\nIn this report, I believe we have fulfilled our mandate. We say that we need more Europe. This message may sound odd in some capitals as we now feel that the capitals are wary of Europe, precisely because it has sometimes appeared to act too late and do too little.\nWe say that we need this integration.

Eight months ago, we also suggested that you", "Explanations of vote\nPresident\n- Let us proceed to the explanations of votes.\nSiiri Oviir\n- (ET) Following repeated demands from Parliament, the Commission has submitted a regulation on the financing of security fees.

The consumer needs to be sure that revenue obtained from security fees is used exclusively for covering security expenses.\nJaroslav Pa\u0161ka\n- (SK) In my opinion, it is right for the European Commission and the European Parliament to be involved in regulating charges for passenger safety and protection in air transport.\nHowever, I have to say that I consider the current approach of establishing bodies to perform such controls to be nonsensical and incorrect. At a time when Europe needs money to help Greece, and at a time when Europe needs money for economic development, establishing new bodies that will do practically nothing beyond some kind of supervision is playing fast and loose with EU citizens' money, and I believe that it will not produce a successful result.\nBogus\u0142aw Liberadzki\n(PL) Mr President, I would like to express my satisfaction at being able to vote in favour of extending the force of the regulation as it concerns spare parts for cars, in terms of access of car users both to certified and uncertified parts.

Sheep and goat farming is even more important in remote areas and in mountainous regions, where it is often depended on from an economic and agricultural perspective. It does not adversely impact the environment and it protects the rural landscape.\nBut yet, the future of this industry is currently under pressure in the European Union. Sheep production has fallen 12.5% since 2000. Farmers are leaving this occupation as the work is hard and income is too low. Sheepmeat consumption is in decline, as some feel it is too expensive and difficult to cook. This is particularly true among younger people. There is also increased competition in the market from other countries.\nSheepmeat production will fall 10% by the year 2015 unless something is done now. This sector should be looked at under the CAP 'Health Check', and prompt action should be taken.\nMr President, since being appointed rapporteur for this report in June 2007, I have opened up a wide-ranging series of discussions with interested parties, including farming organisations, representatives from the lamb-processing sector and consumer organisations. Ernst and Young compiled a very thorough study of the sheep and goat sectors, for which I would like to thank them. I consulted with the Agriculture Commissioner, Mrs Fischer Boel, and various European agriculture ministers, who were all very supportive to me in compiling this report. At all times I try to remain realistic in the proposals I put forward.\nVery briefly I would highlight the main recommendations of the report.\nFirstly, the introduction of a new environmental sheep-maintenance scheme whic", "Public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Cappato, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents (implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001).\nMarco Cappato\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a report on the status of public access to European Union documents and also an opportunity to make some suggestions. In the short time we have available, I want to raise three important points.\nThe first is about the Council. European Union governments meet in the Council with law-making powers and, like any law-making assembly, they should be bound to make their work and their decisions public. I wish to emphasise this particularly because amendments have been tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for a split vote on certain paragraphs. I hope the split votes are not taken to delete significant portions of the report. For example, paragraph 3 of the report asks for action to be taken following the judgment in the case brought by Maurizio Turco, a former Radical Party MEP, who won a case in the Court of Justice over the publicising of legal decisions taken by the legal services of European institutions and also over the obligation to disclose the identity of Member State delegations to the Council. We are entitled to know who is voting in the Council and how. I therefore hope that no one will vote against this paragraph 3, or paragraph 9, which asks for information about what is happening within Coreper, the Committee of Permanent Representatives, and asks that they should disclose the meeting documents and not secrete all the international policy papers away as diplomatic documents. This is a very important point!\nThe other point we raise concerns Parliament, our Parliament, because we must be the first to publicise what we a", "Address by the President of Parliament\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, having welcomed our fellow Members from Bulgaria and Romania, I would like to take a few minutes to assess the work that we have done during the first half of this term in office.\nI believe that there is a broad consensus with regard to the increasing importance of the European Parliament and the greater role it is playing. The duties carried out by the European Parliament are now better known and more recognised. We have overcome the challenge of enlargement and solved significant internal problems.\nThis is due to the work of all of you, of the Secretary-General and of Parliament's Administration. I would like to thank all of you.\nI would also like to remind you of the doubts we had thirty months ago about our capacity to operate with more Members, with nine more languages - there are now twelve more languages - and with even more diverse parliamentary cultures.\nI believe that we can state now that we have overcome those difficulties and that the enlarged Parliament is working properly. There has been no division between the old and the new Europe.\nThe Members from the new Member States have integrated perfectly into the different transnational political groups, working within the system and from a European point of view.\nWe have played an important role in terms of easing East-West tensions, and that has made it possible for us to reach important agreements, the Services Directive being an excellent example.\nMembers from the ten new Member States have held some of the highest political positions in our Parliament and many of them have acted as rapporteurs.\nI hope that they will continue to participate in this integrated fashion in the future.\nYou will also remember that, at the beginning of the term in office, I told you that the Members' Statute would be a priority. Some of the most experienced Members were rather sceptical, but we now have a Statute that, when it is applied, will guarantee eq", "Order of business\nPresident\nThe final draft agenda drawn up on Thursday, 4 March 2010 by the Conference of Presidents pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed. The following amendments have been proposed:\nMonday:\nNo changes.\nTuesday:\nNo changes.\nWednesday:\nThe Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left have made a request to add a Commission statement on the 'Amflora' variety of genetically modified potato.\nRebecca Harms\n(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have once again moved for the subject of the licensing of the genetically modified potato Amflora to be put on the agenda for various reasons. After the Commissioner for Health became responsible for the licensing of genetically modified organisms, in my opinion, citizens thought that we would now approach the licensing of such GMOs with greater care. The opposite is the case. So soon after the Commission took office, I consider it a scandal that by licensing the potato, the Commissioner for Health has explicitly ignored the concerns of the World Health Organisation.\nMoreover, in the previous legislative period, time and again, there was great disagreement between the Council and the Commission on the licensing procedures, because many Member States did not agree with the licensing offensive that Commission President Barroso himself promoted. We had agreed to develop another prudent procedure for licensing. Where is this procedure now? Since the majority of citizens are against these genetically modified organisms, we have a duty to hold a debate this week on this licensing and the offensive that is perhaps still trundling towards us.\n(The President cut off the speaker)\nI would like to ask for a roll-call vote on this.\nFrancesco Enrico Speroni\n(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, apart from any possible assessments by individual Members or political groups, I believe it is appropriate that we should be a", "Security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Coelho, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004 on standards for security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents issued by Member States - C6-0359/2007 -.\nCarlos Coelho\nMr President, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal we are discussing today is aimed at changing the regulations approved in 2004, which improved and harmonised the security regulations relating to the protection of EU citizens' passports and travel documents against fraudulent use, at the same time as it introduced elements of biometric identification. Contrary to the procedure in 2004, we are now in codecision. I want to thank the French Presidency and Commissioner Barrot for the enormous commitment they have made in this case with a view to reaching agreement at first reading. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their work and their cooperation, which have been indispensable in obtaining this result.\nThis solution was necessary, if we bear in mind that this regulation came into force in 2004, and as from June this year at the latest, all the Member States would have to collect the fingerprints of children from birth. However, according to the existing studies resulting from pilot projects conducted in several Member States, it is very difficult to take or even rely on fingerprints of children under six years of age. It is true that the national legislature could create derogations from this obligation. However, that would mean that up to the age limit for which that exemption was granted only temporary passports could be issued. It would be an excessive burden for parents to have to obtain a passport for each of their children whenever they wanted to travel outside the Schengen a", "36. Rates of excise duty on alcohol and alcoholic beverages (vote) \nReport: Astrid Lulling\n- Before the vote\nAstrid Lulling \nrapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to draw your attention to this report for just a moment, as the procedure is very complicated.\nFor the sake of clarity, I shall make it clear to all those who want to avoid any increase in the minimum rates on beer and spirits that they should vote against all the amendments adopted in committee except one, adopted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs by a small, chance majority of 21 to 19. I am asking you, in any case, whatever the result of the vote, to reject all of my report and so maintain the status quo in relation to excise duty on alcohol, until we have the Commission's report, given that Mr Kov\u00e0cs wishes to make proposals on the whole excise duty policy at the end of the year.\nI would remind you again that Winston Churchill said:\n'There is no such thing as a good text'.\n(Applause)\n(FR) I should like to add to that there is nothing worse than pointlessly increasing taxes at the wrong time. Therefore, please, follow me with regard to this vote and anyway, reject the report!\n(Applause)\nPresident\nThank you, Mrs Lulling. The House is obviously grateful for your advice.\nPervenche Ber\u00e8s \nChairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (FR) Madam President, the House will recall that we had to refer this text back for further discussion because, following conflicting votes, our rapporteur had called for a vote against.\nThe Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs carried out a serious piece of work, which, obviously, does not correspond with our rapporteur's opinion and no doubt she ought to have withdrawn her name from the final result.

Water shortages have spread beyond the traditionally arid areas. Access to water, the quality of which is constantly deteriorating, has become a concern for all of us. The UN figures speak for themselves. One billion people do not have access to safe drinking water; two and a half billion people do not have access to sanitation; five thousand children under the age of six die every day from diseases caused by lack of clean drinking water or sanitation, or by their poor quality.\nThe scandal is that the first victims are always the poorest. Access to water, which will be one of the main challenges in the years to come, could further delay the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The next World Water Forum must be an opportunity to find solutions together to respond to this enormous challenge.\nMy first priority was to emphasise that water is a shared resource of mankind that should be a universal right. That is the first paragraph of the proposed re", "7. Human Rights in the World 2007 and the EU's policy on the matter (\n- Before the vote on Amendment 3:\nHannes Swoboda\non behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, may I simply make the following statement on behalf of my group: we wish to withdraw this Amendment 3. We continue to take the view that non-violence is, unfortunately, not always enough to ensure respect for human rights - I would merely recall Kosovo and Darfur here - but that should not imply that we are against the principle of non-violence. We therefore wish to withdraw our amendment. We will vote for the amendment tabled by the PPE-DE Group and proceed on that basis.\n- Before the vote on Amendment 7:\nMarco Cappato\nrapporteur. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to thank Mr Swoboda of the Socialist Group for having withdrawn this amendment, for the sake of simplification, and also for clarifying that the proposal is not, in a manner of speaking, the only instrument.\nI should like to table an oral amendment on the amendment put forward by the PPE-DE Group, also aimed at simplification: the beginning of the paragraph would read as follows: 'considers non-violence to be the most appropriate means', and the rest of the paragraph would remain as it stands. I would also ask that the word 'non-violence' be written as a single word in all language versions, because it is not merely a negative concept indicating the absence of violence, but a positive concept of action, as the Dalai Lama, Gandhi and other historical figures have taught us.\n(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)\n- Before the vote on paragraph 23:\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Flautre\n(FR) Madam President, I wish to propose an oral amendment to paragraph 23, with the agreement of our rapporteur, to state the following:\n'notes with concern that during the last year of activities that new body has not proved its credibility but stresses once again the crucial role of the UNHCR within the overall UN architecture;'.\n(Parliament agreed ", "Resumption of the session\nPresident.\n I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 25 April 2002.\n\nPresident.\nColleagues, on 6 May Pim Fortuyn, a Dutch politician and candidate in this week's general election in the Netherlands was shot dead in Hilversum. The same day, on my own behalf and on behalf of this House, I condemned this murder unreservedly and expressed our profound solidarity with the Dutch people and with the victim's family, friends and colleagues.\nFreedom of expression is one of our most fundamental and cherished rights - a core value of our democracies. As democrats we defend the right of every person to participate in political life freely and to exercise his or her democratic right. That includes the right to express one's ideas, whether or not we like these ideas. That is precisely the basis of our democratic system.\nIn condemnation of this, and all acts of political violence whenever, wherever and by whomsoever they are perpetrated, I would like to ask you to observe one minute's silence.\n(The House rose and observed one minute's silence)\n\nPresident. On behalf of the European Parliament I should also like to welcome the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest.\n\nDaw Aung San Suu Kyi is a laureate of the Sakharov Prize of this House in 1990 and a Nobel Prize laureate of 1991. She has always been a figurehead for the fight for democracy, freedom and human rights in her own country in particular. This release and her right to again lead her party political life is a significant step forward to the establishment of democracy in Burma. I hope it will soon be followed by the release of Burma's remaining political prisoners.\nI heard the call of Aung San Suu Kyi last week for a European Union common policy on Burma. I expressed the hope on behalf of our House that this release will be followed by the development of such a policy in active cooperation with the European Parliament. We look forward to welcoming her", "Credit rating agencies (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on:\nthe oral question to the Commission by Nikolaos Chountis and J\u00fcrgen Klute, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on credit rating agencies - B7-0302/2010),\nthe oral question to the Commission by Udo Bullmann, on behalf of the S&D Group, on credit rating agencies - B7-0309/2010),\nthe oral question to the Commission by Jean-Paul Gauz\u00e8s, on behalf of the PPE Group, on credit rating agencies - B7-0312/2010), and\nthe oral question to the Commission by Sylvie Goulard, on behalf of the ALDE Group, on credit rating agencies - B7-0313/2010).\nNikolaos Chountis\nMr President, today's debate in the European Parliament concerns the activities of credit rating agencies and the impact they have on the global and European economy. The European Union and the European Central Bank have issued regulations granting credit rating agencies, such as Moody's, SnP and Fitch, the right to evaluate not only businesses but also the Member States of the European Union themselves.\nWhen the crisis broke, the same institutions of the European Union recognised the very negative role played by credit rating agencies. Whereas one would have expected the European Commission to limit the role of these agencies, on the contrary, their role was upgraded and formalised in a new regulation in November 2009.\nCredit rating agencies had already started to downgrade Greece's credit rating at the beginning of 2009 and, as a result, it pays double the interest rate it paid before and has entered a vicious circle of depreciation and speculative borrowing. We all know what the final results were. Just yesterday, Moody's tried yet again to generate a negative climate for the Greek economy and the euro with a blatant speculative intervention, by downgrading the state of the Greek economy by 4 points for no good reason.\nMoody's is one of the three private US companies which the European Union officially recognises for the purpose of rating the Member", "Health care systems in Sub-Saharan Africa and Global Health (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs De Keyser, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on health care systems in sub-Saharan Africa and global health.\nV\u00e9ronique De Keyser\nMadam President, Commissioner, thank you for having stayed this far. This report actually responds to a communication from the Commission on global health, but we wanted to adopt an angle that was rather exceptional and concentrate a good deal more on the mutual schemes that are currently thriving in Africa. Allow me to digress a little.\nThe state of health in Africa is actually quite dreadful, despite all the international aid, and this is due to a large number of factors, whether they be climate change, the financial crisis, war, bad governance in certain countries, or the greed that is provoked by the very riches found in Africa. Add to this the major pandemics such as Aids, malaria, tuberculosis, and so on, and this set of factors means that we find ourselves facing a genuine disaster.\nSo I must first of all pay tribute to the work of the NGOs and of certain churches too, which are doing a truly remarkable job in emergency conditions, in conflict zones, but this cannot represent a long-term response, it is not a sustainable response.\nThere are what are called vertical funds, which have been mentioned and which are used to fight major diseases, such as Aids, malaria and tuberculosis, for example. They attract a lot of money and are quite attractive to private aid efforts, since people feel they are giving to a cause that is being kept well under control. In reality, however, these funds too, while certainly achieving their objective, cover only a small part of the problem, because, unfortunately, more deaths are still caused in Africa today by the lack of sanitary infrastructure, the lack of drinking water - children die of dysentery - or the lack of a local dispensary, than, alas, by Aids or malaria.\nH", "\nMatikainen-Kallstr\u00f6m\nMadam President, as we are voting on these agricultural reforms, the Agenda 2000 reforms, I would just like to inform my colleagues that it has been over fifty degrees below zero in Finland this week. Such conditions are worth noting, as cars and other kinds of machinery are frozen solid.\n\nHawlicek\nMadam President, I have a point of order on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media. At the sitting of Wednesday, 13 January 1999 in Strasbourg, Commissioner Bangemann spoke on the Malerba report on globalisation and the information society. The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media is sorry to see that Mr Bangemann is apparently so afraid of it that he felt obliged to exercise his prerogatives under the Rules of Procedure and criticise the committee as a whole for having presumed to express its own views on the substance of the report in the form of a letter.\nBut the committee members can be forgiving of Mr Bangemann's remarks. The Committee on Culture is happy that its principal comments on the Green Paper on convergence were taken on board last October. Mr Bangemann must have been sorely disappointed to find that a committee which he regards as so insignificant was in fact able to push through its main ideas on convergence.\n\nPresident\nThank you, Mrs Hawlicek. I note what you have just said, but Mr Bangemann is not here to give you an answer.\n\nFayot\nMadam President, I would like to say that the acoustics in this room are very bad. We can hardly hear you without the headphones. The technical services should deal with this, as the situation is absolutely intolerable.\n\nPresident\nYou are quite right, Mr Fayot. You will know that several of us have raised the question of the acoustics here in the Chamber.\nI would make two comments in response to what you have said. Firstly, the Bureau has given the matter consideration, and we have called in a firm to see how the acoustics can be improved. Secondly, I would ask ", "\n(1) \nPatakis (GUE/NGL ).\n\u00a0\u00a0  Mr President, today, and over the next few days, dozens of farmers from Karditsa, Trikala, Larissa and Magnisia in Thessalia and from other areas of Greece will stand in the dock accused of having taken part in rural demonstrations held in order to rebuff the all-out attack on them from the common agricultural policy and avoid being wiped out, so that they can stay on their land and in their villages.\nThe previous government responded to the reasonable demands of the farmers with hundreds of rural tribunals, which were set up throughout the country and sentenced farmers in order to break their fighting spirit. Governments come and go but the rural tribunals stay. The criminalisation of rural demonstrations is designed to terrorise the fighters of poor and middle-class farming into stopping their fight to overturn this policy, which has brought such hardship to Mediterranean products and to their income and has resulted in the abandonment of the countryside. The new Greek Government which, when in opposition, said that it disagreed with these prosecutions, is keeping quiet like a new Pontius Pilate.\nFrom this tribune we condemn the pogrom continuing even today of the fighters of the rural movement and we demand an immediate end to it. It is certain that no trial or sentence will break their fighting spirit. The poor farmers will fight to stay in their villages and on their land, they will continue their productive activity, because it is a question of life for them and their families. \nPresident. \u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:\n\u2013 Report (A5-0120/2004) by Mr\u00a0Obiols i Germ\u00e0, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of a Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republics of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Hondur", "Space and security (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Karl von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on space and security (INI/2008/2030).\nKarl von Wogau\nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the European Commission, ladies and gentlemen, operations under the Security and Defence Policy are becoming more dangerous. That has been shown by the fact that for the first time a soldier has been killed during an operation under European command. Gilles Polin was killed on the border between Chad and Darfur.\nWe must, therefore, consider whether some of those risks can be avoided. They arise as a result of the wrong kind of command structures, but also when the necessary equipment is not available for specific operations.\nWhen we consider this matter, we start with Javier Solana's broad approach to security strategy, which covers the armed forces and also the European Union's critical infrastructure, its external borders and humanitarian operations as well. Here we keep finding weaknesses in the area of space, satellite-based reconnaissance, satellite-based telecommunications and satellite-based navigation. If we cooperate more closely in this area, we will be able to spend our money more usefully and achieve greater efficiency.\nI will start with reconnaissance. We have the Helios reconnaissance satellites, the German SAR Lupe ones and the Italian Cosmo-Skymed. It is vital to ensure that the imagery received from these reconnaissance satellites is actually available to our satellite centre in Torrej\u00f3n.\nThen there is the MUSIS project, planned for the future. In the report I urge that this project eventually be brought within an appropriate European framework. Then we have satellite navigation, the Galileo project. The report states quite clearly that the Galileo project should also be available in future for military operations, because our military forces that plan and conduct such operations need Galileo to give them directi", "Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes\n\nMarco Cappato\n(IT) Mr President, the Bureau of this Parliament officially informed us of the fact that MEPs' attendances in committee and plenary sessions were to be made public on the European Parliament website. This was, incidentally, a move in response to a specific vote taken by this Parliament during its January session, when we voted for this, that is, for this information to be made public.\nSo, Mr President, I have a request for you: since the Bureau is likely to hold only one or two more meetings at most in due course, to ensure that the will of this Parliament is respected, I formally request that you undertake to confirm that both this will and the vote taken by this House will be respected. I would not like to think that entirely bureaucratic reasons have prevented this requirement for transparency from being observed, because we made a commitment to the European electorate and public too.\nPresident\nThank you very much. Parliament's will is always decisive. We will consider what you had to say in the next meeting of the Bureau.\nAnna Z\u00e1borsk\u00e1\n(FR) Mr President, a law on women's rights which, according to the Afghan senator Humeira Namati, is worse than that which was in force at the time of the Taliban, has been signed by President Hamid Karzai.\nThis text makes it legal for a husband to rape his wife and forbids women from going out, working or visiting the doctor without the husband's permission. In addition, the law grants custody of children only to the father and grandfather.\nI call on you, Mr President, immediately to take all the measures necessary to express the total disapproval of our Parliament and to include this item under urgent business for our next session.\n(Applause)\nPresident\nThank you, Mrs Z\u00e1borsk\u00e1. We will take care of this matter.\n", "Ratification of the ILO's 2006 Consolidated Maritime Labour Convention (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mary Lou McDonald, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision authorising the Member States to ratify, in the interests of the European Community, the 2006 Consolidated Maritime Labour Convention of the International Labour Organisation C6-0241/2006.\nJacques Barrot\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, the International Labour Organisation has adopted the ambitious Maritime Labour Convention, which lays down minimum standards for working conditions on board: employment conditions, accommodation conditions, social security protection and welfare, not forgetting provisions for implementation.\nThe added value of this Convention, a real beginning for a code for international maritime labour, lies in that it makes the existing standards more effective, that it adapts them to globalisation, and above all that it makes it possible to increase the number of ratifications by States. The Commission, like the ILO (International Labour Organisation), considers that the goal of a level playing field is fundamental. We are convinced that the Maritime Labour Convention will contribute to that, eliminate shipping that does not respect minimum standards and make careers at sea more attractive.\nThe Convention must, however, be ratified speedily in order to produce these positive effects. A decision authorising Member States to ratify the Convention is legally required given that the ILO's current rules do not allow the Community as such to ratify the text, even if it includes provisions that fall within the competence of the Community.\nIn order to avoid delaying the ratification procedures, the Commission has endeavoured to present its proposal for a decision hard on the heels of the adoption of the Convention.\nIn its proposal, the Commission anticipates the principle of authorisation to ratify and suggests 31", "Democratic scrutiny under the Development Cooperation Instrument (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on democratic scrutiny under the Development Cooperation Instrument\nBenita Ferrero-Waldner\nMember of the Commission. Madam President, honourable Members, it is a great pleasure to be here. I would like to thank Parliament and, in particular, the members of the Development Committee for the constructive dialogue that we have been able to conduct in the framework of the democratic scrutiny of our draft strategy papers.\nI have on several occasions, notably in my joint letter with my colleague, Louis Michel, to the chair of the Development Committee of 26 March, reiterated our commitment to carefully examining the committee's observations on the strategy papers in the preparation of the annual action programmes and in the implementation of our projects and programmes. We are now in the preparation phase of these programmes. Some of them have already been forwarded to you and the remaining ones will be sent to you by this autumn in conformity with Article 8 of the Comitology Decision. Attached to these annual action programmes, you will also receive synoptic tables explaining in detail how your observations have been taken into account or why it was not feasible to do so.\nAdditionally, this week in a separate letter to Mr Borrell, I illustrated the manner in which we have considered your remarks and how these have been transposed in the annual action programmes that have already been sent to you. I am therefore somewhat disappointed to hear of a motion for a resolution critical of the Commission's programming. I would hope that this will not call into question the spirit of open dialogue and cooperation that we are displaying and that we are ready to continue to pursue.\nPlease allow me now to address some of the issues raised by the Parliament on several occasions, notably in your motion for a resolution. We are, of course, fully committed to the", "One-minute speeches (Rule 150) \nPresident\nThe next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance (Rule 150).\nElena B\u0103sescu\n(RO) First of all, I would like to express my sympathy to those who are suffering as a result of the floods in Romania.\nTwenty-three people have died and more than 18 000 have been evacuated. The floods have affected 530 locations in 37 counties, roughly 9 000 homes and 60 000 hectares of arable land, as well as 41 national roads. The losses are continuing to mount up every day.\nOne priority at the moment is the building of a 4.5 km-long dam in Gala\u0163i to protect this port city from the Danube overflowing. If the dam fails to hold, this will cause a real disaster. More than 8 000 people will be affected, as well as the biggest economic operators in Gala\u0163i.\nThe Romanian Government announced that it is going to submit the documentation for accessing the European Union Solidarity Fund by 15 July. I call on the European Commission, once it has made a precise evaluation of the losses sustained, to make resources from this fund available to Romania as soon as possible.\nAlf Svensson\n(SV) Mr President, our media are currently full of all the cuts and savings that need to be made for countries to be able to manage the debts that have been inflicted upon the people. In itself, it is understandable that a lot is being written about this, but there are, of course, those who have nothing to cut back on because they do not have any resources at all. Many of these people, our fellow human beings, live in Africa. The television cameras will soon be turned away from the South Africa of the football World Cup. I hope that we can then focus a new light on the poor countries south of the Sahara. We need to do something, because it is scandalous that people are dying of starvation and thirst, and do not even have anything to keep body and soul together. I therefore believe that we need to have the courage to tear down the walls between private en", "11. Homophobia in Europe (vote) \n- Motion for a resolution:\n- Before the vote:\nZbigniew Zaleski\n(DE) Mr President, before we vote, I would like to make a brief observation. In terms of semantics, the content of the resolution does not correspond to the concept of homophobia. The word in the title has been incorrectly used.\n- Before the vote on paragraph 12a:\nKathalijne Maria Buitenweg\nMr President, following the debate on the Commission statement, we would like to update the motion for a resolution by adding a new paragraph 12a which would read: 'Welcomes the fact that the European Commission has started the procedure for a new directive that would enlarge the scope of Directive 2000/78/EC on equal treatment in employment and social occupation to include areas of discrimination outside the labour market;'.\n(The oral amendment was not accepted)\n", "Guaranteeing independent impact assessments (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Niebler, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on guaranteeing independent impact assessments.\nAngelika Niebler\nMr President, Mrs Reding, ladies and gentlemen, let me perhaps introduce the topic with a few examples. Greece and other states are heavily in debt, although billions from the structural funds have been poured into these countries for many years. How can we improve the use of these resources and how can the utilisation of these resources be better controlled?\nMy second example relates to Eurobonds. What effect do they have on the European budget?\nThirdly, if we were to introduce a financial transaction tax in Europe, what would the consequences be? For all these questions, Parliament demands in its reports that a regulatory impact assessment be carried out. After all, we need facts in order to be able to take politically sound decisions. That is what my report on improving the guarantee of independent impact assessments is all about.\nThis is not a new issue. It has occupied us, together with other issues concerning the improvement of legislation, for over ten years. However, despite all the efforts of the Commission to improve its impact assessment as well as those that we have made in this regard in the European Parliament, the quality of the impact assessment is still in need of improvement. My report puts forward proposals for how, with regard to the European Commission and the impact assessments that it carries out, as well as with regard to Parliament's impact assessment studies, we can succeed in bringing about this improvement.\nIn terms of its content, the report is divided into four sections. Firstly, there are general requirements for impact assessments at European level. The second section contains proposals directed at the European Commission and it lists potential areas where improvements can be made. In the third section, I dis", "Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting\nIlda Figueiredo\n(PT) Mr President, I have a point of order. This morning we held a vote here to justify negotiations that existed between the European Union and Morocco. Since a Commission document has just come out, dated today, saying that EU - Morocco negotiations on the agri-food and fisheries sectors are progressing, I should like to know if it was these negotiations that the Chairman of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament was referring to this morning when he used the negotiations as an argument to delete from today's agenda the topic on Aminatou Haidar, the Sahrawi fighter who has been on hunger strike for 32 days and is in a life-threatening condition at this very moment. This, then, is a point that needs to be duly clarified, because what happened here this morning is unacceptable.\nPresident\nThank you, Mrs Figueiredo. Unfortunately, I cannot give you an answer, because I can no longer remember myself what the group chair said at midday today.\nIzaskun Bilbao Barandica\n(ES) Mr President, two items were withdrawn from the agenda this morning. I wish to enquire about the resolution agreed between the parliamentary groups. Could you please clarify under which of the Rules of Procedure was the question raised and an on-the-spot vote taken to withdraw an agenda item we were due to debate this afternoon?\nI believe this is an important issue and that Members of the House present today need to be informed appropriately as a matter of urgency.\nPresident\nMrs Bilbao Barandica, this concerned a point of order under the terms of Rule 140 of the Rules of Procedure which allows the agenda to be changed. I regret that I can now only permit points of order. We will not be restarting this debate. I would like to point out that I will immediately cut off any speaker who attempts to begin the debate again.\nWilly Meyer\n(ES) Mr President, pursuant to Rule 177 of the Rules of Pr", "Human rights in the world 2008 and the EU's policy on the matter (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Obiols i Germ\u00e0, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2008 and the European Union's policy on the matter.\nRaimon Obiols i Germ\u00e0\nrapporteur. - (ES) Madam President, I would like to make some brief comments on the content of this annual report on human rights in the world and the role of the European Union in that field. Firstly, I would like to point out that the report has two different scopes: the first is to describe and assess the situation, which is unfortunately a negative one, of human rights in many countries and regions of the world, often bordering on or entering into the territory of human tragedy; the second is an assessment based on the past experience of this Parliament in the adoption of positions in response to various problems, and also based on a wish on the rapporteur's part for the report to be situated within the mainstream of the positions and acts of the various European Union institutions, not seeking to emphasise elements of disagreement, but rather, at heart, aspects of agreement. This is because the rapporteur believes that achieving convergent positions produces power and effectiveness in this slow and difficult task of improving the state of human rights in the world.\nThere is also a second aspect on which I have placed particular stress, and that is to try to identify specific priorities, or, in other words, to produce a summary of what the basic guiding elements of action by the European Union with regard to human rights throughout the world might be.\nI would set out nine points on this issue which have been clearly picked out by all the contributions made by my fellow Members and by the report's general framework. The first places an urgent priority, if you like, using a term which is a little grandiloquent in historical terms, on the struggle for the definitiv", "Order of business\nPresident\nThe final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Friday, 17 September 2009, pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed.\nMonday:\nThe Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has made a request to remove from the agenda the short presentation of Mrs Gallo's report on enforcement of intellectual property rights in the internal market.\nMartin Schulz\nMr President, our group already pointed out in the Conference of Presidents last week that the Gallo report - an own-initiative report that is very controversial in this House - ought to be reassessed in terms of our continued debating of it. The fact of the matter is that, under the new Rules of Procedure, this report was introduced and voted on very quickly. However, we already have several alternative resolutions that are also being put to the vote. The situation as we see it today is a very confusing one. I would even dare to predict that none of the specified drafts that are to be put to the vote here will ultimately receive a majority vote. That is my first point.\nThe second is that, in the meantime, we have discovered that the Commission's initiatives in the area of copyright will be presented in the next few days. The Commission has decided on a legislative approach and there will be draft directives in the legislative pipeline. This means that, at a time when we are drawing up legislation, we will be voting on an own-initiative report that will surely be overtaken by this legislation.\nTherefore, we are requesting that this item be removed from the agenda.\nMarielle Gallo\nMr President, we cannot accept a further request for a postponement of the vote on this report.\nWith regard to substance, it is wrong to say that there is no consensus, because this report is the result of numerous compromises which have been debated and discussed over a period of several mo", "13. Estimates of revenue and expenditure for 2012 - Section I - Parliament (\nBefore the vote\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Fernandes\nMr President, I would like to make a simple technical correction that does not alter this report in any way. There is a transcription error in Article 400 on own revenue; this article concerns proceeds from taxation on the salaries, wages and allowances of Members of the institutions, officials, other servants and recipients of pensions. The figure given is 48 103 216, whereas the correct figure is 63 103 216.

This package was presented in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs this morning, but we could not proceed to the discussion because of the very tight deadlines, and no report was drawn up. I think it is worrying that Parliament should express an opinion without first having drawn up a report on such an important subject. We are therefore against this shortening of deadlines, because it simply does not allow us to present a reasoned report on such an important subject.\n\nPresident\nThank you, Mr Di Lello Finuoli. It will therefore be recorded in the Minutes that you are not in favour of the decision taken by the Conference of Presidents.\n\nDecision on urgent procedure\nPresident.\nI shall now give the floor to Mr Watson, the chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.\nWatson (ELDR), chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.

Why is this important? Many of the new Member States, among them Romania, for instance, have no legislation for minorities. Last year we witnessed uniformed policemen beating up civilians in Slovakia. Ever since the new government took office in Romania, we have noticed that the symbols of minorities are being removed, that it is seen as a problem if someone speaks more than one language, and that several hundred children were accidentally left out of school enrolment. This is why we think it important for the European Parliament to produce a report, a resolution, guaranteeing the protection of minorities, the protection of traditional ethnic minorities. Thank you very much, Mr President.\nIliana Malinova Iotova\n(BG) Ladies and gentlemen, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the natural gas supply cut in January resulted in heavy losses for a few European countries, especially Bulgaria.\nThe direct losses for the Bulgarian economy for just a few days amounted to more than EUR 230 million, which is equal to the amount needed to start the Nabucco project. This has left our economy in a precarious state and has forced us to seek cooperation in order to reopen the blocks at the Kozloduy nuclear power station.\nThe dialogue on this must be reasonable and calm, and based on good analysis. The solutions are difficult, however, let us not prejudge them and dismiss them outright, as the Commission has unfortunately signalled.\nI consider that Bulgaria and some of the worst affected countries must have the opportunity to gain additional funding from the European Development Plan, and not just a minimal share of the EUR 20 million which has already been allocated for gas projects. ", "Possibility of using gas from alternative sources in Europe (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the possibility of using gas from alternative sources in Europe.\nG\u00fcnther Oettinger\nMadam President, ladies and gentlemen, this agenda item addresses an issue which will certainly be an important concern of ours in the months to come: What will the gas market look like during the next few decades? The question is what role gas will play in the near future in heat generation, conversion to electricity, industry and as a fuel for transport and, therefore, in our energy timetable leading up to 2050, where it will be of huge importance.\nWe also need to consider how the transport routes should be developed, including pipelines, infrastructure and terminals. Other issues include investment costs and the forecasts concerning the gas price in the energy mix. The European gas market currently has a volume of around 520 billion cubic metres per year. Part of this comes from our own deposits in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, but more than 60% of our gas supplies are imported from third countries and this figure will soon reach over 80%. For this reason, new deposits, such as gas in rocks, will be a useful supplement to existing deposits and will therefore reduce our dependency on imports.\nThere is currently a boom in sales of tight gas and shale gas from the USA. Ten years ago, no one would have believed how quickly and how dramatically the production of gas from rocks, which is extracted using water pressure and chemical agents, would transform the market. Until a few years ago, the USA was an importer of gas. Now it is an exporter, even given its own growing demand for gas. Therefore, the gas market, which has always been a continental market, is, for the first time, on the way to becoming a global market, with gas from the USA being supplied to liquid natural gas (LNG) terminals in Europe.\nI am not drawing any conclusions from this development", "German Presidency and the situation in Kosovo\nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council on the programme of the German Presidency and the situation in Kosovo.\nI give the floor to the President-in-Office, Mr Fischer, whom I should like to welcome to the House this morning.\nApplause\n\nFischer\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 1 January 1999 with the introduction of the euro, the common currency, by eleven Member States, Europe took a historic, perhaps even a revolutionary step which will lend a new dimension to the process of European integration. For the first time in the history of the European integration process, that all but miraculous response by the people of Europe to centuries of a precarious balance of power on this continent, of violent attempts to establish hegemony and of terrible wars, an essential component of national sovereignty, monetary sovereignty, has been transferred to a European institution. This act does indeed create a new political dimension. Currency, security and constitution, those are the three essential components of the sovereignty of modern nation states, and the introduction of the euro constituted the first move towards their communitarisation in the EU. The real significance of this step for Europe and international politics will probably only be understood with the passage of time.\nThe introduction of a common currency is not primarily an economic act, but above all a sovereign and thus eminently political act. With the communitarisation of its money, Europe has also opted for an autonomous path into the future and, in close association with our transatlantic partners, for an autonomous role in tomorrow's world. To date, however, the EU has only partly been a political entity and therefore the introduction of a common currency at a time when there is still a political and democratic deficit in the Community will create a field of tension, the dynamic of which will radically change the c", "2. Eligibility of housing interventions in favour of marginalised communities (\nAfter the vote:\nJ\u00f6rg Leichtfried\n(DE) Mr President, I have no problem with the machine.

We have an agreement spanning six political groups, 27 Member States and five very important parliamentary committees. In this way, I believe we are able to send a message to the Commission, the Council and the Member States that must be reckoned with and we have therefore made a great step towards an EU-level effort to alleviate the poverty and social exclusion of our continent's largest ethnic minority.\nA significant proportion of European Roma face such substandard conditions - almost totally disconnected from the economy resulting in their exclusion from basic human rights - that fostering social inclusion cannot be viewed within the framework of general policy ratification but must be handled as bridging one of the most enormous gaps in the fulfilment of constitutional and human rights in Europe.\nThe EU-level effort to alleviate the poverty and social exclusion of European Roma must therefore place its primary emphasis on the fulfilment and promotion of the fundamental rights to employment, housing, healthcare and education.\nLet me briefly outline the most important principles and recommendations of my report. Above all, the strategy must be", "Conclusions of the European Council meeting (25-26 March 2010) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission: Conclusions of the European Council held on 25-26 March 2010.\nHerman Van Rompuy\nPresident of the European Council. - Mr President, honourable Members, dear colleagues, today I report back to you on the first formal meeting of the European Council that I have had the honour to chair.\nAs you know, that meeting had on its agenda our economic strategy for Europe 2020, and our strategy for global negotiations on climate change. That agenda was supplemented by having to deal urgently - for the second time in two months - with the situation in Greece and related questions concerning the eurozone. Allow me to start with the latter point.\nHow, in what circumstances and by whom financial support should be provided, if needed, to the Greek Government, was the subject of much debate in the run-up to the European Council. Indeed, prior to our meeting, there appeared to be a wide divergence of views. This is really not unusual in the history of the Union, certainly when so much is at stake - the key point is that we reached agreement. The Union's capacity to find a compromise remains intact. It is fundamental to our existence.\nIn the event, a large number of bilateral contacts between Member States and myself, the conclusions of the meeting of the eurozone ministers on 15 March, proposals by the Commission on loans by the Member States and intense negotiations between France and Germany helped pave the way to finding a compromise acceptable to all.\nI convened and chaired a meeting of the heads of state and government of the eurozone countries and presented to them a draft statement which, after being amended, was accepted unanimously.\nThe parts of the text for which the European Council is competent were discussed and agreed by the European Council itself. The European Central Bank also agreed.\nIn the statement, we reaffirm that all", "Voting time\nPresident\nThe next item is the vote.\n(For the results and other details on the vote: see minutes.)\nV\u00e9ronique De Keyser\n(FR) Madam President, I wanted to bring it to your attention that my card is not working, because I have just put in a card I thought I had lost in the office and it shows as not valid.

Within the scope of the parliamentary scrutiny, I drew the Commission's attention to an issue which is of great importance for the economy of certain parts of Greece and other regions as well.\nI am referring to the extremely high import duties imposed by South Korea on canned fruit. We know the limits to the role that the European Parliament can play in shaping foreign trade policy. However, the secrecy of the Commission's negotiations should not result in a lack of transparency and democratic accountability, at least within the EU system.\nAndr\u00e1s Gy\u00fcrk\n(HU) Thank you for the floor, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, the Russian elections held on 2 December may fill us with fear. The OSCE and European Council observers, if they were able to obtain visas at all, reported grave abuses. Prior to the election, the government forces did everything they could to make things impossible for the political movements opposing them. Their efforts have denied Russian society the most important pillar of democracy, the freedom of suffrage. We are convinced that, where anti-democratic processes are concerned, Europe cannot bury its head in the sand. Under no circumstances can an emphasis on stability of government justify restricting freedom of expression and suffrage. We cannot forget that the state that applies the policy of force within its borders will not be deterred from applying such a policy in international relations too. We feel that there is no alternative to deeper cooperation between the European Union and Russia. At the same time, the bilateral relationship must in any event be based on maintaining respect for human rights and real reciprocity. Thank you.\nPresident", "2.

There can be no doubt that extremism, by its very nature, is divisive and leads to violence.\nThat is why the first goal, in my view, is a political goal. That will obviously lead me to mention measures which have more to do with security and policing; however, faced with the problem of extremism and its origins, we need once again to promote a European Union which is ever closer to citizens and therefore more able to pass on messages of tolerance, solidarity and respect for the Charter which, as of today, is one of the cornerstones binding on Member States and on citizens.\nI believe that there can never be any justification for extremism; while we have said that many times about terrorism, we also need to say it about racism, for instance, and about xenophobia. However, we also have to explore the deep-seated origins of extremism and violence. We have a duty to do so, because we have a duty to introduce European policy measures that can help not just to counter but ", "Statements by the President\nPresident\nTo begin with, I have several comments and items of information. As you know, Europe has, once again, been struck by a flood disaster. This time, a flood in Romania has already taken the lives of at least 25 people, and thousands of people have been forced to abandon their homes. Four European Union countries have already declared help for Romania in fighting the flood. Floods have also hit the Asturias in northern Spain, causing huge material losses there. In addition, there are reports of unusually heavy rainfall from several other European countries. We are also being told that these record atmospheric phenomena are related to climate change.\nSecondly, I would like to draw your attention to the Bah\u00e1'i religious community in Iran. Last week, 50 homes belonging to members of this community were demolished. There is also a trial under way against 7 Bah\u00e1'is in Iran. We want Iran to comply in full with international standards. In its resolutions and declarations, the European Parliament has repeatedly called for the rights of religious minorities to be respected in Iran. We have also repeatedly condemned use of the death penalty, particularly for minors. We are profoundly disturbed by information which is reaching us that in Iran, which has signed the Convention on the Rights of the Child, there are still people awaiting execution who were minors at the time when they committed the crime of which they are accused.\nThirdly, 13 July is the 10th anniversary of the death of Jan Karski. In 1942, Jan Karski brought the supreme Allied authorities the first report of the extermination of the Jews in occupied Europe. He obtained information by getting inside the ghetto and one of the extermination camps. His was the first report of its kind during the war. After the war, Karski did not return to Europe. As a university professor in the USA, he spoke very favourably of European integration and promoted it on the American continent.\n", "Composition of committees and delegations : see Minutes\nNirj Deva\nMr President, given that the Japanese earthquake and the suffering in Japan have taken second place recently, would it not be appropriate for this Parliament to mark them and to join with the people of Japan, and their democracy, expressing our condolences by observing a minute's silence?\nPresident\nLast week we held a meeting of all Members of the European Parliament with the President of the European Commission and the President of the Council of the European Union, Mr Van Rompuy. At the beginning of that meeting I sent expressions of sympathy to the entire Japanese nation. I spoke, too, of the terrible suffering. We feel deeply for the Japanese people. We also stood to observe a minute's silence in the Chamber to honour the memory of those who died in this catastrophe. There was also a brief discussion on the subject. I think the House has done everything necessary to express our solidarity with the Japanese people. Thank you very much.\n(Applause)\n", "Changes to Schengen (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the changes to the Schengen system (2011/2753 (RSP)).\nMaro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d\nVice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, this is a very important subject, so we have a prepared statement in which we would like clearly to announce that free movement is a defining principle of the European Union. It is one of the most tangible and successful achievements of the European project. An area without internal border controls is central to the success of the Single Market and Europe's continued efforts to boost growth.\nWe must ensure that the reintroduction of internal border controls by Member States does not erode the freedom of movement and impede the realisation of the European Union's greatest achievements. Attacking free movement jeopardises the internal market, solidarity among Europeans and, ultimately, the European project.\nThe European Council agreed that there is a need for an EU-based mechanism to respond to exceptional circumstances which might put at risk the overall functioning of Schengen cooperation. We are studying this idea, but let me be very clear: any such mechanism would need to operate in a way which does not endanger the principle of the free movement of persons.\nBeyond such a mechanism, a series of measures could be envisaged at EU level to assist a Member State facing heavy pressure at the external borders. These would include inspection visits and technical and financial support, including the participation of Frontex. The Commission is looking into how these support measures can be put forward. In the framework of this EU-based mechanism, a safeguard clause could be envisaged as a very last resort, allowing the exceptional reintroduction of internal border controls in a truly critical situation for a strictly limited period, geographically limited, and for a minimal period of time where a Member State fails to fulfil its obligations under Schengen rules.\nThe Eur", "Resumption of session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 11 April 1997.\nMay I remind the house that today is 'World Book Day' , declared last year by UNESCO, and therefore I wish you happy reading.\n\nDecision on urgency\nPresident\nI give the floor to Mrs Malone on a point of order.\n\nMalone\nMr President, I would like to bring to your attention the fact that an Irish Christian Brother was murdered in Kenya in January and this week an Irish priest, very luckily, just escaped with his life. I would ask you to ask President Santer and the Dutch presidency to suspend all EU aid to Kenya until the human rights situation has improved.\n\nPresident\nThank you very much, Mrs Malone. Mr Santer is here and we shall convey your request to the Council for it to take more effective measures to tackle the problem you have brought to our attention.\nI give the floor to Mr von Habsburg on a point of order.\n\nvon Habsburg\nMr President, this is not a point of order, but refers to the agenda. That is what we are discussing and I would like to ask a question about it.\n\nPresident\nMr Habsburg, may I remind you that, as is the custom, our agenda was adopted in Strasbourg.\n\nvon Habsburg\nIn that case I shall not put my question.\n\nPresident\nThank you very much for your cooperation.\n\nvon Wogau\nMr President, on urgency for aid to shipbuilding: this is certainly still a most controversial subject, in the European Community too. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy has discussed this urgency. There were different views on the subject in committee too. But the committee decided by a majority to consider the matter as son as possible, not during this sitting but at the earliest possible next one. And we have taken all the necessary measures to ensure that it can be dealt with as soon and as competently as possible.\nWe have appointed a rapporteur, Mr Glante. We will do all we can to ensure that a reasoned opinion can soon be reache", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nDavid Sumberg\nMadam President, I am very pleased indeed to be able to make a contribution to this debate very briefly because it is important in the times in which we live, when the Third World is suffering greatly from lack of food, to realise that we in the European Union, although facing an economic crisis, are nevertheless extremely wealthy compared with the Third World. Therefore I am very pleased by the fact that we in Parliament are recognising that we have a moral and political duty to those who are in dire danger. We only have to see the pictures sometimes on our television sets to realise that the matter is extremely urgent.\nSo I congratulate Mr Mitchell on this report. It is a welcome development that is worthy of our support and I am very pleased that I was able to give it mine.\nNirj Deva\nMadam President, like Mr Sumberg, I would like to say why we voted for this report. It was quite a difficult decision because we are paying for the transfer with taxpayers' money.\nBut what we are doing is actually feeding a hundred million people, who would otherwise have died by the end of next year. The World Food Programme is feeding 20 to 25 million people who are at risk from malnutrition and death by the end of 2009 if we do not do this. One billion people are now living on one meal every two days. If we spend this money wisely, we will give them one meal every day.\nTwenty-five million people is half the population of my country, the United Kingdom. I do not wish to stand in this Parliament next year and say that I stood aside and watched half the population of my country dying of starvation because we did not do this. I am very pleased indeed that we have voted to put this emergency facility in place.\nDavid Sumberg\nMadam President, the Garc\u00eda-Margallo report is a report which I can approve because we are all engaged in trying to prevent tax evasion, which is important, and particularly tax evasion in relation to VAT.", "Decision on urgent procedure\nPervenche Ber\u00e8s\nMadam President, this discussion will take place this evening, if the plenary votes in favour of the urgent procedure on this issue. This is an amendment to European legislation that enables us to grant facilities for balances of payments, for countries outside the euro zone.\nAs we are all aware, the issue at hand is that of Hungary but, unfortunately, I believe that we must look ahead and therefore enhance this facility of the European Union to provide assistance to its Member States, including those that lie outside the euro zone.\nI would therefore ask the plenary assembly to kindly vote in favour of this urgent procedure.\n", "Draft amending budget No 7/2010: guarantee provided by the European Union in accordance with the provisions of Article 122 of the TFEU - financial assistance to Member States (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Surj\u00e1n, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the Council's position on Draft amending budget No 7/2010 of the European Union for the financial year 2010, Section III - Commission (13476/2010 - C7-0261/2010 -.\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Surj\u00e1n\nHonourable Council representatives, Commissioner Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission proposed and the Council adopted the seventh amendment to the 2010 budget. What is the essence of this amendment?\nWell, if we wanted to joke around, this would be a good topic. We have created a blank line, a new line in the budget, into which we will not put a single cent, let alone billions. At the same time, journalists revel in reporting that this involves EUR 60 billion. This EUR 60 billion, as the caption indicates, is none other than a guarantee, and the Commission believes that the chance of it being called in, of having to actually pay it up, is zero.\nWell, the worst case scenario is not always to our liking, but the main point is that there is very little likelihood of having to move actual sums of money through this row. So why have it at all? And why as early as now, in the 2010 budget? Because what we are talking about is, in fact, part of the plan designed by the European Union to resolve the financial crisis of countries getting into difficulties in the future.\nThis is the item that refers primarily to the Parliament and the European Union's budget, and has an upper limit which cannot exceed EUR 60 billion for the period ending in 2014. This 60 billion is a fixed upper limit. Why must we do this now? We must do it because this is a message. A message to the market. A message to those who doubt that we want to rescue countries which may get into difficulties in the future. At the moment, there is no nee", "A facility providing financial assistance for Member States' balances of payments - Financial support to Member States (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate:\non the report by Mrs Ber\u00e8s, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 332/2002 establishing a facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States' balances of payments - C6-0389/2008 -;\nthe Commission statement on financial support to Member States.\nPervenche Ber\u00e8s\nrapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, behind this obscure title, each person is assessing the importance of the discussion we are holding this evening following Hungary's request for financing, which was first made to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The European Union has looked at the issue to verify the conditions under which it could give its support to one of the Member States.\nIt is true that there was a discussion amongst the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs as to why Hungary first approached the IMF. That is a question for Hungary as a country, as a member of the European Union of some years standing, and also for the institutions of the European Union in the sense that, manifestly, at this stage, we have been unable sufficiently to develop this climate of confidence, this climate of solidarity, this climate of cooperation to allow a country like Hungary, in its current difficult situation, to consider that its first circle of solidarity, its first circle of cooperation, should be the European Union.\nI believe, finally, that the plan implemented for a balance of payments assistance facility, on the basis of Article 119, achieved on the initiative of the Commission and Mr Almunia, whom I thank, will allow an appropriate solution to be found jointly with the IMF.\nEvidently, we all think now that, unfortunately, Hungary's situation is not an isolated case, and we must in some way consolidate the cush", "MEDIA Mundus: audiovisual cooperation programme with professionals from third countries (debate) \nPresident\nThe first item is the report by Mrs Hieronymi, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing an audiovisual cooperation programme with professionals from third countries MEDIA Mundus - C6-0011/2009 -.\nRuth Hieronymi\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me particular pleasure that we have succeeded in drawing up and adopting a new support programme for European films for the culture and economy of the European Union and worldwide within a short space of time - just six months - and before the end of this legislative period.\nThis was only possible because there has been exceptionally good cooperation, for which I would like to express my warmest thanks. Thank you very much, Commissioner. The Commission's proposal on the establishment of the MEDIA Mundus programme was an excellent one. There was excellent cooperation with the Czech Presidency and cooperation in the Committee on Culture and Education was best of all. Only as a result of this was it possible to achieve this goal in such a short time.\nThe promotion of European films through the MEDIA programme has been very successful in the European Union for some 15 years. Ninety per cent of all European films shown outside their country of origin are promoted by the MEDIA programme. So far, however, the programme has only promoted projects within Europe, and this promotion programme is no longer adequate at a time of globalisation of the markets and new technologies.\nThere are new opportunities, but also new challenges. The MEDIA Mundus programme we are discussing today is a fantastic response. It is a response to the opportunities offered to the European film industry by new markets outside Europe. It is also a response to the need and the opportunities to use the promotion of films and films th", "\n\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is the debate on the report by Mr\u00a0Kreissl-D\u00f6rfler on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the amended proposal for a Council directive on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status (14203/2004 \u2013 C6-0200/2004 \u2013 2000/0238(CNS)) (A6-0222/2005). \nFranco Frattini,\n\u00a0\u00a0 Mr\u00a0President, ladies and gentlemen, you all know the position: the directive on asylum procedures has been the subject of negotiations in the Council for over four years; the outcome therefore reflects a fragile compromise among the Member States of the Union.\nI have to be frank and say that it is a compromise that certainly does not rise to great heights of ambition. I am well aware of the concerns expressed in the report, and in part I share them. I therefore thank the rapporteur for the work he has done, even though the difficulties that we have encountered and the fact that the directive still does not aim very high are further good reasons \u2013 and I really mean no paradox in this \u2013 for Parliament to approve the report today and to make this complex procedure continue until the directive enters into force.\nIn my view, there are, first of all, excellent methodological reasons for adopting the report. Indeed, if the directive enters into force, any subsequent proposal on this topic will have to go through the system of qualified majority voting, not unanimity any more, and it will have to go through the codecision procedure involving the Council and Parliament. That means that, once the first stage is over with the approval of this directive, we shall have the prospect of Parliament having a codecision vote in the subsequent stages, which I consider to be about the substance. I am hopeful that we will achieve this result as soon as possible, just as soon as we approve the directive.\nThen there are reasons regarding future prospects. Shifting the procedure from unanimity to qualified majority an", "Announcement by the President\nPresident\nFirst of all, I would like to tell you about the difficult situation in Poland. In view of the dramatic flooding in Poland, where a significant amount of the country is flooded and people have lost all their possessions, I would like, on behalf of the European Parliament and all of us, to convey expressions of support and solidarity with the Poles and most sincere expressions of sympathy with those who are suffering, today.\n(Applause)\nThere will be a debate on this at the next part-session of the European Parliament, on 16 June 2010. I am sure the European Union will show solidarity and respond positively to the request from the Polish authorities for financial support. We have our own European Union Solidarity Fund, which is so important in this kind of natural disaster.\n", "6. The exclusion of health services from the Services Directive (vote) \n- Report: Vergnaud\n- Before the vote:\nBernadette Vergnaud \nrapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I am taking the floor simply to point out to the House that there has been an error.\nIndeed, as the same sentence appears in three different paragraphs, Parliament's services have rightly deleted paragraphs 47 and 53 from the report, since this sentence appears in its entirety in paragraph 51.\nI simply wished to inform my fellow Members of this matter.\n", "Community Customs Code (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the Common Position adopted by the Council on 15 October 2007 with a view to the adoption of a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the Community Customs Code (Modernized Customs Code) (11272/6/2007 - C6-0354/2007 - (Rapporteur: Janelly Fourtou).\nJanelly Fourtou\nrapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, now that we have come to the end of three years of hard work I am delighted at what has been achieved in respect of the key points in this document.\nThe customs union is one of the pillars of the European Union and an essential element in the functioning of the internal market. The present Community Customs Code, which was drawn up in the 1980s and adopted in the 1990s, is now outdated. Our customs services are faced with new challenges. In 2007 world trade totalled nearly 16 billion dollars, or 31% of global GDP, and the European Union alone accounted for 20% of the total volume of global imports and exports.\nThe customs services are therefore responsible for maintaining the smooth flow of trade and the controls that are needed to provide for this, while at the same time ensuring that the safety and security of EU citizens is protected. If a satisfactory balance is to be reached the control methods used have to be modernised and the level of cooperation strengthened between the different services and economic operators.\nThe Code also has to be adapted to other radical changes that have occurred in the international commercial environment, mainly resulting from the growing and irreversible recourse to IT and electronic data exchange technologies. This particular subject was also the focus of a report that was drawn up by my colleague Mr Heaton-Harris and adopted by Parliament last December.\nThe first reading of the modernised customs c", "1. Guinea Bissau\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution on the situation in Guinea Bissau.\nJos\u00e9 Ribeiro e Castro\nMadam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, once again, sadly, we are discussing in this House the situation of Guinea-Bissau, which is a truly painful situation. It is a country that has known chronic instability for many years and that tried to take the road towards democracy at the beginning of the 1990s. Nothing went right, there was a coup d'\u00e9tat and a minor civil war, and it has since been in a situation of major political and military instability, tensions and deep rivalries. Recently there has also been a very worrying presence of drug trafficking interests, which have become increasingly evident to all observers.\nWe strongly condemn the recent attacks: the bomb attack that killed the Chief of Staff, General Tagme Na Waie, and also the particularly barbaric, if not savage, assassination of President Nino Vieira. Regardless of their past, we express our solidarity with their families and with the people of Guinea-Bissau and we regret and strongly condemn these attacks.\nWe want to see a return to normality. The lesson that I have learnt and that I wanted to stress in this resolution was that impunity is not an answer. In the past, with regard to the assassination of Ansumane Man\u00e9 and General Ver\u00edssimo Seabra, how could we have closed our eyes to the fact that the perpetrators were not found and brought to justice? It is clear that this is not the answer. We must therefore impress upon the government of Guinea-Bissau that those responsible must be found. The guilty parties must be brought to justice and we have to provide all the assistance that is needed.\nFinally, I also want to draw attention to our concern at the presence of drug trafficking throughout the region, the risk that this also poses to the European Union and its shocking presence, which is clearly evident, in Guinea-Bissau. I also want to call for", "6. Financial year 2009 as amended by the Council (vote) \n- After the vote:\n\u00c9ric Woerth\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, your vote on the second reading of the draft budget constitutes the final stage of a procedure marked by a very high standard of cooperation between the two branches of the budgetary authority and with the Commission. I should like to extend my warmest thanks to all those involved, especially the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr B\u00f6ge, the rapporteurs, Mrs Haug and Mr Lewandowski, and Commissioner Grybauskait\u0117.\nAt our consultation meeting of 21 November we worked together to develop a balanced budget for 2009 that will guarantee that the funding of EU policies is properly assessed at the same time as European taxpayers' interests are protected. Together, we have come up with methods of funding the food facility, thereby fulfilling our duty to support developing countries and, together, we have designed practical measures making it possible to break the deadlock on cohesion policy and to finally launch the programmes for the period 2007-2013.\nThe importance of this initiative was stressed by the Heads of State or Government at the European Council, and this represents a major strand of the European response to the economic crisis, which we need to continue to work on without delay. Your vote will ensure that the results of the consultation are realised in full and, in accordance with the procedure laid down by the treaty, I can therefore confirm that the Council accepts the maximum rate of increase resulting from your second reading.\nPresident\nThank you for your statement, Mr Woerth.\nAs the Commission does not wish to comment, I note that the budgetary procedure went ahead in accordance with the Treaty and the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006, and that, pursuant to Article 13 of that Agreement, the Council and Parliament have established that they agree on the maximum rate of increase f", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of Thursday, 19 February 1998 have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nHallam\nMr President, having spent the previous twenty-four hours agonizing over how I should vote on Iraq, I was rather concerned to see that my vote was wrongly recorded on Amendment No 12. In fact I had voted against Amendment No 12 rather than for it. Can that be corrected please?\n\nR\u00fcbig\nMr President, it is indeed true, as Mr Habsburg-Lothringen and Mr Posselt said yesterday, that there has been no debate on crime in Brussels, but I would nevertheless like to draw Members' attention to the fact that President GilRobles Gil-Delgado said in his letter to us: \"Please rest assured that I share your concern and I shall press the Belgian authorities for a satisfactory solution, as far as the safety of Members and staff of the European Parliament is concerned' .\n\nKerr\nMr President, you will note from yesterday's Minutes that I asked the President-in-Office to rule whether Mr Titley's personal attack on me casting aspersions on my mental health was a crime against the rules of the House and I ask you to rule on that point. You may share his opinion but, of course, I trust that you, as a good guardian of the rules of the House, can say whether under Rule 108 I am entitled to make a personal statement on that response.\n\nPresident\nMr Kerr, it is a matter of interpretation whether Mr Titley questioned your mental health. From reading the contribution it is not clear that was the intention of his remarks.\n\nMacartney\nMr President, in the Minutes it says that I asked for confirmation that Parliament would be able to give its views when the instructions were modified. I think there has been a lot of editing, because what I said was that the changes in the rules - because I believe that is what they are - should be brought to this House for confirmation before they took effect. That is a very important correction.\n\nTitley\nMr President, in relation to Mr Kerr", "Preparation of the European Council (18-19 June 2009) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statements of the Council and of the Commission on the preparation of the European Council on 18 and 19 June.\nAlexandr Vondra\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I very much welcome this opportunity to appear before you well in advance of the next meeting of the European Council, which I will not personally attend. Of course, this time the circumstances are a bit unusual, as a new Czech Government is about to be appointed. I will say a few more words about this at the very end of my statement.\nLet me first run through the main issues on the agenda of the June European Council as we the Presidency are preparing it. I shall start with the institutional issues. In December 2008, the European Council agreed on a path designed to enable the Lisbon Treaty to enter into force by the end of 2009. In essence, this involves giving legal guarantees and assurances on a number of issues of concern to the Irish people, in return for which the Irish Government is committed to seeking ratification of the Treaty before the end of October.\nWork on implementing this agreement is still ongoing, and I am not at this stage in a condition to go into details. I am confident that the forthcoming European Council will be able to fulfil its side of the bargain.\nAs you all probably know, tomorrow there will be a vote on the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty in the Czech Senate. I am going home in the middle of the night to be there from early morning. I believe that the result of this vote will send a positive message to the other Member States and that it will calm down some unfounded apprehensions. I am working hard! Nevertheless, the Czech senators must in any case be granted unconditional independence in this democratic decision-making. It is obvious that any attempt to put pressure on them might prove counterproductive.\nLast December, it was also agreed that the process of appoin", "European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission, by Giles Chichester and Angelika Niebler, on the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA), on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats - B6-0159/2008).\nAngelika Niebler\nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in 2004 the European Network and Information Security Agency, known by the acronym ENISA, was founded. Its task is essentially to improve network and information security in the European Union and to promote closer cooperation among the Member States.\nENISA's mandate is unquestionably complex. Computer viruses, spam mail, phishing and Trojans are real threats in a world of virtual data. Hacking threatens private and public networks. The damage done to our modern communication society is immense. Security is the Achilles' heel of our computer systems. This is where we are vulnerable and endangered; when I put it that way, you will understand how important this agency is to us.\nOn the other hand, this agency does not have a large staff, but it still has this mammoth task to perform. This raises the legitimate question whether ENISA can actually perform its tasks in the way in which it currently operates. We have very often discussed, both in the chamber and in other bodies here, how ENISA might perhaps be further developed. The latest proposal from the Commission was that ENISA be merged with the planned European Authority for Telecommunications Markets. That proposal was not embraced by Parliament or by the Council. Instead, Parliament and the Council decided before the summer recess that ENISA's mandate should be extended for three years.\nThe ultimate purpose of our question to the Commission is to ensure that this debate is structured over the next three years. By asking the question, we also want to grasp the nettle an", "Question Hour with the President of the Commission\nPresident\nThe next item is the Question Hour with the President of the Commission.\nManfred Weber\nMr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, in its session today, the Commission approved the new SWIFT agreement, and did so by a large majority or even unanimously.\nI would like to ask the President of the Commission - since I am sure he is aware that many of our citizens are concerned about data being passed on - where he sees substantial progress and how we can convince our citizens of the necessity of this agreement.\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso\nPresident of the Commission. - It is true that the revised draft agreement was today adopted unanimously by the Commission. We believe it is subject to strict compliance with safeguards on privacy and the protection of personal data. It ensures the principle of necessity and proportionality and its purpose is strictly limited to the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of terrorism and terrorist financing.\nThe agreement, as it stands now, respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The agreement secures significant safeguards for the data when processed by the provider. It provides also for transparency of the use of data and the availability of a process for seeking judicial redress.\nThe Commission therefore considers that this draft is compatible with respect for fundamental rights and will give appropriate answers to Parliament concerns, as expressed when the resolution on the interim fifth agreement was voted in March 2010.\nManfred Weber\nMr President, I just have a brief supplementary question. It concerns the content of the agreement that you have presented. I would like to repeat my previous question. What are the implications of this agreement for transatlantic relations? How important is it for the other topics that we need to discuss with the US? If you could give us an idea of this", "2.

In addition, I would like to point out that versions of the new text are not yet available in all languages, as laid down in the Rules of Procedure.\nMr President, we would like to know why the services have accepted such an amendment without, I might add, obtaining the agreement of the political groups, and did not make use of an oral amendment, as provided for by established practice and the Rules of Procedure.\nIn accordance with the Rules of Procedure, it is not possible to vote on an amendment to the text that was tabled outside of the permitted time and without having consulted the political groups.\nPresident\nThe Secretariat informs me that a text is available for the honourable Members in all languages.

Symbolically, 45 MEPs demonstrated this support by collectively sponsoring the 45 Palestinian Members of Parliament. As elected representatives, we cannot but condemn the imprisonment of the President and of one third of the Members of the Palestinian Legislative Council. We ask for their immediate and unconditional release. We continue to appeal for a European Parliament delegation to be sent and for all the necessary steps to be taken in order to achieve this aim.\n(Applause)\nPresident\nI must inform the honourable Member that last Wednesday - a week ago today - I made a similar request to the Knesset. Making such a request before the Knesset is something that takes a great deal of prior thought.

Movement is needed on all sides.\nJavier Solana\nHigh Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by saying that exactly a week ago, the Quartet was meeting in Berlin. Since I am sure that you will have read the document that was made public that same evening, you may be aware of our solidarity with the Members of the Palestinian Authority, of the Parliament, who have been detained and, as the President of this Parliament has quite rightly said, with the other people who have been detained against their will in Israeli or Palestinian territories.\nMr President, I would like to make a brief statement. I have been asked to speak for no longer than 10 or 15 minutes - I shall try to do so ", "Order of business\nPresident\nThe final version of the draft agenda for the present part-session as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 7 December 2006 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.\nWe shall examine the amendments proposed.\nTuesday:\nPhilip Bushill-Matthews\nMr President, there is a slight mistake in Tuesday's agenda regarding Commission Question Time. According to the English version, Question Time starts at 6 p.m. and goes on until 7.30; in the French version, it starts at 6.30 and goes on until 7.30. So either our French colleagues are being deprived of half an hour of questions, which is not very fair on them, or the French agenda is correct and we are all being deprived of half an hour of questions, which is not very fair on us. Perhaps you could explain.\nPresident\nWithout wishing to set a precedent, I must tell you that the French version is the correct version.\nBernd Posselt\n(DE) Mr President, I am not surprised by your claim that this is not a precedent. I have looked into this. The reality is that, of all Question Times this year, 75% were cut short or deferred, yet we are told, again and again, that this is exceptional.\nPresident\nNo, when I said a precedent I was talking about our taking the French version as the correct version. That was what I meant when I said, 'without wishing to set a precedent'.\n- Thursday:\nWith regard to the debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats proposes that the item 'Release of health workers imprisoned in Libya' be replaced with the item 'Myanmar'.\nDoes that group wish to explain its proposal?\nIt would appear not.\nMr Swoboda, do you wish to speak for or against?\nHannes Swoboda\n(DE) Mr President, that is a very difficult question.

It is nice for you to congratulate us for being here today. Although it is difficult, it is our job. It is nothing special. I would simply like to recommend for next time that you make this job a little easier for us by providing us with information more quickly and by answering our emails so that we know what is likely to happen. Those who are not here today may then perhaps also come.\n(Applause)\nPresident\nI must admit that I do not fully understand your remark, Mr Leichtfried, because the Members have reacted very well. However, let us leave this discussion.\nJohn Bufton\nMr President, I would like to concur with the gentleman over there. We know there is an issue regarding air travel - of course we do; we are not silly - but I cannot understand why it has taken until tonight to come to this conclusion. We have all arrived here today, there are many people in the Chamber, and there are many staff. The costs to the taxpayer run into millions of pounds for us all to be here, and yet you decide to cancel it at a moment's notice. I think it is absolutely abysmal that you have done that.\nI think there are enough people here to vote. We know the difficult conditions, but this is supposed to be a parliament. You have turned round now and said we are not going to vote, but you can come along and discuss things, debate things, which quite often means absolutely nothing, and then, when it comes to voting, we are told we cannot.\nI think the taxpayer back in the UK will be absolutely appalled by this. We have trouble in the UK with finances, we are cutting services, we have a general election, w", "Resumption of the session\nPresident.\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 13 June 2002.\n\nPresident.\nWe now move to the order of business.\nThursday:\nI have received a request from the PPE-DE Group and the PSE Group to replace Item 4 under Topical and Urgent Debate \"Democracy in Afghanistan\" with a new item: \"The crisis in Argentina\".\n\nWurtz (GUE/NGL).\nI would like to make a proposal: since we currently only have four items on the agenda for the topical and urgent debate and since the Rules of Procedure and common practice allow us to have five, I would suggest that we add the item on Argentina rather than replace it with another item.\n\nvan den Berg (PSE).\nMr President, my group, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, would like to discuss Afghanistan and Cuba in September, provided that both points are well prepared in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy. We have a feeling that neither of these topics should be dealt with by singling out one item, but rather that this should be done thoroughly. Both topics can then be put on the agenda in September. This applies to both Cuba and Afghanistan. We therefore support the idea of replacing Afghanistan by Argentina.\n\nPresident.\nIt is proposed as a replacement, as before.\n\nCohn-Bendit (Verts/ALE).\nMr President, I would just like to say that our group fully supports Mr Wurtz's proposal and wishes to add Argentina to the topical and urgent debate. We must, of course, discuss Argentina since it is an urgent subject and urgent subjects do not always take the form of a speech. Events have occurred that I, for example, do not see in the same way as Mr Wurtz. Events have taken place, complaints have been made about what has happened in Afghanistan, and it is Parliament's role to discuss these and to try to clarify the situation. I therefore feel that it is absolutely necessary to open up the debate on both Argentina and Afghanistan as soon as ", "Order of business\nPresident\nThe final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 10 January 2008, pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed.

Furthermore, the Slovenian Presidency has asked, for procedural and official reasons, for the meeting to be postponed until the next plenary part-session in Belgium. There is no objection to this postponement.\n(Parliament adopted the motion.)\nWednesday:\nPresident\nThe Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe moved that the debate on the statements of the Council and Commission on the situation in Pakistan following the assassination of Benazir Bhutto be concluded with the submission of motions for a resolution.\nGraham Watson\nMr President, we have over the holiday break seen a number of very worrying developments in Pakistan, not least, of course, the assassination of Benazir Bhutto.\nWe have the opportunity to discuss this matter this week. It is the view of my group that we should close our debate with a resolution, in particular since we should take a position sending a message to the Pakistani authorities in advance of the visit of Mr Musharaff to the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House.\nPresident\nDoes anyone else wish to speak in support of the motion?\nDaniel Cohn-Bendit\n(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that it is very poor practice indeed for important debates to be concluded without a resolution.

These cases of parliamentary immunity are extremely important because they may have a bearing on the freedom of exercise of a Member who is exposed to the political hostility of the government, or to the political hostility of the courts, or to the political hostility of the courts as exploited by the government, via prosecutors.\nI note that these issues have disappeared from the debate and I find that deeply regrettable. There remains only one vote without debate on a report by Mrs Wallis, concerning the immunity of Mr Siwiec. This vote without debate does not permit speeches and thus does not permit the Member concerned to express himself before his peers, before his fellow Members. I find that deeply regrettable.\nI will conclude by saying a word about the report by our fellow Member, Mr Speroni, which was adopted by a very large majority - by virtually the whole of this Parliament, I believe - on the attitude of the French authorities, who denied our former fellow Member, Mr Marchiani, the protection of his immunity with regard to phone-tapping, when such immunity is guaranteed to members of national parliaments.\nI would like to know what has become of the recommendations from Mr Speroni's report and, in particular, of the complaint that we had to lodge with the Court of Justice of the European Communities.\nPresident\nThere has not been a request for a debate to be held on parliamentary immunity. Therefore, voting will be held on this matter tomorrow.

This is in light of the fact that what we decided in November has already enabled support to be given to Hungary, to Latvia and, yesterday, to Romania.\nWe feel that this is necessary, and we have held a debate among ourselves, which I will not hide from you, to learn whether this assessment of countries outside the euro zone should be done exclusively on a case-by-case basis, or whether, in reality, there", "Commission Reports on Competition Policy 2006 and 2007 (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is a brief presentation of the report by Jonathan Evans, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the reports on competition policy 2006 and 2007.\nJonathan Evans\nrapporteur. - Mr President, the European Commission produces its annual competition report and it is traditional for the European Parliament to cast its eye over the report and to produce an own-initiative reaction to it.\nIn this case, because of timing factors, the reports for 2006 and 2007 have been brought together but - taking up one of the points mentioned by Commissioner Barrot a little earlier - it is the case that the context of our consideration of these reports has changed rather markedly, since we in fact began the exercise of considering the report some time ago. At that time, we were focused on the whole business of the modernisation of competition policy, the significant amount of work taken forward by former Commissioner, Mario Monti, and by the current Commissioner, Neelie Kroes, and on looking at the impact of that in terms of the Commission's ability to deal with the abuse of market power and to deal more effectively with mergers and state aid. By and large, that has been a very good story in these reports and this is very clear from the reaction that we have from Parliament's own report. We have seen record activity on the part of the Commission in terms of dealing with hardcore cartels, we have seen the development of the leniency system, we have seen record fines put into operation by the Commission and we have seen record activity in terms of mergers and state aid notifications as well.\nThis is a process that is gathering pace in terms of modernisation because the Commission is currently bringing forward proposals, in a White Paper, on introducing private damages. That is something, similarly, that our committee and Parliament have been supportive of.\nOur committe", "Welcome\nPresident\nI have some special information for you.

I wish to say a few words.\nMr Angelo Vassallo, aged 57, mayor of Pollica in the Campania region of Italy, was murdered last Sunday night by the Camorra on his way home. He was better known as the 'environmental mayor' for his great work to improve the natural environment in his region.\nMr Vassallo always fought against the infiltration of organised crime in his municipality. He had a fantastic human touch in his relations with his citizens. We must not underestimate the role of organised crime in some of our Member States. We should stand together in solidarity to root this evil out of our societies, so that Angelo Vassallo's death will not have been in vain.\nI would ask you to stand for one minute's silence in his memory.\n", "Opening of the sitting\n(The sitting was opened at 9.05 a.m.)\n\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, I hope you will excuse the fact that I am a few minutes late. Our former fellow Member Otto von Habsburg is celebrating his 96th birthday today. He was a Member of the European Parliament from 1979 to 1999. His attendance record and the quality of his work was an example to us all. I have just spoken to him on the telephone, which is why I am a couple of minutes late, and have congratulated him warmly on behalf of all you - I hope I am allowed to do this - and, of course, on behalf of his political friends from Bavaria on reaching his 96th birthday.\n", "Kyrgyzstan (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on Kyrgyzstan.\nCatherine Ashton\nHigh Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to make a statement on Kyrgyzstan. As this House knows very well, the situation on the ground remains somewhat fluid and tense. Kyrgyzstan has attracted quite some media and political attention, and I have followed developments closely from the beginning, making two statements, one on 7 April and the other on 8 April.\nI sent a delegation almost immediately, headed by the EU Special Representative, Pierre Morel, to the country and we stayed in close contact throughout his visit.\nThe coordinated EU-UN-OSCE effort that started last week in Bishkek continues at the moment and will continue until the crisis and its consequences are overcome. Yesterday, I spoke with the Kazakh Foreign Minister Saudabayev, who today is visiting Bishkek as Chair-in-Office of the OSCE, and who has literally just sent me a message to say that he has completed his tasks.\nThe resignation of the President, on the basis of Article 50 of the present Kyrgyz Constitution, and his departure from the country is expected to reduce political tension. However, that is not the end of the crisis, and we have important work to do.\nMost importantly, we have to ensure stability and public order, and while the situation has generally calmed down, violence continues. Reports told us yesterday that as many as five people were killed in riots in the suburbs of Bishkek. All sides need to be careful and avoid provocation. The restoration of law and order must be a priority. Citizens and businesses in Kyrgyzstan need to be able to go about their daily life without fear for their lives or for their physical integrity.\nThe second issue concerns the legi", "An EU Strategy for Central Asia (debate) \nPresident\n(DE) The next item is the report by Cem \u00d6zdemir, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on an EU Strategy for Central Asia.\nCem \u00d6zdemir\nrapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first let me take this opportunity to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their support and valuable suggestions for the report on Central Asia. I would also like to take this opportunity, however, specifically to thank the AFET secretariat and of course also Group colleagues, who should not be forgotten at this point and without whom this report could not have come into being. Let me mention just a few of them: Dag Sourander, Paolo Bergamaschi, Rosemary Opacic, Andrew Woodcock, Margaret Fran\u00e7ois and my colleague Rana Ayd\u0131n.\nWe in the European Parliament are discussing the report on Central Asia for the first time this evening. I think this is a special moment for Parliament because it reflects the importance we attach to the Central Asian region in our relations. Central Asia is becoming an increasingly important strategic partner for the European Union. After years of neglect the European Union has recognised the need for a coherent strategy towards the five Central Asian republics of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the five republics became members of the OSCE, which means indeed that they have also undertaken to accept the values, standards and principles we share within the OSCE.\nUnder the German Presidency of the Council, on 20/21 June 2007 the European Council adopted a common strategy for Central Asia. That strategy offers the five republics a share in Europe's experience and expertise in key areas, such as good governance, the rule of law, democratisation, human rights and education and training.

Alternative investment fund managers (\nJean-Paul Gauz\u00e8s\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, the vote that you are going to cast concerns one of the key elements of Europe's response to the financial crisis, namely, the regulation of alternative investment funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds.\nThis compromise document, this compromise text, has been long in the making. We have succeeded in reaching a broad agreement, and I should like to pay tribute here, before the ECOFIN President, to the Belgian Presidency, which has been directly and significantly involved in this matter, in particular, through the Minister's active participation in key trialogues, and I should also like to thank Commissioner Barnier, whose work has been particularly useful.\nLastly, I should also like to thank my fellow shadow rapporteurs, the Secretariat staff and the experts who assisted us. This work took more than 14 months, and there were 1 690 amendments. It was a lot of work, but I believe that today, we have come up with a text that, thanks to the Belgian Presidency, marks a significant step forward in the field of European financial regulation.\n", "Welcome\nPresident\nBefore moving on to the first item on the agenda, I would like to welcome a delegation from the Pan African Parliament, led by Her Excellency Mrs Getrude Mongella, President of the Pan-African Parliament, which is seated in the public gallery.\n(Applause)\nWelcome, Madam President. Your delegation will take part in an exchange of views today with our Committee on Development and with the Delegation for relations with the Pan-African Parliament. You will also have meetings with representatives of the European Parliament's different services in order to help you to develop your Parliament's administrative structure and strengthen the relations between our two institutions. I wish you a happy and fruitful stay in Brussels.\n", "A new Energy Strategy for Europe 2011 - 2020 (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Kolarska-Bobi\u0144ska, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on 'Towards a new Energy Strategy for Europe 2011-2020'.\nLena Kolarska-Bobi\u0144ska\nMr President, Commissioner, recently, we have talked a lot about the institutional changes which have resulted from the Treaty of Lisbon. These include the External Action Service and the procedures for work on the budget, but the Treaty of Lisbon also has reference to Union policies. Today, we are debating the first post-Lisbon energy strategy, which the Commission has prepared for the years 2011-2020.\nIt should be emphasised that both the Commission's strategy and Parliament's report reflect the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon - what it says about energy solidarity and its concern for energy security and supply. The Commission's strategy and Parliament's report also lay emphasis on strengthening energy policy and making it more European in character. We can achieve this by undertaking certain measures.\nFirstly, we must speedily implement current European energy legislation in the Member States. Therefore, we fully support the Commission in adopting tough measures against governments and businesses which neglect to take action in this area. Secondly, for our common objectives to be achieved, the common energy market has to work well. This also concerns the need to build a renewable energy market in Europe. In order to achieve our objectives, it is essential, therefore, to extend and modernise the European and cross-border energy infrastructure. This is often opposed by monopolies and the governments which protect them. However, without a Europe-wide network, key objectives of the European Union will not be achieved.\nThere are two main obstacles to be overcome, here: administration and finance. On questions of administration, we need above all to establish clear priorities and rules for the selection of key proj", "4.

Mr\u00a0Barroso said that he had been surprised to hear certain members of a parliamentary group voice sharp criticism of a Commissioner, in this case the Commissioner for competition, when the same group had called strongly for the Commissioner in question to remain in that post. During these comments it was obvious that it was me he had in mind, as he even turned to face us while speaking.\nI should like to note that Mr\u00a0Watson has formally denied having said anything of the kind. He simply pointed out that the letter signed by Mrs\u00a0Ber\u00e8s had been intended to show that the committee in question and members of this committee who belonged to the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe approved the appointment of Mrs\u00a0Kroes. I believe that this is a crucial issue, as what right does the President of the Commission have to challenge not the substance of a Member\u2019s arguments, but his rights and legitimacy? He has spoken of the unique relations that exist between Parliament and the Commission Presidency. What gives him the right to restrict a Member\u2019s freedom of action?\nIs Mr\u00a0Barroso in charge of inter-group discipline? Is it to be the case, merely because he has held conversations, and conversations he has interpreted wrongly, that the freedom of action of each Member of this House is to be restricted? This is unacceptable, and I should like to ask that Mr Barroso provide a clear explanation of his statements before the vote at noon. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Mr Bourlanges, I note your personal statement, which will be followed up in the appropriate manner, in accordance with our Rules of Procedure.", "Resumption of the session\nPresident.\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 4 July 2002.\nI should like to take the opportunity to welcome everyone back for the autumn session of our work. I am sure that you are now relaxed and ready to do battle on the various public policy issues ahead of us.\n\nPresident.\nIn recent weeks in Central Europe, particularly in upper and lower Austria, eastern Germany and parts of the Czech Republic, entire areas have been ravaged by floods of unprecedented and catastrophic proportions. More than 100 people have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been forced out of their homes and out of their work places. Today, on behalf of myself and this House I want to express our deepest sympathy with the victims of the floods and their families, and to recognise the extraordinary efforts of the rescue services and so many volunteers. Tomorrow, in a specially convened emergency debate, in addition to our heartfelt sympathy of this afternoon we have the possibility, in a practical way, to lay the foundations to show real solidarity. As a mark of respect for those who died, I ask you to rise in a minute's silence.\n(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)\nOn Sunday, 4 August, Cecilio Gallego Alaria and a six-year-old girl were killed by a car bomb which had been placed near a bus stop in the Spanish town of Santa Pola in Alicante. On 1 August David Caldwell was killed in an explosion in Derry in Northern Ireland. By these acts, terrorists have shown once more in their denial to the right to life their essential provocation to the democratic order. Terrorism denies the common values and principles that the European Union is founded upon, represents, promotes and defends. Our Union is based on the principles of democracy and the rule of law which are common to the Member States and therefore can offer no justification for the use of terrorist violence.\nOn my own behalf and that of the House, I str", "1. Recent repression of demonstrations in Russia\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on recent repression of demonstrations in Russia.\nDanutBudreikait\nauthor. - (LT) As it goes about its activities and in its dealings with other countries, the European Union acts in accordance with its fundamental values, the most important of which are democracy and human rights and freedoms.\nWhen addressing the European Parliament, Russian Duma delegates state they profess the same values as the European Union. However, Russia is not about to listen to anyone's advice on how to deal with domestic matters.\nThe brutality against peaceful demonstrations by residents in Moscow, Saint Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod expose the Russian Government's intolerance and fear of independent thinkers, especially as the presidential elections of 2008 approach.\nAs soon as Russia experienced the political and economic power of its energy supply 'weapon', it ceased to pay any attention to international public opinion and the signals it sends about breaches of human rights in the country. Russia is a strategic partner of the European Union, and for the sake of energy policy we apply a double standard: one for Russia and another for the rest of the world.\nAs we negotiate a new treaty of cooperation between the European Union and Russia, I invite the Council to take a look at events in Russia and not to make any concessions to it.\nMicha\u0142 Tomasz Kami\u0144ski \nauthor. - (PL) Madam President, it is a good thing that we have managed, in this House, to draw up a compromise version of the resolution on human rights infringements in Russia, as it is important for the European Parliament to have a united position and to address both Russian society and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, with one voice. In the sad days following the loss of the first democratic Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, it is especially important for all those who have been rooting for democracy in Russi", "23. Opening of international negotiations in view of adopting an international treaty for the protection of the Arctic (vote) \n- Before the vote:\nAvril Doyle\nMr President, I rise to ask colleagues to consider the referral of this motion for a resolution back to committee. I do so on foot of what Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner said here last night in the debate. I do not do so lightly, because I share the concerns of all colleagues who have spoken in this debate and as expressed in this resolution.\nBut I would like to say, to be fair to the Commissioner, that it is not our intent to cause her any problems at a critical stage in the negotiations she is having at the moment with the Arctic Council. She has specifically stated that 'such a proposal would at this stage' - and I am quoting from the transcript of what she said in plenary - 'not only be ineffective, but could prove to be detrimental to the EU's role and credibility in overall Arctic cooperation'.\nIn her conclusion, she specifically referred to the timing of our motion. The Commission has submitted an application to the Norwegian Chair of the Arctic Council to extend the international Convention on the Law of the Sea. That has to be accepted by unanimity, and the vote is on 29 April - in three or four weeks' time. So she very clearly asked for a postponement, even though she fully shares our sentiments. On that basis, could I suggest we consider referring it back to committee?\nDiana Wallis\nMr President, could I say on behalf of the ALDE Group that we would support Mrs Doyle's proposition? I think it has much merit. The House had a resolution on this issue in October of last year. To a certain extent we are repeating what we said then, but we are also saying some things that are rather stronger and, as Mrs Doyle said, they come at a critical moment when most of us in this House would want to see the EU take up a seat on the Arctic Council, and we would not wish to compromise that.\nIt would be much better to ref", "3. Credit rating agencies (\nJean-Paul Gauz\u00e8s\nMr President, this is a purely technical amendment, to take into account the date that the regulation establishing the European Securities and Markets Authority will come into effect and the fact that this regulation can only come into effect at a later date.\nWe should consequently adapt one recital and one article of the text on which we are going to vote. In recital 22, we should cut the second sentence and in article two, I also suggest that we cut the second sentence. This oral amendment has been the subject of an item of information and an agreement by the different groups that signed the compromise agreement. This text we will be voting on today completes the regulation of rating agencies and is part of the European Union's policy to improve the regulation of financial services.\nI should like to take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Barnier and the Belgian Presidency for their very strong involvement in this issue.\n", "1. Draft general budget of the European Union - Financial year 2008 (vote) \n- Before the vote\nKy\u00f6sti Virrankoski\nMr President, before the beginning of the vote, I want to make the following statement.\nAs you know, the Committee on Budgets voted on more than 1 600 amendments to the 2008 draft budget. Inevitably, there are a small number of technical adjustments that I hereby request to be put to the vote in plenary.\nAfter the vote, the Committee on Budgets issued a request to retable the following four amendments:\nAmendment 990: + EUR 1.53m on line 16 03 04, commitment appropriations only;\nAmendment 24: on line 15 05 55, commitment appropriations only, reserve and remarks as in Amendment 938;\nAmendment 989: + EUR 1 million on line 16 03 02, commitment appropriations, and + EUR 1 million in payment appropriations;\nAmendment 1043: + EUR 1 million on line 15 06 06, commitment appropriations, and + EUR 1 million in payment appropriations, plus additional remarks from Amendment 25, with the figure EUR 1 million instead of EUR 1.5 million.\nThese technical changes and specifications were dealt with and approved at the meeting of Committee on Budgets of 11 October 2007.\nAs regards Frontex, a technical error was identified subsequent to the vote in committee concerning the remarks. The correct modification to the remarks is contained in Amendment 1133, which is annexed to the voting list.\nFinally, the remarks adopted in Amendment 634 do not appear in Amendments 1018 on budget line 15 02 02 05; 934 on budget line 09 06 01; 938 on budget line 15 05 55, and 940 on budget line 17 02 02. And, on budget line 09 03 03, the right figure for commitment appropriations should be 5 and payment appropriations 4.85.\nI ask the Sittings Service to make the necessary corrections in the Minutes.\nOn top of that, we held a discussion at the coordinators' meeting yesterday and, according to their decisions, I recommend rejecting Amendment 752 and voting in favour of Amendment 610 on line 16 02 02", "Shipwreck of the Erika\nPresident\nThe next item is the oral question (B5-0011/2000) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, to the Commission, on the shipwreck of the Erika.\n\nVarela Suanzes-Carpegna\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I want to warmly thank Mr Fischler for being here today. Our President told us yesterday that the Commissioner would be unable to attend today due to prior commitments. He must have reconsidered and, in so doing, has, as usual, shown great respect for this House. I thank him for this.\nOn behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, I must highlight our concerns about the shipwreck of the tanker Erika. There are two political reasons why our committee and myself as its chairman must speak out about this issue. Firstly, we must show the Commission, the Council and the Member States that this House cannot and will not forget about this serious incident. Secondly, we must focus today on one specific aspect of this terrible environmental disaster, namely its effect on the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected regions.\nThe epilogue to this disaster must surely be the urgent adoption of measures to minimise the damage and to prevent this happening again in the future. Enough regrets and thoughts have been expressed about this event. We must now get down to adopting measures, Commissioner. Firstly, efficient controls are needed in Community waters and ports in order to ensure safety in maritime transport, particularly where oil and dangerous goods are involved.\nThe construction of these vessels, the use of double hulls, their age, their control by classification companies, insurance, the creation of databases containing all relevant information, Community cooperation and coordination, the reinforcement of control by inspectors and the liability of carriers and owners of cargoes are all issues which must be tackled. Who better than the European Commission to make serious proposals for Eu", "1. 2007, amended by the Council (vote) \n- Before the vote:\nJames Elles \nrapporteur. - Mr President, as every year in this major exercise, there are a few technical corrections that need to be made at this stage. I will be very brief. I think the vote also will be as brief as I have known it.\nFirstly, on Amendment 328 to line 22 02 02 'Transition and institution-building assistance to potential candidate countries': this is accepted with + EUR 2 million for commitments and payments. These EUR 2 million are taken from line 19 05 01 'Cooperation with industrialised non-member countries'. As a result, Amendment 314 to line 19 05 01 is withdrawn.\nSecondly, EUR 5 million in commitments and payments is added to line 16 02 02: 'Multimedia actions'.\nThirdly, EUR 400 000 in commitments and payments is added to line 15 04 47: 'European Year for Intercultural Dialogue'.\nWith regard to the amounts in reserve which are released: Amendment 302 to line 16 03 02 - 'Local actions' - the reserve is lifted; Amendment 251 on 'European Schools' - line 26 01 50 23; lastly, Amendment 330 to 28 01 01 - 'Staff in active employment in the audit policy area'.\nAs regards EPSO, that is Amendment 255: it is replaced by an amendment to reduce the amounts in reserve to 25% of the appropriations on the relevant budget lines.\nFinally, to take account of a problem on pre-accession assistance which arose from the Council's reading, and which we were not able to pick up quickly enough, we ask the Commission at the end of paragraph 25 of the resolution, 'to present a transfer request or amending budget during the course of 2007 if the amounts foreseen in the 2007 budget turn out to be insufficient'. This concerns budget line 05 05 01 01.\nI recommend that we vote on these particular elements which I have put forward as technical adjustments.\n(Parliament accepted the technical amendments proposed by the rapporteur)\nUlla-Maj Wideroos\nPresident-in-Office of the Council.

Composition of the Conference of Presidents (amendment of Rule 23) (vote) \n- Report: Papastamkos\n- Before the vote:\nGeorgios Papastamkos  \nMr President, the number of non attached Members may be increased at any time, owing to unforeseen events. This is in line with the political cohesion of existing political groups and with the possibility of achieving consensus among the non-attached Members, provided there are enough to form a political group.\nIn terms of legislative policy, the provisions of the Rules of Procedure concerning the composition of the Conference of Presidents should thus not be confined to cases where the number of non-attached Members is small.\nThe Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament contain provisions of primarily long-term validity. They should produce useful results, not only at the time of legislation or amendment, but also under changing circumstances in the future.\nFor this reason, ad hoc situations, which may change at any moment and indeed may change back to the previous status quo, should not result each time in the adoption of new regulations. This issue touches on parliamentary sovereignty, parliamentary autonomy and Parliament's ability to organise itself, and I would ask you to vote in favour.\n", "Misleading business directories (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the oral question to the Commission by Erminia Mazzoni and Malcolm Harbour, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on misleading business directories (\u039f-000087/2011 - \u03927-0315/2011).\nSimon Busuttil\ndeputising for the author. - Madam President, two and a half years ago, I presented to this plenary a report on misleading business directories. The message that this Parliament gave was clear: that there is a serious problem with fraudulent practices by misleading business directories, that tens of thousands of our small businesses, voluntary organisations, and even charities, are falling victim to these fraudulent practices, and that we need a concerted approach to stop once and for all such deceptive practices.\nTwo and a half years later, unfortunately, we are back here in plenary to discuss the same subject because there has been a serious lack of action to combat the problem of misleading business directories. This is not acceptable.\nLet me remind colleagues what we are talking about here. Basically, what this involves is that a misleading business directory sends out a form, which appears to simply request people to update their own personal details or their business details, in return for what appears to be a free entry, a free listing in the business directory. At first glance, one does not notice any cost, any payment that might result from filling in this form. However, after submitting the form, victims receive a letter demanding payment of EUR 1 000 per year for three consecutive years. If they do not pay, the misleading business directories resort to what are essentially bullying tactics: harassing telephone calls, threats of legal action and pursuit by debt collectors.\nThe most worrying thing is that such illegal tactics are being used under the very noses of the authorities of several Member States, who are well aware of these practices and have not taken", "4.

Egypt (debate) \nPresident\n- The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Egypt.\nRa\u00fcl Romeva i Rueda\nauthor. - (ES) Madam President, I wish to begin by saying that this Parliament would be making a most serious mistake if it succumbed to pressure from those who prefer us not to discuss issues that could cause discomfort in certain countries, particularly when they denounce breaches of human rights.\nWe have privileged relations with certain countries, such as those covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy, with whom we must have a particularly clear dialogue and remind them that business cannot and must not ever be disassociated from respect for human rights, either here or there.\nThe situation in Egypt merited some reflection, and the relations between Egypt and the European Union also obliged such reflection. Thus it is more than legitimate to denounce, as we are doing in this resolution, the persecution of a number of non-governmental organisations, particularly human rights organisations, that is currently taking place in Egypt, and to lend support to the campaign for freedom of association led by a number of social movements in the country.\nPaulo Casaca\nauthor. - (PT) Madam President, I too must point out that there are of course no borders or sacred places where human rights are not a fundamental concern. However, we must take into account the fact that we had the opportunity to observe the willingness of Egypt's Foreign Minister who came on purpose to the European Parliament, to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and who was ready to answer all the questions on human rights' infringements that were put to him. I was there and I put these questions to him and obtained some answers from the Minister.\nIn addition to certain negative factors, this motion for a resolution also highlights certain positive factors that I feel are important to stress, such as the undertaking to lift the state of emergency this year, in fact within the next few mo", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nHannu Takkula\n(FI) Madam President, I would just like to say that I voted for this excellent report. Mrs Paliadeli has done a splendid job in building the European cultural heritage and its very own label.\nIn my opinion, this is one excellent indication of how, ultimately, we can achieve special added value in the European Union at little expense. I believe that the sites that will receive the European Heritage Label will definitely benefit from it. It will be visible in the number of tourists they receive and it will help to make Europe better known.\nIt is very important that we remember that Europe is united in its diversity, and it is important for us to ensure that the people of the different countries of Europe can discover the mosaiclike European identity on a wider basis.\nThat is what I wanted to say, Madam President. When people here are leaving the House, it is a little difficult to concentrate, but I hope they will have listened to what I had to say.\nAntonello Antinoro\n(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Heritage Label is of fundamental importance for a continent that contains the majority of UNESCO sites, and it finally highlights the natural, archaeological, urban and cultural sites that have had an important role in the history, culture and integration of the European Union.\nApproval of the label is an important step for the process of EU cohesion and is also educational and formative for cultural dialogue. One can also see how this decision is a good omen for future generations, who increasingly will have a shared vision of European heritage, which can bring them together historically and culturally.\nAs I thank the rapporteur for her efforts, I should like to offer her my heartfelt congratulations for the negotiations carried out with the Commission for a successful outcome to this initiative, which is so important for the future of the preservation of European culture.\nHannu Takkula\n(", "13. Asset management II (vote) \n- Report: Wolf Klinz\n- Before the vote on Amendment 2:\nMargarita Starkevi\u010di\u016bt\nMr President, I would like to clarify our amendment and insert the words: 'indirectly, for example', so the text now reads: '...the product to retail investors directly or indirectly, for example by bundling it with other retail products'.\n(The oral amendment was accepted)\n", "10.

We were in fact voting on paragraph 44(2), while the screen was displaying paragraph 44(1). There may therefore have been some confusion.\nVittorio Agnoletto\n(IT) Mr President, I should just like to confirm that, regarding the previous vote, 44(1) appeared on the screen and not 44(2), in the last vote that was cast.

It has been requested that this draft be amended as follows.\nWednesday:\nThe Socialist Group in the European Parliament has requested that Council and Commission statements on the situation in the car industry be inserted in tomorrow's agenda. It should be pointed out that, if this point is inserted, the oral question on the review of the Recommendation providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspection in the Member States will need to be moved to Thursday's agenda.\nHannes Swoboda\non behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I am sure that everybody in this House is aware that the car industry in the European Union is now in a very difficult position, in part due to the crisis in the car industry in the United States. I therefore think it would make perfect sense for the Commission to make a statement on how it views this crisis, on what possible solutions it can see, including, for example, State aid, what competition rules need to be complied with, and so on. This is, in my view, an important issue.\nI would, however, just like to add that we have no intention of weakening or postponing the environmental objectives for the car industry. We will still insist on these environmental objectives being implemented and pushed through, but at the same time we should also have the opportunity here to discuss the car industry's economic difficulties with a representative of the Commission. That is one of our concerns, and I hope that we will gain wide support for it.\nKoenraad Dillen\n(NL) Mr President, by way of point of order in accordance with Rule 7 of the Rules of Procedure, I should like to deplore the fact that the Lehne report, which should normally speaking have been the subject of discussion this evening ", "The exclusion of health services from the Services Directive (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Bernadette Vergnaud, on behalf of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the impact and consequences of the exclusion of health services from the Directive on services in the internal market.\nBernadette Vergnaud \nrapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, health services constitute one of the pillars of the European social model. That is why they have been excluded from the Services Directive and must be dealt with in their own right, as part of a more wide-ranging assessment of the health sector in Europe.\nThe Commission consultation cannot be reduced to patient mobility alone, but should be an opportunity to define what the role and the added value of the European Union might be when it comes to guaranteeing every citizen not only equal access to health care, but also a high level of health protection, in accordance with the powers of the Member States and with the principle of subsidiarity.\nEuropean health policy cannot be limited to the mobility of patients and health professionals and cannot aim solely at the implementation of an internal market in health services, as this would lead to a two-speed system, from which only the most well-off patients would benefit and where health care institutions would seek to attract the wealthiest patients. Furthermore, due to the disparity in professionals' income, medical demography problems will undermine access to health care in the Member States in which service providers do not earn as much, with these people being tempted to settle abroad. Patients must have the right to receive health care in another Member State, in accordance with freedom of movement, but there is no question of promoting medical tourism.\nAlthough health services are subject to the rules of the Treaty, they cannot be considered as ordinary commercial services because they are invested with", "3.

In so doing, we are ensuring the application of applicable EU law, preventing discrimination and barriers to market access and cutting red tape.

The European Parliament also wishes to take a position on the attitude of one Member State which has been applying a selective policy of non-cooperation for several weeks, preventing the Council from adopting important decisions for the functioning of the European Union.\nAs President of the Agriculture Council, which devoted its meeting of 3 and 4 June essentially to BSE problems, I am most grateful for the invitation to take part in this debate and report to Parliament on the outcome of the Council's last meeting.\nBut I would first like to mention the approach taken by the Agriculture Council in its discussions since the British government laid the official information on BSE before it last March. The Council has expressed its determination to take all necessary measures to ensure the protection of public health. As emphasized in the texts approved at the Council meetings of 1-3 April and 29-30 April, the priority has been to ensure a high level of health protection on the basis of the available scientific data.\nAs you know, faced with the consequences suffered by the United Kingdom and the rest of the European Union, on 27 March 1996 the Commission decided to introduce a temporary ban on the export of bovine animals, beef and beef products from the United Kingdom to other Member States and third countries, as a protective measure.\nFollowing this decision, the United Kingdom adopted a series of measures to eradicate", "One-minute speeches on matters of political importance\nPresident\nThe next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance (Rule 150).\nNuno Teixeira\n(PT) The Committee on International Trade is currently assessing the global agreement on bananas reached within the World Trade Organisation. Soon, this House will be called on to decide in plenary on the lowering of customs duties on imports of bananas from Latin American countries.\nIt should be made quite clear that none of the outermost regions, whether it be Madeira, where I come from, or one of the other eight outermost regions, particularly the Canary Islands, which are by far the worst affected, is against the conclusion of these types of agreements. What these regions want, pure and simple, is, on the one hand, that other countries are required to comply with the same hygiene and plant health conditions and respect for workers' rights as they themselves are required to in order to enter the market. That is basic justice. On the other hand, they want to be fully compensated for the damage caused to them. Failing that, they want those in charge to at least have the decency to tell them directly that they will have to change their way of life and look for other work, because it is obvious that they cannot survive in the conditions that lie ahead and will have to abandon their livelihoods. It is clear that in these agreements, there are winners and losers. Let us take care of the losers - the winners do not need our help.\nVilija Blinkevi\u010di\u016bt\n(LT) In Europe, there has been a rapid increase in the number of elderly people whose only source of livelihood is their pension. People who have worked hard and honestly all their lives, who have brought up children and paid taxes to the state, expect old age to be peaceful and dignified. Unfortunately, not all of these legitimate expectations are destined to come true. The people of Europe in particular have felt this during the economic crisis.

The following amendments have been proposed:\nMonday: Mrs Roure has withdrawn her request for a brief presentation of her report on minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers and refugees in the Member States. The report will therefore be put to the vote on Thursday.\nThursday: The Union for Europe of the Nations Group has requested that the item on the situation in the Philippines be replaced with an item entitled 'Refusal of the extradition from Brazil of Cesare Battisti'.\nRoberta Angelilli\non behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, having consulted many of my fellow Members, I would ask you for an amendment to the agenda just as you have said. Specifically, I would ask if the Battisti affair can be included as an urgent matter.\nAs a matter of fact, a few days ago, the Brazilian Government decided to refuse to extradite the terrorist Cesare Battisti, who had been sentenced to life imprisonment for committing four murders, and granted this killer the status of political refugee. This decision, as well as being an affront to the institutions and to Italian justice, is an insult to the memory of the victims and to their families, and has outraged public opinion.\nThat is the reason for this request that, among other things, I believe should be heard, and because the request initially came from the highest public officials in Italy, starting with the President of the Republic, Mr Napolitano. That is therefore the reason for the request.\n", "Human rights in the world 2009 and EU policy on the matter (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Andrikien\u0117, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2009 and the European Union's policy on the matter.\nLaima Liucija Andrikien\u0117\nrapporteur. - (LT) Madam President, Madam High Representative, I am very pleased to see you here today participating in this particularly important discussion. In particular because these are the first political debates that Baroness Ashton has participated in since the launch of the new European External Action Service.\nThe Annual Report on Human Rights in the World adopted by the Council of the European Union and EU policy in this field are the basis of this discussion and the European Parliament resolution, on which we will vote tomorrow. We cannot hold Baroness Ashton responsible for those actions that are discussed in the above report, that is 2008-2009, because at that point she had not yet assumed the post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. We understand the great responsibility that lies with you, both now and in the future, and I would like to assure you that we in the European Parliament will do all we can to ensure that the European Union's objectives in the area of foreign policy are realised.\nBaroness Ashton, the Treaty of Lisbon has been in force for a year and the European External Action Service became operational barely a fortnight ago. In its report today the European Parliament sends a clear signal to all EU institutions. The European Parliament has clearly expressed its position that in the new European External Action Service the primary focus should be democracy-building and human rights protection across the globe and that this should be reflected both in the structure of the service and its funding. There could be a Human Rights and Democracy Directorate, an international law directorate or a structure with another name", "9. Framework directive on the sustainable use of pesticides (vote) \n- Report: Christa Kla\u00df (A6-0347-2007)\n- Before the vote:\nChristopher Heaton-Harris\nMr President, I rise on a point of order under Rule 166, to invoke Rule 37(1) of our Rules of Procedure.\nRule 37(1) concerns the access to documents and provision of information to this Parliament. In the run-up to this vote on pesticides, many, if not all, in this House have been bombarded by e-mails asking us to vote for amendments that go even further than the Commission would like us to. These e-mails come from an organisation called Pesticide Watch, whose constituent organisations received large amounts of funding from the European Commission - indeed, part of the EUR 11.7 million spent in the last two years under the budget line relating to the Community action programme promoting non-governmental organisations (NGOs) primarily active in the field of environmental protection and the Life+ programme.\nUnder Rule 37(1), can I ask for the various exchanges between the Commission and these NGOs, who have been lobbying us on all these matters? This payroll lobbying has certainly led to an increase in the number of e-mails being received by MEPs, but surely it is wrong for one Commission DG to use large sums of taxpayers' money, and abuse the role of NGOs, to try and change the views of parliamentarians and the lead Commission DG on this matter.\n(Loud applause from the right)\nPresident\nMr Heaton-Harris, we will pass on your comment.\n", "Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nR\u00fcbig\nMr President, with regard to yesterday' s debate on Slovakia, I should like to point out that Belgium and other countries have introduced a visa requirement for Slovakia. I regard that as discrimination.\n\nKonrad\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, in his policy statement yesterday, Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, said that whoever weakened any institution of the European Union weakened the Union as a whole. We have, of course, debated the relations between the Commission and the Council here. I should like to refer to the relations between Parliament and the Council and to highlight the fact that there have recently been considerable delays in the Council's replies to our written questions. Let me cite two examples.\nIn September 1999 I asked a question on the subject of Hombach. It was answered in February 2000. I submitted a written question on the subject of European flight safety in February 2000 and am still awaiting a reply. Whoever weakens any institution weakens the entire Union. I have the impression that the Council in particular has now decided to ignore questions from Parliament. That is unacceptable! If we are to preserve the balance between the institutions, I believe we must take steps to ensure that this defect is rectified.\n\nPresident\nThank you.\nAre there any other comments on the Minutes?\nThere are none.\n(The Minutes were approved)   \n\nMarset Campos\nMr President, this very day we are going to enthusiastically approve - and with great interest in my case - the reports on enlargement involving candidate countries such as the Czech Republic, which is the subject of Mr J\u00fcrgen Schr\u00f6der' s report.

I should like to extend a very warm welcome to Mrs Dotan and to the members of her delegation. I should like to stress the importance that we attach to this visit.\n(Applause)\nThey are seated on the left, and I extend a cordial welcome to them.\n", "Announcement by the President\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, the Conference of Presidents has taken a unanimous decision, which I am relaying to you, addressing myself in particular to the Council.\nIn the context of its deliberations on the Commission's proposal for the amendment of the Regulation on the funding of European political parties, the Committee of Permanent Representatives decided yesterday to split the Commission's proposal in two and to adopt the necessary amendments to the Financial Regulation in a separate legislative instrument, to be created on the legal basis that applies to amendments to the Financial Regulation.\nThis would mean that key elements of this legislative process would be taken out of the sphere of parliamentary codecision and that the Commission, contrary to its own convictions, would have to present a new proposal, while it would also be essential, or at least advisable, to consult the Court of Auditors.\nThe European Parliament calls on the Council to reconsider its decision. The amendments to the Political Parties Regulation proposed by the Commission are necessary to overcome practical difficulties that have arisen in its application. They would also make it possible to continue supporting the development at the European level of political foundations, which play an important part in opening political processes to public scrutiny. For these reasons, it is imperative that the proposed regulation should enter into force very soon.\nOn 22 October, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs adopted a report expressing willingness to compromise with the Council to pave the way for the rapid adoption of the proposed regulation.\nThe splitting of this instrument by the Permanent Representatives has thwarted these efforts. It is legally unnecessary, undermines the Commission's right of initiative, curtails the rights of Parliament, and is likely to cause significant delays.\nOn behalf of the Conference of Presidents I call on the Council to ove", "Statements by the President\nPresident\nI would like to inform you that during this part-session additional camera operators with special equipment will be present in the Chamber. Just as during the Brussels part-session, they are going to film our debates and votes to produce a widescreen film about Parliament's work for the new visitor centre in Brussels. There is going to be an exhibition on this subject in Brussels. I have obtained an emphatic assurance that the technicians will be very discreet and will not interfere in any way with the progress of the sitting. Thank you for your understanding. We would like as many Europeans as possible to be familiar with the way Parliament works.\nSeventy years ago, on 17 June 1940, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were attacked by the Red Army and illegally annexed to the Soviet Union. This was a direct consequence of a pact made between Hitler and Stalin in September 1939, which also gave the USSR control of Finland and part of the territory of Poland and Romania. The European Parliament - our Parliament - was the first international organisation to condemn the fact that the Baltic countries had been occupied. This was in a resolution made 27 years ago in January 1983, which also recalled that the occupation had not been recognised by most of the countries of Europe or the United States.\nLet us remember, too, the first anniversary of the elections in Iran, particularly in view of the intense repression which is being widely used there. Last year, the authorities carried out 488 executions and imprisoned thousands of people. Many political prisoners are awaiting execution because they are said to have played a role in last year's demonstrations. The European Parliament expresses its greatest alarm at the situation, especially in view of the lack of free speech and the right of assembly. The European Union, and Parliament in particular, is permanently opposed to capital punishment, regardless of the circumstances.\nToday, in Milan,", "3.

The main problem was the way events were handled in Moscow, rather than in Tallinn, and we would therefore prefer the text to read 'the events in Moscow'. That would seem more appropriate.\n(Parliament rejected the oral amendment)\nBart Staes\n(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I should like to attempt, by means of an oral amendment, a better and more correct wording to the second part of Paragraph 11, which would then read as follows, and I will read it out in English: 'in particular by means of enhanced dialogue over Ukraine en Belarus and joint efforts to finally resolve the frozen conflicts in Moldova en the South Caucasus'. 'Nagorno-Karabakh and Georgia' would therefore be deleted and replaced by 'in Moldova and the South Caucasus'.\n(Parliament rejected the oral amendment)\n", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote.\nZuzana Roithov\u00e1\n(CS) Mr President, land and sea frontiers have shifted with enlargement, increasing customs officers' work from simple custom duties checks to combating counterfeiting, money laundering, drugs, and evasion of antidumping duties or health measures aimed at consumer protection. For this reason I have welcomed and expressed support for the Commission's proposal, which will allow a greater degree of coordination of Member States' bodies, including close cooperation with Europol, Frontex, Interpol and the World Customs Organisation. We would also ask that the third country authorities that will obtain commercial and personal data from the Member States be required to guarantee data protection standards equivalent to those in the EU. I thank the Members for having supported our Group's proposals today in full. I also want to thank the rapporteurs for their meticulous work.\nPhilip Claeys\n(NL) Mr President, I voted for the Musotto report because it is not afraid to speak frankly about many aspects of fraud and measures to combat fraud. And I get that d\u00e9ja vu feeling when the report mentions the millions of funds wrongly paid and non-eligible expenditure claimed. Think, for example, of the hundreds of millions of euros in European funds which have already disappeared into the bottomless pit of the corrupt socialist-dominated Walloon state. A state in which numerous officials have been involved in scandals, in some cases for misappropriation of funds. When the report talks about the fragility of Commission scrutiny, I automatically remember the words of my Walloon colleague Mr Deprez who talked at the beginning of the month about bad projects which are the fault not only of Wallonia but also of the Commission because it approves these projects.\nHubert Pirker\n(DE) Mr President, the report that was originally presented was a good one, because it provided for clearly defined measures to support the fight against ter", "Cooperation between the Fundamental Rights Agency and the Council of Europe (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Adamos Adamou, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision relating to the conclusion of an Agreement between the European Community and the Council of Europe on cooperation between the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights and the Council of Europe - C6-0311/2007 -.\nFranco Frattini\nMember of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank Parliament and, particularly, the rapporteur, Mr Adamou, for the continuous and constructive cooperation as well as the support in reaching this very important cooperation agreement.\nThe establishment of the Agency for Fundamental Rights was a big success for the promotion and respect of fundamental rights in the European Union. It is also a success in terms of interinstitutional cooperation. I have always been committed to ensuring that this important initiative is fully supported by the three institutions. Smooth cooperation between the European Union and the Council of Europe is crucial for ensuring the success of the Agency.\nThe draft Council decision reflects this objective. It represents the genuine will of the two organisations to work together, and I am delighted to see that the negotiations for the agreement have been swift and made in a very constructive way by both parties.\nThis important agreement will enable the Agency to work to the best of its capabilities. Indeed, in order to be fully operational, a number of measures have already been taken, and some are still in the pipeline. This agreement will help foster a comprehensive cooperation framework. It will help to provide a structure platform for both bodies, making mutual dialogue and common action both more possible and more efficient.\nIt will also help avoid the duplication of work between the two bodies. The agreement provides for regular contacts and mee", "The European Union strategy for the Baltic Sea region and the role of macro-regions in the future cohesion policy (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Wojciech Micha\u0142 Olejniczak, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the European Union strategy for the Baltic Sea region and the role of macro-regions in the future cohesion policy.\nWojciech Micha\u0142 Olejniczak\nMr President, to begin with, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for our fruitful work together, which has enabled production of a document which is of great significance for a number of areas of the Union's work. The report on the European Union strategy for the Baltic Sea region and the role of macro-regions in future cohesion policy emphasises regional cooperation in order to implement measures covering a number of policies, including transport, fisheries, energy and agricultural policy, as well as scientific research. A real possibility of putting this ambitious plan into effect arose in 2004, when the number of Baltic states found in European Union structures increased to eight out of nine.\nThe priority elements of macro-regional cooperation are transport policy and environmental protection. These are linked by the necessity of reducing discrepancies in infrastructural standards as well as by the fact that they illustrate perfectly the structure of dependence on the part of Member States which is characteristic of this approach. There can be no effective measures to combat pollution and contamination of the ecosystem in the Baltic region without integrated action from each of the countries which are situated around its shores.\nSecondly, macro-regional cooperation undoubtedly produces and contributes to the creation of conditions which favour the development of innovation. Using the huge intellectual potential of its residents, we can bring about an increase in the competitiveness of the economy of the entire macro-region. This fact, in turn, will have signif", "Community railways\nPresident. -\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following four reports, drawn up on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism:\nA5-0417/2002 by Mr Jarzembowski on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 91/440/EEC on the development of the Community's railways (COM(2002) 25 - C5-0038/2002 - 2002/25(COD));\nA5-0424/2002 by Mr Sterckx on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on safety on the Community's railways and amending Council Directive 95/18/EC on the licensing of railway undertakings and Directive 2001/14/EC on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and safety certification (COM(2002) 21 - C5-0039/2002 - 2002/0022(COD));\nA5-0418/2002 by Mrs Ainardi on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 96/48/EC and Directive 2001/16/EC on the interoperability of the trans-European rail system (COM(2002) 2- C5-0045/2002 - 2002/0023(COD)) and\nA5-0441/2002 by Mr Savary on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on establishing a European Railway Agency (COM(2002) 23 - C5-0046/2002 - 2002/0024(COD)).\n\nDe Palacio\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to warmly thank the four rapporteurs for the excellent work they have done, which means that the plenum is being presented with some generally positive reports, which move in the same direction as the Commission's proposal and support the Commission's approach.\nI would like to thank Parliament, which, furthermore, has dealt with these reports as a global package, resisting the temptation to divide it up, which would undoubtedly have hindered our common objective of finally creating a genuine European rail area.\nLadies and gentlemen, this is the second stage of a prolonged process. Following the entry into force on 15 March 2001 of the three directives o", "Explanations of vote\nWritten explanations of vote:\nWilliam \nin writing. - The Governor of the Bank of England (Mervyn King) has stated, and I believe correctly, 'Banks are international in life but national in death...'. It is national governments and national taxpayers who pay when banks have to be bailed out. It follows therefore that banking supervision must be carried out on a national basis and not via the EU. This is why I voted against the setting-up of an EU special committee on the financial and economic crisis.\nMaria Da Gra\u00e7a Carvalho  \nSetting up the special committee on the financial and economic crisis as a body to analyse and evaluate the coordination of the measures taken by the Member States to support sustainable qualitative growth is crucial. It is essential to analyse and evaluate the extent of the social, economic and financial crisis, but also to propose appropriate measures for the long-term reconstruction of sound, stable financial markets able to support sustainable economic growth which can combat unemployment and respond to demographic and climate challenges.\nIt is crucial to support the involvement of universities, representatives of the scientific community and researchers as strategic partners. This partnership must be promoted, since it will be decisive for us to be able to tackle both the economic crisis and unemployment problems in the short term, as well as to find long-term solutions to deal with the problem of climate change, by developing and using clean forms of energy.\nDiogo Feio  \nSetting up the special committee on the financial and economic crisis may prove to be crucial in preparing for the future of the EU. This future could not be achieved by discussing and proposing measures alone, but also by devising mechanisms that can be implemented to avoid us facing a similar situation in the not too distant future. It is therefore vital to learn the lessons of this crisis by examining its causes and consequences. It is also importa", "Order of business\nPresident\nThe final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 9 December 2010, pursuant to Rules 137 and 138 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed.\nThe following amendments have been proposed:\nWednesday\nI have received a request from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) that Mr Sz\u00e1jer's report concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commissions' exercise of implementing powers be added to the order of business.\nJ\u00f3zsef Sz\u00e1jer\nMr President, as you rightly said, our group is asking for the regulation on implementing acts to be put on the agenda. I feel a little awkward doing this, because it is not only my group's request; several other groups support this idea. We had a unanimous vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs on this report and on the various common understandings and statements that were annexed to it.\nI would like to remind colleagues that the Lisbon Treaty entered into force a year ago. This regulation on implementing acts follows a year of very hard negotiations in an area where the new delegated and implementing acts are a very important issue for this Parliament. After one year, I think we can fully exercise this right. This is why it would be good to discuss and adopt this new regulation.\nI would also like to inform you - as our colleagues know - that there was a very difficult situation in the Council with two blocking minorities. It is therefore a very delicate act, which is why I think that the right thing to do is to get through it as soon as possible. All Parliament's rights are met in this report. I ask for the support of all the other groups.\nPresident\nThank you, Mr Sz\u00e1jer. Is there support for this proposal?\nHannes Swoboda\n(DE) Mr President, we have no objection to this topic being placed on the agenda. However, I should like to draw your attention to the fact that members of some committees - and not just from our g", "The role of women in industry (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Ilda Figueiredo, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on the role of women in industry.\nThis report is very important and is likely to receive a great deal of media attention.\nIlda Figueiredo\nrapporteur. - (PT) I must start by thanking the members and staff of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for their support and valuable contributions, particularly through their proposals on this report which enabled its unanimous approval. This work took several months and included a public hearing with valuable contributions being made by members of both parliamentary committees and external guests, particularly social organisations.\nThis report seeks to highlight the role of women in industry. On average, over 14% of women in employment in the European Union work in industry. In some countries this percentage exceeds 25%, such as in Bulgaria and the Czech Republic, and in others it is around 20%, such as in Portugal, Greece and Hungary.\nWe know that in some industrial sectors women represent the majority of workers, such as in textiles, garments and footwear, areas of the food industry, cork, cabling, and electrical and electronic equipment, whereas their participation in cutting-edge technology sectors is limited. This means that we need different approaches, but with one common goal of promoting the women working in these sectors, guaranteeing non-discriminatory practices in access to employment and contracting, wage equality, creation of career opportunities, vocational training, good working conditions and better pay, and respecting maternity and paternity as fundamental social values.\nThe need to guarantee employment with rights for women working in industry and to keep facilitating their access to jobs in this important sector of production also requires more atte", "Energy performance of buildings (recast) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the recommendation for second reading by Silvia-Adriana \u0162ic\u0103u, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the Council's position at first reading for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the energy performance of buildings (recast) (05386/3/2010 - C7-0095/2010 -.\nSilvia-Adriana \u0162ic\u0103u\nIn 2008, the EU undertook to cut energy consumption by 20%, as well as to ensure that 20% of the energy consumed comes from renewable sources by 2020. As part of the European Council meeting held on 25 and 26 March 2010, European Union leaders set a common target of a 20% increase in energy efficiency by 2020.\nBuildings are responsible for 40% of the total consumption of energy, as well as for 35% of polluting emissions. Improving the energy performance of buildings will have a major impact on European citizens' lives. Across the EU, families spend, on average, 33% of their incomes on water, electricity, gas and maintenance. In fact, this figure can even reach 54% in the case of families with very low incomes. Investments in improving energy efficiency will result not only in lower energy bills, but also in creating 2.7 million jobs in the EU by 2030.\nIn November 2008, the Commission tabled a legislative proposal for reforming Directive 91/2002 concerning the energy performance of buildings. In April 2009, the European Parliament adopted by a huge majority its position at first reading as part of the codecision procedure. Subsequently, Parliament and the Council conducted intense negotiations during the Swedish Presidency of the Council of the European Union. In November 2009, a political agreement was reached on the technical aspects of the legislative proposal.\nThis agreement has the following main achievements.\nA separate article was introduced, along with several recitals and provisions concerning funding-related aspects.

As the Rule stands, it regulates such proceedings only in cases where the European Parliament brings an action before the Court.\nHowever, the text does not tell us what happens when Parliament decides to state its views through its representative, the President, by submitting observations or intervening in prejudicial proceedings. These proceedings serve to contest the validity of a legislative act that the European Parliament itself has approved within the framework of the co-decision procedure.\nA question has therefore been put by the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, Mr Gargani, whom I would like to take this opportunity to thank for his help in preparing this report. He asks whether this procedure of intervention and submission of comments is covered by Rule 121, and if not, what we should do.\nThe first answer I give in my report is that one procedure cannot be considered to be included in the other; that the word 'action', used in Rule 121, cannot be considered to include the qualitatively different case of submission of comments or intervention in Court. On this basis, the first answer is that we cannot proceed merely on the basis of interpretation.\nCan we stick to the Parliamentary practice whereby the decision in such cases lies with the President of Parliament, as our head and representative in court cases? Once again, I think the answer is no. A more reliable course of action is to work out a new procedure in detail.\nWhy, though, is this really so? Because there have in practice been o", "Opening of the sitting\n(The sitting was opened at 9.05 a.m.)\nHannes Swoboda\non behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I should like to come back to a decision that was made yesterday afternoon. However, I must put on record that neither the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, nor the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, or any of the other groups were informed about the wish for us to adopt a resolution on Russia this time, even though this has been repeatedly rejected in the Conference of Presidents.\nWe must, of course, take note of the decision. However, I should like to record here - and we shall also inform the groups that have requested this, particularly the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe - that we are not asking for this resolution to be adopted now, but at Parliament's next sitting instead. I should simply like to record this here.\nWe must, of course, formally abide by the rules. However, we do want to say here, out of fairness to the Greens and Liberals, that we are asking for this resolution to be adopted not this week, but at the next plenary session. The Socialist Group will be voting on it in any case and I believe the EPP has a similar idea.\nJoseph Daul\nMr President, actually I totally support Mr Swoboda, since we were not told and therefore have not prepared anything for this resolution this week. Our group, like the PSE Group, did not know about this, and we ask you to postpone the vote to the next part-session.\nPresident\nThank you, we take note of your request. It will be passed on to the other groups as appropriate and we will see how the matter can be resolved.\n", "30.

The Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO) has prepared this report in a few months and has also finalised a report on the amendment of Parliament's Rules of Procedure.\nPersonally, I was very surprised at the amount of public attention that this transparency agreement has garnered. I fear that people think the results will have a greater effect than was actually pursued. Transparency is the defence of right political action, but it is not the right instrument for getting to the heart of corruption. The recent cases of journalists trying to corrupt a few MEPs could also happen outside parliamentary premises. Furthermore, would-be corruptors know how to avoid being identified and the registers are not, therefore, a silver bullet.\nThe right tool for the job is criminal law. Yet if t", "14. Authorisation and refusal of authorisation of certain health claims made on foods and referring to children's development and health (\nBefore the vote\nGlenis Willmott\nMr President, MEPs have an important role to play in scrutinising decisions on health claims. I have received many letters and emails of concern from parents, major health and consumer organisations, midwives, nurses and doctors' organisations, as well as Unicef and the WHO. Until there is real consensus in the scientific community about the validity of this claim, we must not allow it. The evidence we currently have is not conclusive and no evidence exists to support the use of such a claim on follow-on formulas.\nIf, in the future, synthesised DHA is proven to be truly beneficial to babies, we should make it an essential ingredient in all formulas, and not allow it to be used as a marketing ploy by a specific brand. I would urge you to support this resolution.\nEsther de Lange\nMr President, I definitely do not want to reopen the debate, but we really should think twice about giving the floor to people who can put their personal opinion forward under the disguise of scientific evidence. Let us just vote. We have made up our minds.\n(Applause)\n", "Presentation of the Court of Auditors' annual report - 2008 (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the presentation of the Court of Auditors' annual report.\nV\u00edtor Manuel da Silva Caldeira\nPresident of the Court of Auditors. - Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honour for me to have the opportunity to take part in your debate today about the Annual Report of the European Court of Auditors on the implementation of the budget for the 2008 financial year, which I have already presented to you, Mr President, and to the Committee on Budgetary Control on 10 November.\nWe have four key messages in this year's annual report.\nFirst, the Court gives an unqualified opinion on the accounts for the second year running. It concludes that the accounts present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results and cash-flows of the European Union at the year's end. In other words, the final accounts for 2008 present a true and fair view, although due attention should be paid to addressing weaknesses in the systems of a number of directorates-general of the Commission.\nAs regards the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions, the second key message is that there has been an overall decrease in the level of irregularity in recent years. But the level of irregularity remains too high in some areas.\nAs in previous years, for 2008, the Court gives an unqualified opinion on Revenue and on commitments. The picture for payments, however, continues to be mixed.\nFor Administrative and other expenditure, the Court gives an unqualified opinion as in previous years. The Court also gives an unqualified opinion on education and citizenship, estimating that the error rate has fallen below 2%. This result is mainly due to a high proportion of advance payments in 2008, which have a lower risk of error than interim and final payments. Systems in this area continue, however, to be assessed as only partially effective.\nFor Agriculture and natural re", "100th anniversary of International Women's Day\nPresident\nI am extremely pleased to be able to preside over our Parliament together with my female fellow Members. Six of them are Vice-Presidents of Parliament, two are Quaestors, and the Vice-Chair of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality is sitting next to me. This is a particular honour and privilege for me.\nI am resuming the sitting. The next item is the debate on the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day. We shall begin with a short film summarising the history of this notable day. Please start the projection.\n(Projection of a film)\nDear guests, ladies and gentlemen, a film lasting two minutes cannot show everything that has happened over the past 100 years. We have, in fact, changed Europe in this time, and we Europeans can be proud when we compare Europe to many places in the world, but at the same time, we know that our journey is not over. There are still too few women in politics, and here in the European Parliament, our female Members account for only 35% of all Members. This figure is admittedly somewhat higher than in the national parliaments, but it is still not enough. Fortunately, the figure in our Parliament's main decision-making bodies is well over 40%, and we are very pleased about this. This is also the case for the chairs of the committees.\nYet the European Parliament's formation in three years' time, after the next elections, essentially depends on the national parliaments and the way in which representatives are appointed to the European Parliament. It is our national parliaments that must ensure that the number of women in the European Parliament increases. We are calling on them today to do so, and we are calling on our counterparts in the national parliaments to ensure that appropriate legal solutions are found and the appropriate decisions are taken to facilitate an increase in the number of women in the European Parliament.\nWe can also set an example when it comes to ", "Agriculture in areas with natural handicaps: A special health check (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Herbert Dorfmann, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on agriculture in areas with natural handicaps: a special health check -.\nHerbert Dorfmann\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in this report, we are concerned with a communication from the Commission regarding agriculture in areas with natural handicaps.\nSpecifically, it is about delimiting disadvantaged areas and, in particular, about finding new ways of delimiting them. They are currently defined on the basis of mainly or exclusively national criteria. There are over 100 of these criteria, and they are completely different in the different Member States of our Union.\nThis does not ensure uniformity, a state of affairs that the Court of Auditors has criticised on a number of occasions. In its communication, the Commission is now proposing a new way of delimiting these areas using eight different criteria, which are intended to lead to a complete re-definition of these areas.\nParliament does not know what impact these criteria will have because the area simulations that the Commission asked for from the Member States were not available when we were working on this report, nor did we get to look at these simulations.\nI would like to summarise what we are now proposing in this report. We think that, in principle, a uniform method of delimitation is sensible and possibly also necessary to ensure uniformity within the European Union. We also believe that the compensatory allowance - which you could say is the most important result of this delimiting process, as this is primarily carried out so that these areas can receive compensatory payments - is an extremely important element of agricultural policy and, above all, makes agriculture possible where it would otherwise be very difficult, in other words, in disadvantaged areas, especially in mount", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of Tuesday 13 January have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nR\u00fcbig\nMr President, it is stated in the Minutes that over the last ten years the US dollar has been devalued by 50 %, causing the loss of 18 million jobs. In fact only 1.3 million jobs have been lost.\n\nPresident\nMr R\u00fcbig, I think you are referring to the verbatim report of proceedings. However, we shall look into the matter.\n(The Minutes were approved)\n\nMembership of political groups\nPresident\nI must inform you that Mr Kerr is now a member of the Green Group in the European Parliament, with effect from 1 January 1998.\n\nKerr\nMr President, I just wanted to thank you for that announcement and to point out that in yesterday's minutes that I am listed as being part of the Socialist Group. I know that this will be a great embarrassment to my leader, Pauline, and I therefore would ask you to correct that.\n(Laughter )\n\nPresident\nThank you very much, Mr Kerr. The Minutes will be corrected.\n\nTopical and urgent debate (objections)\nPresident\nThe next item is the voting on objections concerning the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.\n\nHory\nMr President, a point of order before we vote on the objections introduced regarding matters of urgency, on the one hand from the Green Group regarding Tibet, and on the other the Liberal Group, regarding Kenya.\nOur group is in agreement with these objections, but as the two groups did not announce them at the Conference of Presidents, we have not been able to submit our group's resolutions on the same subject for review. Thus, if you are in agreement, I would like our resolutions B4-1476/98 regarding Tibet and B4-0084/98 regarding Kenya, also to be submitted to the vote which is going to take place.\n\nPresident\nWe will deal with the matter immediately.\n\nBritish Presidency and the situation in Algeria\nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council on the British Presidency", "Cross-border collective copyright management (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Katalin L\u00e9vai, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the Commission recommendation of 18 October 2005 on collective cross-border management of copyright and related rights for legitimate online music services (2005/737/EC).\nKatalin L\u00e9vai \nrapporteur. - Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs and other colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs for the overwhelming support they have given me. The unanimous support of the Committee on Legal Affairs was a great honour and privilege for me.\nLet me start by underlining the importance of the copyright sector, which represents 5-7 % of the EU's GDP. It is therefore important to ensure that copyright and neighbouring rights in this increasingly growing digital domain are managed properly to the benefit of all involved.\nFor this reason, I have to say that I am not at all happy with the 'soft law' approach taken by the Commission, since it failed to involve the European Parliament and the Member States in regulating this area, which is of growing economic importance and therefore absolutely relevant to the proper functioning of the internal market.\nThe Commission has set a precedent in a very important and sensitive domain: by failing to consult Parliament or the Council, it has bypassed the democratic process. I believe we all agree that the legislative triangle cannot be ignored.\nI am fully committed to the preservation of European cultural diversity. I believe that this issue should be placed in the front line of the debate. Any potential negative effects on cultural diversity in Europe must be avoided.\nThe Committee on Culture and Education has done an excellent job in highlighting the undesirable implications - one could even say negative effects - for cultural diversity of the Commission's recommendation. As you may have noticed, the Culture Committee's major concerns and demands, as we", "Report on Competition Policy 2008 (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Sophia in 't Veld, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Policy, on competition policy 2008 -\nSophia in 't Veld\nrapporteur. - Mr President, Commissioners, dear colleagues - also those who are leaving the room right now - this report was adopted by a large majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) and it is the fruit of a joint effort of all political groups. I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs - who are still present as far as I can see - for their excellent cooperation.\nECON welcomes, in particular, the emphasis on consumers. The previous Commissioner, Mrs Kroes, did a splendid job of making the consumer the focus of the competition policies, and we trust Commissioner Almunia will build on that.\nThat brings me to the first big issue, namely that of cartels. We discussed at great length issues like the most effective sanctions, the fairness of high fines and the feasibility of criminal sanctions.\nHowever, before I enter into the details of our discussions, I would like to remind European companies that the best guarantee for escaping sanctions is by simply not engaging in cartels. You may think that you are outsmarting the competition authorities but, in reality, you are doing harm to the consumer. Cartels are not smart. They are reprehensible.\nWe therefore welcome the firm stance taken by the European Commission on anti-competitive behaviour. It is essential that sanctions punish bad behaviour, in particular, of repeat offenders, but they must encourage compliance at the same time. Sanctions must have a sufficiently deterrent effect. High fines are an effective tool but, as a single instrument, they may be too blunt. Therefore, we invite the Commission to come up with proposals to make the toolkit more sophisticated and more effective. In the report, we suggest looking at issues such as individual responsibility, transp", "11. Israeli military operation against the humanitarian flotilla and the Gaza blockade (\n- Before the vote\nCharles Tannock\nMr President, by way of protest, the ECR Group will not be voting for the joint resolution. We are voting against it because the ALDE coordinators organising the joint motion did not bother to invite our ECR Group to participate in the negotiations, on the presumption that we would not sign the joint text.\nIn all my 11 years as an MEP I have never experienced this before. This is against all the conventions and traditions of this House and must not happen again. Because of the order of voting, we will not even have a chance to vote on our own resolution.\nPresident\nMr Tannock, let me just point out that what you have just said was more appropriately slated for the explanation of votes section of the sitting, but thank you.\n", "Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting\nPresident\nYesterday' s Minutes have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nPosselt\nMr President, I must apologise, because this is not a comment on yesterday 's Minutes, but on the Minutes from the day before yesterday. Unfortunately, I noticed too late that my name was not on the attendance register. However, I was here the entire day and took part in all the roll-call votes and other votes. I would be grateful if this could therefore be corrected.\n\nPresident\n Mr Posselt, of course the Minutes will be corrected to reflect the true situation.\n\nStaes\nMr President, Mrs Maes is not present in the Chamber. She is attending a Bureau meeting of our group. But I noticed that she is not listed on yesterday' s attendance register. She was quite definitely there. She spoke in the debate on the Swedish Presidency. I would ask you to amend the attendance register accordingly.\n\nPresident\n That will certainly be done, Mr Staes.\n(Parliament adopted the Minutes)   \n\nLaguiller\nMr President, on Monday afternoon, Parliament proposed that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs should look into the situation of the workers of the European corporation, Danone, threatened with the loss of 3000 jobs in the biscuit sector, 1700 of which are in France. We do not know when the committee is going to meet to discuss this matter and it is very urgent as the European Board of Danone is going to meet tomorrow.\nToday, the workers of this company, in France at least, are on strike. I would like to hear your reply on the subject of this inquiry and, in the meantime, on behalf of myself and my fellow party members, I would like to express solidarity with these workers. It is appalling that a corporation worth millions should be able to drive thousands of workers throughout Europe into unemployment and poverty.\n\nPresident\n Mrs Laguiller, I would suggest that, given the importance and the nature of the matter, you speak to the chairman of the C", "\n\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is the recommendation (A6-0165/2006) by Mrs Angelika Niebler on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality for second reading of the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation (new version) (15623/7/2005 \u2013 C6 0089/2006 \u2013 2004/0084(COD)) \nAngelika Niebler (PPE-DE ),\n\u00a0\u00a0 . \u2013 Mr President, Commissioner, today sees us voting on the Common Position on what is being called a recast directive, one that has been the subject of very prolonged negotiation between the Council and this House, and thus it is that an important legislative process is drawing to its close.\nBefore I embark on discussing the directive, I would like to extend warm thanks to the shadow rapporteur for her friendly and constructive cooperation, and also to thank the Luxembourg, UK and Austrian presidencies for having worked together with this House to make a solution possible at all. My thanks also go to the Commission, whose officials dealing with these matters have always been supportive and professional, so thank you, everyone!\nWhat is this directive all about? It has to do with Europe\u2019s rules on the equal treatment of women and men in the workplace. There are seven directives dealing with this issue, with forty years\u2019 worth of legal rulings relating to them. By means of this recast directive, on which we will be voting at midday today, we are for once actually doing some better lawmaking, in that we have, in it, summarised the law, condensed it and simplified it, and streamlined it.\nThis recast directive, for the first time, provides standard definitions of such concepts as \u2018discrimination\u2019 or \u2018sexual harassment\u2019. It standardises and improves legal protection for the victims of discrimination in the workplace. We have also, working together with the Council, succeed", "Commission fines in antitrust cases (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on Commission fines in antitrust cases.\nMichel Barnier\nMadam President, it is, as ever, a great pleasure to be here with you day and night, and I speak on behalf of my colleague and friend, Mr Almunia, who has been held up as we speak at the working dinner between China and the European Union. Your House has asked the Commission to voice its policy on fines in the fight against anti-competitive practices. On its behalf, therefore, I am delighted to make this presentation.\nAs you know, the Commission is duty bound to fight anti-competitive practices and to penalise them when they are detrimental to companies and consumers in the internal market.\nThe primary tool that we have at our disposal is our power to impose fines on companies involved in these cartels, which adopt restrictive business practices or abuse their dominant position. These fines are fixed in accordance with our guidelines on the method of setting fines. The version currently in force was adopted just four years ago.\nWe also offer reduced fines for companies willing to cooperate in our investigations, for example, when they draw our attention to the existence of a cartel, and also for companies agreeing to reach a settlement with the Commission. This saves a great deal of time and resources for all parties. In any event, companies cannot be forced to shell out more than 10% of their total annual turnover, which is the ceiling for the level of fines that can be imposed.\nFines, therefore, honourable Members, are our primary tool. However, the introduction of sanctions for individuals should not be ruled out in the future, in particular, administrative sanctions. A number of Member States actually authorise such sanctions. We want to look closely at the legal and political implications of this kind of development.\nIs there a need for a formal legal framework? Article 23 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 p", "Community action on the provision of cross-border health care (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on Community action on the provision of cross-border health care, by Karl-Heinz Florenz, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety B6-0013/2007).\nJohn Bowis \ndeputising for the author. - Mr President, I very much welcome this debate and the progress that is going to be made following the ECJ judgments, and I know that the Commission has this in its sights.\nWhen I was in Potsdam in January for the German Presidency's first health conference, I very much welcomed the German Government's encouragement and its determination to see progress on the issue of patient mobility. We now look forward to the Commission taking that ship into the seas and bringing it safely to harbour for the benefit of our citizens.\nIn Potsdam, I quoted Jean Giraudoux, because we have a problem, and his quotation, I thought, symbolised it. He said '\nJamais po\u00e8te n'a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 la nature aussi librement qu'un juriste la r\u00e9alit\u00e9'.\nMr President, no poet ever interpreted nature as freely as a lawyer interprets the truth. And, with apologies to any lawyers who may be listening, it is a fact that the lawyers of Europe are deciding policy on patient mobility. Why? Because the politicians of Europe have failed to do so.\nIf you are happy with unelected lawyers deciding national and European Union health policy, then you do not need to do anything. Just wait and the bills will come in. But if, like me, you believe that it should be the job of parliamentarians, then we need to get on and give legal certainty and guidance without further delay in this whole area for patients.\nBut we need not panic. We are not talking about vast numbers. Most of our citizens prefer local options and, of course, language may be a deterrent to travelling very far. Only if we have waited too long are most of us interested in cross-border healthcare", "20. European conscience and totalitarianism (vote) \nPresident\nI would like to bring to your attention the fact that Mr Nassauer and Mr Sz\u00e1jer have signed the joint motion for a resolution on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.\n- Before the vote on paragraph 3:\nVytautas Landsbergis\nMr President, let me recall our significant resolution of 2005 about the end of the Second World War in Europe, which stated that 'there cannot be reconciliation without truth and remembrance'.\nI would not like to delete the truth now. Please agree that 'truth' be inserted: reconciliation with truth and remembrance. Please vote for truth.\nVytautas Landsbergis\nMr President, the text refers to crimes against humanity that were still happening 'as late as July 1995'. It would be better to say 'were still taking place in July 1995', because nobody can be sure that there were no more such crimes in 1996.\n(Interjection from the floor)\nYes, indeed - that would be softer; 'took place as late as' should be replaced with 'were still taking place in'.\nTunne Kelam\nMr President, this is a minor correction. The text now reads 'whereas the Central European countries had the added experience of Communism'. I would like to change 'Central European countries' to 'Central and Eastern European countries', because everywhere else the text reads this way, and to replace 'had the added experience of Communism' with 'have experienced both Communism and Nazism', because, to Eastern European nations, nothing was 'added' by Communism: most of them had Communism first, then Nazism, and then Communism again.\nBogus\u0142aw Sonik\n(PL) Mr President, I would just like to add that I also signed the resolution.\n(FR) Mr President, I also signed this resolution and I do not see my name on the motion for a resolution. I would therefore ask you to add my name.\n", "6. Trade and economic relations with Turkey (\nDimitar Stoyanov\n(BG) Mr President, I am taking the floor on the basis of Rule 175(2) of the Rules of Procedure and I am asking for this report to be referred back to committee.\nMy reasons for this are as follows. There is a conflict of interest for the rapporteur, Mr Kazak, as he completed his higher education at the Sorbonne at the expense of the Turkish Government. Given this situation, I think that the report he has drafted is not impartial and must be referred back to committee and a new rapporteur appointed to draft a report which will be impartial and accurate.\nThis is why I am appealing to my fellow Members to support me on this request to refer the motion back to committee.\nPresident\nThank you. A request of this kind may only be submitted by a political group. In this case, the request is not appropriate. We cannot consider it.\nBefore the vote on Amendment 2, part 2:\nDimitar Stoyanov\n(BG) Mr President, point 2 states: 'Referral back to committee may also be requested by a political group or at least 40 Members'. Please ask to see whether my proposal is supported by 40 MEPs and then we will find out whether we can continue further with the report.\n", "Question Time (Council) \nPresident\nThe next item is questions to the Council (B6-0382/2007).\nThe following questions were presented.\nSubject: 'Revolving door' immigration policy\nSome political figures and specialists have raised the possibility of achieving an agreement between the Member States which would combine the monitoring of the Union's external borders with a new 'revolving door' immigration policy to allow legally established immigrants in the Union to return to their countries of origin without fear of encountering a closed door when returning to the EU.\nDoes the Council consider this approach feasible, and would it be possible to set up this policy using straightforward intergovernmental cooperation, or would it be necessary to establish new institutional mechanisms to achieve this end?\nManuel Lobo Antunes\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) As the honourable Member will know, in May 2007 the Commission presented to the European Parliament, to the Council and to the Committee of the Regions a communication on circular migration and mobility partnerships between the European Union and third countries. In its communication the Commission considers circular migration to be a useful means to be developed at Community level to ensure more effective management of migration flows. In the June 2007 conclusions on extending and enhancing the global approach to migration, the Council in turn stressed that legal migration opportunities, including well-managed circular migration, could potentially benefit all partners involved.\nThe Council believes that all well-managed circular migration opportunities should therefore be explored in close cooperation with all the relevant parties, with a view to the adoption of Council Conclusions not later than the end of 2007. The need to examine these circular migration opportunities, based on the Communication from the Commission of 16 May 2007, was also reiterated in the conclusions of the June 2007 European Council. Th", "Arrangements for importing fishery and aquaculture products into the EU with a view to the future reform of the CFP (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Alain Cadec, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on arrangements for importing fishery and aquaculture products into the EU with a view to the future reform of the CFP.\nAlain Cadec\nMr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, one of the strong ideas of this report is the need to establish a vital link between the common commercial policy and the common fisheries policy.\nWith this in mind, we can only welcome the fact that the Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, Mrs Damanaki, who is our regular contact, and the Commissioner for Trade, Mr De Gucht, are reunited on the Commission's bench. Two Commissioners for one report, what an honour! I must say that this dual representation of the Commission is surprising and flattering, and moreover, rather unusual.\nLet us return to the report itself. Imports of fishery and aquaculture products from third countries account for more than 60% of EU consumption. This worrying level of EU dependence on imports is the result of a double phenomenon: firstly, there has been a decline in EU production, and, secondly, the EU market has been increasingly opened up to imports, as a result of the trade policies conducted by the Commission in the course of the last decade.\nThese developments are making life difficult for EU fishermen who, paradoxically, are finding it hard to sell their catches at sufficiently lucrative prices, even though demand exceeds supply for most species. European fishermen accept having environmental, social and health restrictions imposed on them, but bitterly resent the fact that they are not applied in the same way to products imported in huge numbers from third countries.\nWhat is at stake here is quite simply the survival of an economically viable European fisheries sector, a supplier of jobs right across the industry, a provid", "Policy coherence for development and the effects of the EU's exploitation of certain biological natural resources on development in West Africa (debate) \nPresident\nThe next and last item is the debate on the report by Frithjof Schmidt, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on policy coherence for development and the effects of the EU's exploitation of certain biological natural resources on development in West Africa (INI/2007/2183).\nFrithjof Schmidt\nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by translating the title of my report. When we speak of 'biological natural resources', we are referring to timber and fish. Timber and fish are the key resources for the social and economic development of the West African region. It follows that we are also speaking of deforestation.\nWe all know how alarming this development is. Of the forestry that existed in West Africa fifty years ago, only about 13% is still standing today. This means that 87% of the land that was once afforested has already been cleared. We all know what impact this has on climatic trends and the desertification process.\nWe have equally alarming statistics on overfishing in that area of the Atlantic and the grave problems it is creating. We are all familiar, of course, with the images of overloaded canoes landing on the Canary Islands with cargos of migrants from West Africa. The connection between the trends I have described and the increased migration to the European Union from West Africa is obvious and incontrovertible and is also a subject of political debate, of course, within our societies.\nThe European Union is the main market for timber and fish. We ourselves say that we buy some 80% of these products. For this reason, it is prudent, and indeed essential, to review the coherence of our development policy, our fisheries policy and our policy on trade in timber in order to establish the extent to which they interact fruitfully or whether their aims may al", "\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 26 May 2005. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 15 years ago, the European Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize to the Burmese opposition leader, Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi. In a few days time, she will reach her 60th birthday, that is to say, 15 years will have passed four times, but she is still under arrest. She is the only Sakharov Prize winner who has not been able to receive her prize after more than 3\u00a0500 days in captivity. I felt I should point this out, because it may have been forgotten.\nIt may also have been forgotten that, in 1990, her party, the National League for Democracy, received 80% of the votes in the parliamentary elections, 80%, but it could not take power because of the Burmese military regime. And, despite the frequent and constant appeals from this Parliament, despite the European Union\u2019s sanctions, despite the condemnation of several bodies of the United Nations, the Burmese regime is continuing its campaign of ethnic cleansing and systematic abuse of human rights. Human Rights Watch recently accused that regime of the systematic violation of human rights, torture and executions.\nI therefore believe it appropriate, on behalf of this Parliament, for us all to renew our call for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and her fellow political prisoners and express our complete condemnation of the abuses of the Burmese regime.\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The final version of the draft agenda for the June part-session as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Wednesday 2 June pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.

I would first like to give the floor to Commissioner De Gucht on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Ashton.\nKarel De Gucht\nMr President, I have great pleasure this evening in debating the situation in Ukraine on behalf of Cathy Ashton, High Representative and Vice-President, who regrets her absence here today.\nToday marks an important day for Ukraine with its OSCE Chairmanship for 2013 having been declared this morning. It is a privilege, but also a responsibility and it will give Ukraine the opportunity to live up to expectations, which are certainly high.\nI want to dwell now on our bilateral relations, marked last Monday by a summit at the Ch\u00e2teau Val Duchesse in Brussels, attended by President Yanukovych, as well as by Presidents Van Rompuy and Barroso. Cathy Ashton took part in the discussion on international issues. I was also there to take stock of the prospects for establishing, in the near future, a deep and comprehensive free trade area with a high level of ambition. Our discussions were sincere, and I am confident that the summit has put a relationship that deserves to be more extensive and more tangible on the right track.\nThe two most important outcomes of the summit are the adoption of the action plan on the free movement of persons and the signing of the protocol to the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement enabling Ukraine to take part in EU programmes.\nOther items on the agenda were the internal situation in Ukraine, current negotiations on the future Association Agreement and the reform process. Ukraine is part of our neighbourhood. We are therefore trying to embrace its proximity, and Ukraine's neighbourhood is not standing still, either, ", "Development of the Community's railways  Certification of train drivers operating locomotives and trains on the railway system in the Community  International rail passengers' rights and obligations (continuation of debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the continuation of the joint debate on European railways.\nAt this moment when for the first time I am exercising my duty to preside over the European Parliament, I would like to acknowledge all of those people who have accompanied me until this point in my life and career, my party colleagues and the citizens of my province, Ciudad Real, in Spain, who kept me in my country's Parliament for twenty-two years. In particular, it is a happy historical coincidence that we should be talking about railways when I come from a town called Alc\u00e1zar de San Juan, which was a central point in the history of the railways and in the history of the workers' movement in my country.\nSepp Kusstatscher\n- (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am essentially in favour of the third railway package. Originally, I took the view that the State should never hand over operation of the railways to private companies, but, provided the infrastructure remains under State ownership, and local, regional and cross-border transport services are transferred to private companies only under very clear conditions, in a socially and environmentally responsible way, I now think that we must accept fair competition. If, however, a State monopoly were simply to be replaced by a number of private monopolies, as has sometimes been the case with the energy companies, then liberalisation would certainly get us nowhere.\nMy experience as a frequent rail traveller has shown me that the quality of railway provision depends not on the level of privatisation, but rather on a clear political will to give rail preference over road. What counts in this respect are the true costs and the attractiveness of the railways in general, including, for example, appealing stations", "Situation of civil society and national minorities in Belarus (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the statement by the Council and the Commission on the situation of civil society and national minorities in Belarus.\nDiego L\u00f3pez Garrido\nThank you, Mr President, for giving me the opportunity to speak on this item regarding the situation of civil society and national minorities in Belarus.\nThe European Union is certainly very concerned about the deterioration of the situation in Belarus, especially with regard to human rights.\nThe lack of freedom of expression and assembly, the constantly increasing pressure on the media, the laws restricting the use of the Internet and the actions against opposition activists are causing the human rights situation in Belarus to deteriorate and worsen.\nIn her statement on 16 February, last month, Mrs Ashton, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, also expressed her concern regarding the situation of the Polish minority in Belarus, and regarding the detention by the police of some members of that minority. This statement, this formal position of the High Representative, was also sent to the authorities in Belarus through official diplomatic channels.\nOn Monday, we were able to discuss this matter in the Foreign Affairs Council, and we were able to have a thorough debate that I am sure will be repeated in future. There was, incidentally, a speech made by the Polish Minister, who expressed his concern and his feeling that there was a need to react and to take a position regarding the systematic harassment of members of the Polish minority. It must also be said that the different facets of the European Union are, without a shadow of a doubt, very concerned, and are monitoring this situation very directly and very closely.\nI think it is very important to convey to the authorities in Belarus that they must comply with the commitments that they have made in the OSCE to respect human rights", "10.

The BBC this morning reported that a British Member of this House, holding a senior position within his delegation, continues to offer strategic advice to private clients, but does not state in the Register of Interests who these clients are. The people of Europe have a right to expect their representatives to keep the public interest separate from private profit, but they can only be sure that this is being done in all cases if the information is both publicly available and easily accessible.\nMadam President, since these matters are currently being considered by the Quaestors, may I ask you to use your influence both to ensure that the Register of Interests is brought up to date and modified to cover instances of this kind and, above all, to ensure that the Register is not only available for inspection by this House, but is also published on the Internet?\n\nPresident\nThank you, Mr Davies. I shall look into this matter with the College of Quaestors.\n\nTaylor\nMadam President, on a point of order.

In the words of our Berlin Declaration of 25 March 2007, 'We, the citizens of the European Union, have united for the better'.\n(Applause)\nThe successful integration of Members from Member States joining the European Union in 2004 and 2007 and the adaptation of our parliamentary work to a European Parliament now bigger and more diverse rank among the most significant successes of this parliamentary term.\nWe, the 785 Members of Parliament, have learned ", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nPresident\nWe will now proceed to today's explanations of vote. I am sure this will provoke strong feelings among you, but there are very many Members who have put their names down to speak, and I believe they are present.\nInese Vaidere\n(LV) Mr President, it was not really clear on which report I could speak now. I gave notice to speak on the report by Mrs Stauner, Mr Maldeikis and Mr Corbett. Yes, I would like to say something. It is just that I did not react immediately.\nMr President, with this EUR 5 billion package, the majority of which has been directed towards rural development, I would particularly like to emphasise the fact that it is very important to look not only at official indicators, but also at the real needs of rural development. Broadband is necessary in all the Member States, but there are Member States, such as my own, where improvements to road infrastructure as well as other measures to preserve the rural landscape are needed. I urge you to look more in the direction of convergence policy and cohesion policy, and to provide more support to those Member States that have fallen into economic difficulties and which are, perhaps, at a lower level of economic development than the older Member States. Thank you.\nZita Ple\u0161tinsk\u00e1\n- (SK) The Stavreva report is one of three reports incorporated into the EUR 5 billion combined package. In the context of the economic crisis we can see that we are lacking the funds for investing in projects in the energy sector and rural development, which have suffered the worst effects of the economic crisis. I welcome the fact that the European Parliament has passed the proposed regulation within the framework of the European economic recovery plan, which allocates EUR 1.5 billion for all Member States through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development.\nRural areas can implement projects aimed at developing broadband Internet links.

Those three legs - energy policy, climate policy and energy security - must function together.\nFrom my perspective this highlights the importance of nuclear power. It is important that the existing nuclear power plants are managed in as safe and secure a way as possible, but it is also important that we have clear rules to ensure that the future power plants of the European Union are as secure and safe as possible.\nThis is not only a matter of preparing the ground for more nuclear power. I think that there is rather large support for such a policy in the European Union, that it is growing and that we need to live up to the responsibilities that this gives us all. I respect those who are hesitant about or are against the use of nuclear power, but whatever opinion and whatever view we have on nuclear power, there can be no disagreement on the need for the rules to be as safe and secure as possible for the nuclear power we have.\nIt is from this perspective that I would like to present this report on the Community framework for nuclear safety. There is a legal basis for this and there has been a debate in committee on whether all the procedures have been fulfilled. A letter has been sent from the Committee on Legal Affairs to the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy saying that if it is a new proposal then there is a need for a new opinion from the group of experts. My view, and the view of the majority o", "3. Afghan journalist Perwiz Kambakhsh - The case of the Iranian citizen Seyed Mehdi Kazemi\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution on the case of the journalist Perwiz Kambakhsh and the debate on four motions for a resolution on the case of the Iranian citizen Seyed Mehdi Kazemi.\nNickolay Mladenov\nauthor. - Mr President, I will link this discussion to the previous debate on Russia because I strongly believe that, if we believe in a core set of values, we cannot uphold them only in countries that are weak, and give countries that are strong an exemption.\nI am proud that this Parliament debated the resolution on Russia, and we should all be proud of that. We should fear the day when the European Parliament stops debating these resolutions and stops standing firmly for the values that we believe in.\nBecause, today, democracy is not the right of everyone to be equal, it is the equal right of everyone to be different. This is a core message that we need to pass on to our partners in Russia, and we need to pass it to our partners in Afghanistan.\nPresident Karzai and the Afghan Government have committed themselves to building a democratic, modern state. In a democratic and modern state, the death sentence is unacceptable. There is not debate about that. No form of death punishment is acceptable in a democratic and modern state. This is the core of our European value.\nThe case of the Afghan journalist Mr Kambakhsh is even more perplexing, because he has been sentenced to death because of exercising his right to free access to information.\nWe should encourage very strongly the authorities in Afghanistan, the Government and the President to intervene on his behalf and use their powers to spare his life and to make sure that he is pardoned at the end of the process which he needs to go through now, meaning the appeal process.\nWe should, however, also continue to help the authorities build the institutions that they need to function as a democratic", "Bilateral agreements between Member States and third countries concerning sectoral matters and covering applicable law in contractual and non-contractual obligations - Bilateral agreements between Member States and third countries on judgments and decisions in matrimonial matters, parental responsibility and maintenance obligations - Development of an EU criminal justice area (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on\nthe report by Tadeusz Zwiefka, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on bilateral agreements between Member States and third countries concerning sectoral matters and covering applicable law in contractual and non-contractual obligations, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a procedure for the negotiation and conclusion of bilateral agreements between Member States and third countries concerning sectoral matters and covering applicable law in contractual and non-contractual obligations - C6-0001/2009 -\nthe report by G\u00e9rard Deprez, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on bilateral agreements between Member States and third countries on judgments and decisions in matrimonial matters, parental responsibility and maintenance obligations, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a procedure for the negotiation and conclusion of bilateral agreements between Member States and third countries concerning sectoral matters and covering jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments and decisions in matrimonial matters, parental responsibility and maintenance obligations, and applicable law in matters relating to maintenance obligations - C6-0035/2009 -, and\nthe report by Maria Grazia Pagano, on behalf of Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on development of an EU criminal justice area, with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on development of an EU criminal justice area.\nTadeusz Z", "13. Increase in energy prices (vote) \nPresident\nThat concludes voting time.\nTatjana \u017ddanoka\nMr President, on a point of order, at the beginning of voting time we voted on two Esteves reports: the first on readmission, without a roll-call vote, and the second on short-stay visas, with a roll-call vote. However, you announced the same title both times: 'the report on readmission'.\nAs a result, there was some confusion in the vote by the Verts/ALE Group. I would like to ask the Secretariat and the President to check our vote. Our group's position was in favour of the report on short-stay visas and against the report on readmission. I am afraid that the whole group has voted otherwise because of the mistake made in the announcement of the title of the report. Please take this into account.\nPresident\nIf this was the case, Mrs \u017ddanoka, it will be noted. We shall look into it and make the appropriate note in the Minutes.\n", "Decision on urgent procedure\nProposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 as regards the date of introduction of electronic identification for ovine and caprine animals - C6-0448/2007 -\nFriedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf\n(DE) Mr President, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development discussed this yesterday evening and voted in favour of urgent procedure. I therefore commend its decision to the House.\n(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)\n", "\nAndrews\nI find it entirely objectionable that the Greens demonstrated noisily in this House yesterday about East Timor. It seems to me that they are insensitive to the reality of how this House feels about the issue of East Timor, and I wish and I hope that you will insist on people not doing that kind of thing in the future. I might remind the Greens that the German Greens are the least interested in the issue of East Timor. I do not want to make a political statement, but the idea of demonstrating as they did yesterday I find disgusting, to say the very least.\n\n\nPresident\n Ladies and gentlemen, we have had some slight technical problems regarding the Minutes for yesterday' s sitting. Apparently, not all Members have received a copy. In this situation, given that a number of Members have not been able to obtain the Minutes, I do not think that I can ask you to approve the Minutes. This is one of the things that we are going to improve gradually in order to prevent a recurrence of this type of incident.\nSo, we will approve the Minutes for both today' s sitting and yesterday' s sitting tomorrow morning. However, we still have one problem. You will recall that we had tabled a vote for this morning on the interpretation of the Rules of Procedure proposed by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs regarding the Technical Group of Independent Members, a mixed group.\nI will now turn to the representatives of this group. If Mr Dell' Alba thinks that, considering the absence of the Minutes, we should postpone this vote too, then this is what I shall do. That would be quite in order. On the other hand, if he thinks that we can proceed to the vote, then I shall give an explanation of the case so that all Members are properly informed.\n\nDell' Alba\nMrs Fontaine, since it is an Appendix to the Minutes, it would be appropriate, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, to vote tomorrow morning, at the same time as the Minutes, if you wish.\n\nPresident\n Mr Dell' Alba, that would ", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe minutes of yesterday's session have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nWijsenbeek\nMadam President, on page six of the Minutes of yesterday's sitting, three reports are listed under what is referred to as the 'Hughes procedure' . I would prefer in future for the correct rule from the Rules of Procedure to be quoted, instead of using the name of some random Member.\n\nPresident\nWe have actually finished with the approval of the Minutes, but I shall pass on the suggestion that we could perhaps add something to the expression 'Hughes procedure' , in order to make it clear to those Members who do not understand what is meant by that expression.\n(The Minutes were approved)\n\nSmith\nMadam President. I just wish to inform the House that tomorrow morning in Liverpool a commemorative service will be held for our late colleague Ken Stewart. The President's Office has very kindly agreed to send a letter of condolence. I want to record my thanks to the President for that.\nGiven that the Commission is here, I also wish to mention that last week the Commission issued a press release supporting an expedition to investigate the wreck of the bulk carrier Derbyshire , which vanished in the Pacific in 1980. This was an issue which Ken Stewart fought long and hard for in his years in this Parliament and he would be most pleased that the Commission is investigating this. Indeed, as we all know, he fought very hard on all issues of maritime transport, for the safety of those who earn their living and the passengers who sail on the ships. So we are pleased to record that the Commission supports the expedition. Ken would be pleased.\n\nPresident\nThank you for this information.\n\nHallam\nMadam President, on a point of order.

It is a brilliant idea and an excellent report, and Parliament stands united in support of its implementation.\nI hope we will have electronic company registers in the Member States as soon as possible, as well as a Europe-wide electronic platform that contains all information companies are required to disclose. The proposals, if implemented, would mean less bureaucracy, more transparency, a diminished administrative burden, lower costs for companies and, as a result, enhanced competitiveness of European companies.\nLaima Liucija Andrikien\n(LT) I voted for the report on the Regulation of European Statistics prepared by Andreas Schwab. The reason I voted for it is the fact that the content of the new regulation is really important, significantly improving the existing regulation. I have in mind the definition of the European Statistical System, its place in Community law. The regulation also sets out the functions of national statistics institutions in the European Statistical System in solving matters of statistical confidentiality and statistical quality. This is undoubtedly a step forward compared to the current situation and the regulation now in force.\nIn fact, the European Commission's proposal to split the European Statistical System Committee into two parts seems controversial to me and the rapporteur's position of not separating functions seems more acceptable and worth supporting. However, I trust that, in future, if the European Parliament, Council and Commission work together, we will overcome these disagreements.\nAlbert De\u00df\n(DE) Mr President, I have an explanation of vote to make on the report in respect of modulation. In the most recent agricultural reform, it was decided that farmers would have planning certainty until 2013. For that reason, I was opposed to impleme", "Antibiotic resistance (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on antibiotic resistance, by Paolo De Castro, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development - B7-0304/2011).\nPaolo De Castro\nMadam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we have an important chance to tackle the growing problem of antibiotic resistance in animals responsibly and with commitment. This is a strategic issue for the agriculture sector and, in particular, for the future of the European animal husbandry system.\nThe data show that around 50% of the antibiotics in Europe are prescribed for animal use. If used properly, antibiotics are a useful tool that helps farmers keep their livestock healthy and productive and safeguard its welfare. Therefore, we are not here to demonise antibiotic use in animal husbandry, but we want to ask the Commission to provide a concrete response for the more efficient and effective use of antibiotics, in order to reduce resistance in animals.\nIn our resolution of 5 May 2010 on the EU Action Plan for Animal Welfare, this House underlined the link between animal welfare, animal health and public health, and urged the Commission and the Member States to address the difficult problem of antibiotic resistance in animals in a responsible manner. In particular, we called on the Commission to collect and analyse data on the use of all animal health products, including antibiotics, with a view to ensuring the effective use of such products. A year later, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour to chair, is here to ask the Commission to implement all relevant initiatives to resolve this long-standing problem, which can also have consequences for human health.\nWhat is needed, Madam President and Commissioner, is a tangible commitment from the Commission that it will use the data collected to put the results obtained into practice, not only encouraging research and m", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nJanssen van Raay\nMr President, I just wanted to say that the Minutes are excellent with regard to my comment and that I hope that you ask the President to put my comment into action. The Minutes are correct but I would request President H\u00e4nsch to act upon my point.\n\nPresident\nI am not sure if that remark was ironic but I will take it at face value. I will pass your comment on to President H\u00e4nsch.\n\nJanssen van Raay\nIt was not meant ironically.

We have known since last week that there was very little on the agenda today. Why then can the people planning the work not be so flexible as to give us better speaking times? I would gladly listen to Mr Brok, Mr van Nistelrooij, Mr Surj\u00e1n and others for five or ten minutes to allow them to make a substantial contribution. That would make sense. Thus, I would make an earnest plea. Many of my fellow Members would have gladly spoken today if a more sensible and flexible approach had been taken.\nPresident\nI take that comment very seriously. I have Mr Rou\u010dek with me, who will now chair the discussion, and will certainly be able to add time to your speech as necessary. Maybe not five minutes if the time allocated is two minutes, but let us say that we can exceed the time of the speech by 50%. This is a lot. If someone has been allocated two minutes, they will now have three minutes. This is a big change.\nRichard Seeber\n(DE) Mr President, we know that you are a good President. Nevertheless, I would ask you to stick to the set timetable. I have a group of visitors, but I would like to speak during catch-the-eye. If you now allow Mr Posselt, Mr Brok and Mr van Nistelrooij to speak for five minutes then I will not be able to do that. Perhaps they could speak after the catch-the-eye procedure, as all MEPs have a particular timetable and we have to plan our day.\nPresident\nThat is correct, you are right, but in individual cases and at special request, we will extend the time somewhat. I would like to ask Commissioner \u0160tefan F\u00fcle to begin our discussion.

One example of these threats: in paragraph 10 the report stresses a need for a major EU contribution to promote regional disarmament.\nI would like to draw attention to the Kaliningrad area, a heavily militarised Russian enclave within the EU. To continue pretending that this last vestige of the Cold War and Soviet expansion is something with which we have to accommodate would be dangerous and absurd. Therefore the demilitarisation of this area, which should be followed by making Kaliningrad a pilot project and opening it up to free trade, should be one of the topics to be raised at the forthcoming EU-Russia Summit. The von Wogau report clearly presents our final objective. We are on our way to a Security and Defence Union. However, it also reminds us that the EU is still a long way from this goal. We are just noting progress, increasing capacities and looking for additional money.\nThere are some problems we need to be very clear about. We need to establish a common market in the field of defence, to provide for a European budget to cover both the military and the civil aspects of security and to intensify cooperation between the EU Defence Ministers, with the final goal of creating the post of Deputy EU Foreign Minister in charge of the ESDP. To that end, it is essential to avoid duplication of efforts and to coordinate all these activities with NATO. There is an urgent need to provide the same access to space-based intelligence systems for all Member States on a common basis.\nLibor Ro", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nGarc\u00eda Arias\nMr President, yesterday there was an unfortunate accident in Asturias, Spain, which caused the death of a miner. I raise this matter here because the stoppages and strikes in the Asturian mining industry may get worse, because tension is rising.\nThe European Union is involved in this, because the underlying problem in the conflict is that the European Commission has not accepted the plan which had already been negotiated between the Spanish Government and the unions. Mr President, would you please ask the Commission to give very careful thought to what is happening in Spain, because I fear tension is rising.\nI would like our sympathy to be expressed, and also a call to the Spanish mining unions and Government to remain calm. However, the Commission must realize that it has to respect what has already been agreed between the unions and the Spanish Government. Otherwise, because of the geographical distance between Brussels and the areas in question, it will seem as if the Commission is hiding behind an authoritarian attitude.\n\nPresident\nMrs Garcia Arias, we read about this distressing incident in the newspapers today. I have made a note of your comments.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez \u00c1lvarez\nMr President, to be brief I will just say that I completely agree with what Mrs Garc\u00eda Arias just said. Those of us who live in Asturias are very concerned about the Commission's attitude to the mining plan signed by the Spanish Government and the unions in Asturias. When you pass on our condolences, could you please also tell the European Commission how worried we are about what is happening. The conflict may get worse, and who knows what that might lead to.\n\nMcMahon\nMr President, concerning the Minutes, page 15, the issue raised by Mr de Vries and Mr Martens.

(B7-0013/2010; B7-0014/2010; B7-0202/2010; B7-0203/2010).\nMonika Fla\u0161\u00edkov\u00e1 Be\u0148ov\u00e1\nAll parliamentary questions submitted to the Commission and to the Council on the occasion of the forthcoming European summit on Roma are linked by several common denominators.\nThe first is dissatisfaction with the current situation of most Roma in the European Union. This issue is also closely related to dissatisfaction with spending or the level of spending pre-accession and structural funds for the purpose of integrating Roma into the rest of the society, as well as their social rehabilitation. Another important point is the role of civil society, including Roma organisations, to engage in problem solving.\nBoth points are important, but I would like to suggest that it is very important how these problems are going to be solved. Let us be honest with ourselves - after many years of vague political declarations and inactivity, several of us feel an acute need to finally move towards concrete action. I am an uncompromising advocate of human rights and all my statements on the floor of the European Parliament during the past six years have always been in this context. In these six years, I have also listened to several discussions about discrimination against ethnic Roma and the need for solutions to ethnic Roma problems. Despite this abundant debate, we have not been able to take any substantial steps towards concrete solution and I believe this is mainly due to us formally focusing on the technical term discrimination and not addressing the real reasons which are the cause of the current situation, in which our fellow Roma citizens live.\nTherefore, if we really want to address the Roma problem, we will have to focus primarily on compliance with both international treaties on domestic law, as well as on international conventions. I", "Revised Hungarian constitution (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on the revised Hungarian constitution.\nEnik\u0151 Gy\u0151ri\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, the Treaty has not conferred any power on the Council to deal with national constitutions of the Member States. Under Article 4(1) and (2) of the Treaty on the European Union, the adoption of a constitution remains in the exclusive competence of the Member State concerned. Therefore, the Council has not been in a position to discuss the newly adopted constitution of Hungary.\nViviane Reding\nVice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, at President Barroso's request, I am addressing the House here today on the subject of the Hungarian constitution.\nAt the outset, President Barroso stressed on various occasions that the Commission does not make political judgments on the fundamental constitutional and institutional choices of a Member State. The adoption of a new constitution in a Member State is a matter for its people, for its institutions in accordance with the applicable national law and, where relevant, Union and international law.\nThe Commission may, however, assess the constitution - as it may any other legal act of a Member State - from the perspective of its compliance with Union law. It goes without saying that the constitution of every Member State should reflect and comply with the European values of freedom, democracy, equality, rule of law, human dignity and respect of human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities, without discrimination, as laid down in Article 2 of the Treaty.\nThe new Hungarian constitution will enter into force on 1 January 2012 and will require the adoption of implementing measures. Therefore, at this stage, the Commission can only make a preliminary analysis, as the precise view on the interaction of the constitution with Union law and its legal effects can onl", "Situation in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the situation in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.\nCatherine Ashton\nVice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Madam President, the situation in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire is very precarious, as lives are at risk - the lives of Ivorian citizens but also of many Europeans who are living and working in the country.\nI believe important issues are at stake, not only the role which C\u00f4te d'Ivoire plays in Africa, but also the vast work done by the international community over the past 10 years to support crisis resolution and enhance stability. Presidential elections have been due for several years. In the end, it is a credit to the Ivorian people, to the work of the United Nations with the support of the international community and, in particular I must say, to the European Union and the facilitator, President Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso, that these elections could finally take place.\nAll candidates had agreed beforehand the ground rules of the election. These included a special role for the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative, Mr Choi, in certifying the election results. A European electoral observation mission was sent to the country headed by Mr Cristian Preda, MEP. I thank him for his work and I believe he will be speaking shortly. It concluded that the elections were held in democratic conditions. I do thank and congratulate Mr Preda and his team for their courage as well as their excellent work, carried out in difficult circumstances.\nThe results were proclaimed by the Independent Electoral Commission and certified by the special representative of the UN Secretary-General. President Barroso and I were among the first to congratulate President Ouattara on his victory. The international community has been unanimous in recogni", "Statement by the President (Estonia)\nPresident\nI have been asked to make a brief statement on Estonia, and have been informed that the Group chairmen wish to do likewise once I have finished. That does indeed seem to be so. The Schuman Declaration of 9 May 1950 gave Europe the foundation on which it would be possible to build partnership in peace and freedom between nations that had formerly been at enmity with one another and, when our continent, formerly divided, had grown together, the European Union became the guarantor of peace, freedom and prosperity throughout Europe. We take pride in being able, today, to celebrate Schuman Day together with 27 Member States of the European Union, but 9 May is, for other reasons, a controversial date, as we have seen most recently in the dispute concerning the Soviet soldiers' memorial in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, and it is for that reason that we call to mind our resolution of 12 May 2005, in which this House remarked upon the fact that there were some nations for whom the end of the Second World War meant the dawn of another tyranny, that of the Soviet Union. We remind ourselves that controversies on matters of history must never be an occasion for violence, and we firmly condemn affray and looting.\nThe current President of the Republic of Estonia, Toomas Hendrik Ilves, who was formerly a Member of this House, said the right thing in response to the events outside the Estonian embassy in Moscow, and this was what he had to say about them: 'In Europe, it is not customary to demand the resignation of the democratically elected government of a neighbouring country; in Europe, it is unthinkable that the Convention of Vienna on the protection of diplomatic missions be disregarded'.\nWe call to mind our resolution of 8 June 2005 on the protection of minorities and against discrimination against them, in which we declared, inter alia, that national minorities enrich Europe.

I am voting in favour of this candidate, but I believe that more thought needs to be given to the type of qualifications that Members of the Court of Auditors ought to have.\nSophie Auconie\nI supported the nomination of Hans Gustaf Wessberg as a Member of the Court of Auditors because he has over 30 years of professional experience of high level management in public institutions as well as private enterprises in Sweden. A large part of his career has been devoted to improving conditions for private enterprises in Sweden, as manager in organisations representing industry interests in public life. He also has extensive experience of public service, as both a politician and civil servant. He has served as director general of the Swedish Companies Registration Office, an independent government agency, and as state secretary on several occasions. That is why I am convinced that he has the qualities required for this post.\nMara Bizzotto\nThe curriculum vitae submitted by H.G. Wessberg for his nomination as a member of the Court of Auditors shows skills and experience that are certainly in line with the technical and scientific standards required by the position. In particular, Mr Wessberg's commitment to the private-sector business fabric makes the candidate particularly suited to ensuring the balance between EU law and the specific demands of both the market and the people of Europe. I therefore voted in favour of this proposal for a European Parliament decision.\nNessa Childers\nin writing. - I voted for Sweden's nomination of H.G.

The most recent statistical framework shows a steady increase in requests received from Member States in favour of a fund that operates with a different degree of flexibility.\nThe European Commission has already given a sign of its confidence in the Fund by allocating new resources under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) budget line. This is a sign of pragmatism, which was also reconfirmed by the Committee on Budgets this week. Therefore, Europe's commitment to its citizens has been reconfirmed by Parliament's determination to find room in the 2011 budget, despite its greatly reduced margins, to give substance to this fund.\n", "\nCorbett\nMadam President, you will be aware that the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development is currently meeting in our Brussels building. You may not be aware that there are two representatives of the Burmese military junta taking part in that conference. As you know, the European Union has a common position, supported by this House, not to grant visas to members of the Burmese military junta. Yet here they are in our own building.\nI understand that the Council has waived the ban for this conference, as it felt that this was necessary in view of its obligations to the United Nations. If so, may I call on you, Madam President, to ask the Council or Mr Solana to issue a statement making it absolutely clear that this was an exception and that the visa ban and the common position are still in place.\n\nPresident\n Thank you, Mr Corbett. I will indeed discuss this matter with Mr Solana. I also assume, of course, that Mrs Lindh has listened to you very carefully and that she has taken note of what you said. I do not know whether she wishes to reply. Not at this moment, it would seem. But we heard what you said Mr Corbett, and I, for my part, will take the appropriate steps.\n\nVan Orden\nMadam President, on a point of order. I wish to draw attention to some other rather unwelcome visitors on our premises. Yesterday there was a disgraceful Communist demonstration in the courtyard of the Tower. This is very intimidatory, as far as Members are concerned; it is an intrusion on our parliamentary premises. Could you look into the circumstances of this: where are the limits of this Parliament and what rights do we have to exclude such people from our premises?\n\nPresident\nI will give the floor to Mrs Banotti at once because I think she wishes to reply to your question, for which I thank her.\n\nBanotti\nMadam President, you will be aware that I raised the issue at the Bureau last week about a grossly intimidatory and intrusive demonstration in front of the Parliament in Bruss", "Progress report on the reform of the European schools (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the progress report on the reform of the European Schools, by Katerina Batzeli and Erna Hennicot-Schoepges - B6-0454/2008).\nErna Hennicot-Schoepges\nauthor. - (FR) Madam President, I thank the Commissioner for having agreed to address this question, which was tabled some four months ago. Let me remind you of the responsibilities of the EP Committee on Culture and Education, which, according to Annex VI, Section XV(2) of the Rules of Procedure, include 'promotion of the system of European schools.'\nThose schools give priority to educating the children of Community officials. Those children, classed as category I, make up around 70% of the total, pay no enrolment fees and the Commission contributes about 60% of the funding. Category II children, who make up 5%, and category III, who make up 25%, pay school fees of between EUR 4 000 and 16 000.\nThe 14 existing schools teach nearly 21 000 pupils, from nursery school to baccalaureate level, out of a total of 100 million in the Union of 27, in 14 official languages with an identical curriculum in all the language sections. Compared to the situation of all the other school children in the European Union, these pupils are, therefore, highly privileged.\nIn 2006 the Commission promised to reform the system - a laudable undertaking - with a view to establishing a European education system applicable to all types of school that wished to award the European baccalaureate, based on a common curriculum and, where possible, tuition in the mother tongue.\nThe school in Parma, which is approved by the Board of Governors of the European Schools, will be the first school of its kind to award a European baccalaureate in June 2009. For its part, the Board of Governors of the European Schools undertook an in-depth assessment of the baccalaureate with a view to the ongoing reform.\nA study commissione", "1. Coup in Mauritania (vote) \n- Before the vote:\nColm Burke\nMr President, my apologies for being late for the debate earlier on. This was due to the fact that we were trying to agree the terms of an oral amendment relating to paragraph 8. This is the oral amendment as agreed: 'Notes the announcement of new presidential elections by the junta, but deplores the failure - contrary to the position of the 2005-2007 junta - of a commitment to neutrality; calls on the military in power to commit themselves forthwith to a timetable for the restoration of the democratic institutions, in cooperation with the political forces'.\nIn relation to paragraph 10, there is a typographical correction to be made which was agreed in the discussions. The last line of paragraph 10 should read 'which could lead to the freezing of aid, excluding food and humanitarian assistance'.\n(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)\n", "18.

All of the compromise amendments are in Block 1, which means that all other amendments fall.\nThis regulation will finally enable European political parties to take part in European elections. That might be considered perfectly normal, but it was not normal before. My hope is that this new regulation really will enable the ten families of political parties to inject fresh dynamism into the next European elections in 2009.

I did so because I think ordinary Members need to make their position clear on the allegations that have been made and solutions need to be found to deal with the problems affecting certain parliamentary operating expenses and investment expenditure.\nInitial reactions from all the political groups were extremely favourable. Yesterday, Mr President, you stated that my written declaration was unacceptable, when the only condition laid down by Rule 48 of our Rules of Procedure is that this declaration must fall within the sphere of activities of the European Union. Yet declarations on issues such as a general ban on landmines and other subjects have been ruled acceptable, as you are well aware, Mr President.\nYou pointed out to me that other bodies are responsible for dealing with these questions: the Bureau, the Quaestors, the Committee on Budgetary Control. That is true, Mr President, of any written declaration dealing with the activities of the European Union. My written declaration deals with one of the fundamental activities of the European Union - the way elected Members can use public money. Mr President, I would like to know why you have ruled this written declaration unacceptable? What are you afraid of? Why are your people advising you not even to allow distribution to all Members of a declaration making it possible to deal with an issue which everyone knows is fundamental?\n\nPresident\nMr Fabre-Aubrespy, you are very well aware of the reasons why I think your declaration is unacceptable, because I sent them to you in writing.

The inhabitants of Srebrenica were trusting in the fact that in April 1993, as you will remember, their town had been declared a UN safe area. They were bitterly disappointed when the Serb forces, under the command of General Mladic, took the town in July 1995.\nIn front of the United Nations soldiers, the Muslim men were then separated from their families and the women and children driven from the town. Since then, some 8000 people have been reported missing. They have probably been killed. It is now up to the investigations which are under way to establish the facts of the matter, amid the horrors of the mass graves. The massacre at Srebrenica is one of the most dreadful of the war in Bosnia - sadly, one among many others.\nThe international community cannot rest until the facts of the massacre have been established and those guilty have received the punishment they deserve. We owe that to the victims of Srebrenica and their families. We owe it to justice, which the tribunal in The Hague is seeking to dispense.\nI would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to join me in paying tribute to the victims of the massacre at Srebrenica by observing a minute's silence.\n(The House rose and observed one minute's silence)\n\nSpencer\nMadam President, on a point of order.

In 1991 in Lithuania, an unarmed crowd of several thousand people resisted the aggression of the Soviet army and defended freedom and independence. The bloody events of the night of 13 January stunned Europe and the whole world. Countries, international organisations and individuals reacted to the violence of the occupying forces, sending messages of support to Vilnius. On behalf of all the people of Lithuania, I would like to thank the European Parliament for the resolution adopted on 24 January 1991, supporting the Baltic States, and condemning Soviet aggression. We thank the countries you represent which did not desert us. As a symbol of our thanks, you will find a commemorative publication in your boxes, in memory of those events.

They have not arrived yet.\nI intend to begin by talking about the report in general terms. In the European Parliament we have, on a number of occasions, discussed what policy to conduct in a globalised society. We should not compete for low paid jobs, we should have good working conditions, we should concentrate on human capital, people and investments and other things in order to be successful. We have also discussed on many occasions the balance between open borders and a strongly social EU and concluded that this balance is important.\nIn addition, we have often discussed the issue, and importance, of the equal treatment of people irrespective of gender, ethnic origin or nationality and established that equal treatment and non-discrimination should prevail.\nThe report deals with the need for us to have open borders. The committee is in favour of open borders with no restrictions or transitional periods, but at the same time we should have a social EU where we do not compete with each other by forcing lower wages, poorer working conditions, and so on.\nThe report also deals with the principle of equal treatment, that is to say equal treatment and the absence of discrimination against workers, irrespective of nationality. It must not be the case that people from Latvia, Poland, Germany, Sweden or Denmark are treated differently within the same labour market. This is also the basis for the proposals in the report. The most important proposals relate to the Posting of Workers Directive, as three of the judgments concern posted workers. It is extremely important that we do not turn the Posting of Workers Directive into a minimum directive.\nIt is true that the directive ", "4. Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries (\nBefore the vote on paragraph 16:\nNirj Deva\nMadam President, I would like to include, after 'climate change risk assessment', the words 'which does not harm trade'.\n", "Commemoration and official welcome\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, may I ask you to remember, this morning, the tragic events which shattered the hearts of many Europeans exactly forty years ago this week.\nThe invasion of Hungary by the Warsaw Pact troops, under Soviet command, annihilated one of the most courageous and ambitious attempts to break the totalitarian system. This brutal aggression not only precipitated millions of Europeans into tragedy and oppression, but also confirmed the division of Europe into two blocs. In 1956, Europe seemed condemned to remain a divided continent. Democracy and tyranny stood face to face in the very heart of our continent.\nThis is why I am particularly glad to welcome, at today's sitting, Mr Victor Orban and his colleagues from the Committee on European Affairs of the Hungarian National Assembly.\nFriends from Hungary, you represent your Parliament and your country, a country recently welcomed into the family of democratic nations. Since 1989, the establishment of a new and larger European Union has become the challenge of our generation. This Union will be built on the basis of the achievements of the founding fathers, without calling all their work into question.\nThe events in Hungary in 1956 coincided with the initiatives of Jean Monnet and others, aimed at giving new impetus to the process of European integration. For several decades, no one dared dream that Europe could really regain unity without another world war.\nThe events of 1989 and the peaceful revolutions which took place in Hungary and in other countries have enabled us to realize this dream, without war. All our work towards cooperation with our sister countries in Central and Eastern Europe is therefore not simply another element in Parliament's heavy work programme. It is a fundamental responsibility for us all. To take the historic opportunity we have before us to achieve a peaceful, prosperous and democratic Europe.\nMy friends, may I ask you kindly to observe ", "Impact of the financial crisis on the car industry (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on the impact of the financial crisis on the car industry.\nAlexandr Vondra\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I think that we are now moving into a really important issue. Under the current circumstances, this is something that must be discussed. Once again, we are grateful for this timely opportunity to discuss the effect of the current economic and financial crisis on the automobile industry.\nAs many of you are following very closely in your constituencies, the automobile industry is a key factor for the whole of the European economy. Over the years, we have promoted the competitiveness of the sector by establishing a single European automobile market and calling for fairer competition in trade with third countries. More recently, we have focused on reducing car emissions in order to combat air pollution and climate change. In all these areas this Parliament has given us its consistent support.\nThanks to these efforts, and in particular to the resilience and adaptability of the European automobile industry, European cars are today among the best, the most innovative and the most competitive, as well as the safest, most fuel-efficient and environmentally sustainable in the world. We should be proud of Europe's record.\nNevertheless, despite its resilience, and as a result of factors largely outside its control, the European automotive sector has been particularly badly hit by the global economic crisis. These difficulties were already apparent in November last year, when the Council agreed on an approach based on promoting even more sustainable and fuel-efficient cars, realistic targets for manufacturers, and effective incentives for stimulating demand.\nIn the short time since then, the situation has become more serious. The industry has reported that 8% fewer cars were sold in the Union last year than in the previous year, t", "End-of-life vehicles\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0006/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of the European Parliament and Council Directive on end-of-life vehicles [8095/1/1999 - C5-0180/1999 - 1997/0194(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mr Florenz)\n\nFlorenz\nMr President, nine million cars are shredded and scrapped every year in Europe. Even though they can no longer be driven, these nine million cars may still be traded and moved across borders; and not just intra-Community borders, but also those outside the Union. It is therefore only right that the European Union should draw up Community rules on how these nine million vehicles every year are to be recycled and processed.\nWe believe that the directive has a few weaknesses that we in the House should work on to produce a directive which is genuinely ground-breaking. We therefore have a number of amendments. I personally believe that the scope of the directive goes beyond its objective. I do not think it is necessary for classic cars to be part of the directive. Nor do I think that motorcycles should be included, as the distinctive culture of recycling within the motorcycle industry obviates the need for a European directive in this area.\nI am not looking for such rigidly high recycling quotas when it comes to special-purpose vehicles either. I want special-purpose vehicles such as ambulances to have high recovery quotas. This is my main concern in this matter.\nIn my opinion, the directive solidly regulates the matter of accountability for how a car is disposed of in Europe. This can be left as the Commission has proposed with the Member States ensuring the appropriate collection points for draining cars. This will involve, for example, disposing of more than 32 million lots of used oil, removing break fluid, etc.\nAn important part of this dir", "Statement by the President\nPresident\nIt is with great sadness that we have learned of the dramatic events in Kauhajoki in the west of Finland, where 11 people have lost their lives in a very tragic incident at a school. A number of people were also seriously injured by the perpetrator, who then turned his gun on himself.\nOn behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to express my deepest sympathy and solidarity with the families and all the relatives of the victims. All the victims were innocent young students at a vocational training school, where they were studying for careers in the service sector.\nThis tragedy occurred less than one year after a similar appalling killing spree at Jokela High School. As we all know, Finland is regarded as one of the most peaceful and safest countries in Europe, so we can understand that the people of Finland are speechless with shock, and we share their distress.\nUnfortunately, we often see similar patterns repeated in these acts of bloodshed. In this instance, although the perpetrator posted threatening videos on the Internet before the killing spree, it was not possible to avert the tragedy. As responsible politicians in Europe and in all the Member States, we must do our utmost to ensure that such acts of violence are detected and prevented in time.\nOnce again, on behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to express our deepest sympathy and solidarity with the victims and their families.\n", "Preparation of the informal summit of heads of state and government (Lisbon, 18/19 October 2007) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the preparation of the informal summit of heads of state and government in Lisbon on 18/19 October 2007.\nManuel Lobo Antunes\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, and Mr President, you will understand that, before I refer specifically to the item on the agenda which brought me here today, I should like, on behalf of the Portuguese Government and the Portuguese Presidency of the Council, to thank you for such a warm and friendly tribute - so well deserved in my opinion - which you paid upon the such unexpected and sad loss of my fellow countryman and Member of this Parliament, Dr Fausto Correia.\nPortugal was shocked at the news because it was news on the loss of someone who was a truly good man and who was, for all of us, an example in the fight for human dignity and for the values we believe in: the values of the rule of law and respect for human rights.\nHe is certainly a great loss; we should just try, if we can, to follow his example and I am sincerely grateful for the tribute this Parliament has paid to him, which the Portuguese Government of course reiterates.\n(Applause)\nMargot Wallstr\u00f6m\nVice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, last year I spoke to Parliament about what the Commission saw as the motor of progress in today's European Union and we outlined the so-called 'twin-track' approach - an activist policy agenda and an ambitious approach to the Treaty reform were goals that supported each other. There was a lot of consensus in that debate, and I think there were three reasons for that.\nFirst of all, it reflects a degree of maturity in the European Union, because Europe today touches on so many areas of people's lives, and this has created expectations. Retreating into a lowest-common-denominator Europe would be a big mistake. Second, ", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 16 December 2010.\n(The sitting was opened at 17:00)\n", "Agriculture as a strategic sector in the context of food security (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs S\u00e2rbu, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the recognition of agriculture as a strategic sector in the context of food security.\nDaciana Octavia S\u00e2rbu\nMr President, it is an honour for me to present my report to you, which deals with the strategic importance of agriculture in ensuring the European Union's food security. Agriculture is a neglected topic in the discussions about the European Union's strategy and future. This report will show that Europe has not achieved food security, that farmers and whole rural areas are in danger of disappearing, and that new challenges, such as climate change, are likely to destabilise already dwindling food stocks, not only in Europe, but also worldwide.\nAgainst a background where food production needs to increase by a minimum of 70% by 2050 in order to meet the world population's food demands, food security must be the topic at the heart of the debates conducted at both global and European level. The European Union must respond robustly to these challenges and this report is our attempt to propose today a number of specific courses of action.\nFirst of all, we need a strong common agricultural policy aimed at guaranteeing food security for as many EU citizens as possible and also at helping ensure global food security in the context of limited resources and the impact from climate change. We cannot talk about food security if we do not tackle two crucial issues, specifically: market and price volatility and dwindling global food stocks.\nOn the subject of price volatility, I have called on the Commission, as part of the new CAP, to enhance the role of market intervention instruments and adopt more consistent measures for restricting speculation on agricultural markets. Global food stocks are much more restricted nowadays than in the past. According to estimates, they c", "9.

I therefore request that they be voted on first and that Amendment 89 to Recital 3 is then voted on. I hope that my fellow Members agree and I also ask you to accept that the vote on Amendment 89 to Recital 3 be taken by roll-call vote.\nOthmar Karas\nMadam President, I should like to point out that we made it quite clear in the debate that the amendments are clearly taken into account in the compromise in a sufficiently detailed form.

I learned as early as last Thursday that a ceremony commemorating the victims of terrorism was to be held here this afternoon before this plenary sitting began. I take it as read that it was of an appropriately dignified character, and do not indeed doubt that it was, for I see the occasion, and the need for such a ceremony, as important.\nWhat I am not willing to accept, however, is the way in which this was prepared and staged, and I would also like to tell the Secretary-General, Mr R\u00f8mer, that I intend to energetically follow up what he said in the Conference of Presidents last Thursday, so I will tell the plenary that I, the chairman of my group, had no advance notice of this event whatever. I do not know whether the members or chairmen of other groups were informed of it, but I, in any case, was not. When I, last Thursday, asked the Secretary-General and you how this had been prepared, I was told - for you left the answer to the Secretary-General - that it had been done in close cooperation with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and, that appearing to be to be an acceptable explanation, I declared myself content with it.\nSince then, I have learned that neither the deputy chairman of that committee, Mr Lambrinidis - who is a member of my group - nor my group's coordinator, Mrs Roure, had had any word whatever of this event.\nI think this House has earned the right to be allowed to take part in an event of this kind, and I would have been happy to be present in my capacity as a group chairman. I do not think it helpful that Parliamentary business or initiatives of this kind should be staged in this building without Members of this House being present, and so I ask that, the next time events of this kind - which are, as I have said, useful - are prepared and held, a bet", "Waste crisis in Campania (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on:\nthe oral question to the Commission by Margrete Auken and Eva Lichtenberger, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the waste crisis in Campania - B7-0667/2010),\nthe oral question to the Commission by Bairbre de Br\u00fan and Willy Meyer, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the waste crisis in Campania - B7-0801/2010),\nthe oral question to the Commission by Judith A.

I would like to call for evidence of this to be seen, too. I have high expectations of the response that we are to receive today because, if nothing definite happens now and Italy does not receive a severe fine for this, where necessary, we will come across this problem in many other places. It is not only Italy that has major problems with regard to waste. If everyone has the impression that nothing will happen if they only use landfill sites, we will have a very major disaster on our hands. I am therefore looking forward to the response.\nI would like to use the remainder of my speaking time to address Italy. I am well aware that Italy's government is not directly represented here, but it is nevertheless important for Italy itself to begin to acknowledge that this problem must now be resolved. It is a remarkable country and it is on the brink of drowning in waste. Many conflicts are arising and recently, the situation has only got worse. Italy must not now experience a situation in which yet more burdens are placed on the people in the form of f", "Addressing the challenges of deforestation and forest degradation to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss - Timber and timber products (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on:\nthe Commission statement - Addressing the challenges of deforestation and forest degradation to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss, and\nthe report by Mrs Lucas, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the obligations of operators who place timber and timber products on the market - C6-0373/2008 -.\nStavros Dimas\nMr President, deforestation is responsible for approximately 20% of greenhouse gas emissions at global level. Consequently, from the point of view of climate change, addressing deforestation is an important priority. At the same time, addressing deforestation helps to achieve other important objectives, such as eradicating poverty and reversing the loss of biodiversity, which is another major environmental threat to our planet.\nDeforestation has now become a major issue at international negotiations, on both climate change and biodiversity. In order to promote a policy to address this issue, the European Commission issued a communication in October 2008, which the Council accepted in full last December. This communication refers to the question of deforestation and the deterioration in forests in developing countries and proposes, among other things, the development of a financing mechanism in the aim of providing incentives to maintain existing forests.\nThis proposal is already being discussed and processed at the international negotiations on climate change currently under way. In its communication, the Commission also acknowledges that various European policies, at both internal level and internationally, may have an indirect impact on global forest resources. As such, the Commission has made specific undertakings in the aim", "A special place for children in EU external action (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is a short presentation of the report by Mrs Kinnock, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on a special place for children in EU external action.\nGlenys Kinnock\nrapporteur. - Mr President, I have to say at the outset that I very much welcome the communication which has been prepared by the Commission. I think it is both comprehensive and ambitious.\nIn my report, Commissioner, I recommend which practical actions, investments and processes are needed if we are to identify that very special place for children in external action. The Commission and the Council communication and conclusions on external action will build upon the external dimension of the EU strategy on the rights of the child. I believe that this is essential work for the European Union.\nCommissioner, I now look forward very much to seeing actions intended to match the ambition which I see. We need to see substance backing up the rhetoric. That means that resources must be available and, of course - as I am sure you will agree - there must be no backtracking by the European Union Member States on the commitments they have made to fund the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). What we know is that, for most of the world's two billion children, it is a daily struggle against poverty and vulnerability. As we know, 98% of the children in our world living in extreme poverty are living in developing countries.\nFurthermore, it is now clear that the impact of the financial crisis will be severely felt by children and young people, for instance when the budgets are cut back on health and education. That is why I think it is right that we make a political commitment, at the highest level, on behalf of and with children. The EU must see in its partnership with the developing countries the opportunity to influence public policy to save children's lives.

I would appreciate it if this were corrected.\n\nPresident\nWe take note of how you voted, which will be corrected.\nDue to an error, the proposals of the Conference of Presidents on the appointment of Members of Parliament to bureaux of delegations to joint parliamentary committees do not appear in yesterday' s Minutes and they will, therefore, be included in today' s.\n(The Minutes were approved)   \n\nR\u00fcbig\nMr President, I wish, on the record, to thank France and Belgium for the guard on the buildings having now been markedly stepped up.\n\nPresident\nThank you, Mr R\u00fcbig. We take note of your observation.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez \u00c1lvarez\nMr President, at the last sitting, we were all horrified at the possibility that Safiya Husseini might be executed in Nigeria. I was going to ask for the floor, but Mr Corrie asked for it and I felt that he was representing me when he asked the President to intervene.\nThere is currently a mobilisation in my country, because it appears that the execution has been brought forward to this Saturday. This horrifies us even more, because the case of this woman, like that of many others, is a display of savagery. It is horrendous that a woman is going to be executed for having had a daughter, which is her fifth child, whatever the circumstances of the child' s birth. We should make a final effort to prevent this execution which the authorities have brought forward to this Saturday in an attempt to avoid the international pressure on them not to carry out what I consider to be a murder.\nMr President, I would ask you to make the appropriate representations.\n\nPresident\nMrs Gonz\u00e1lez, the whole House shares your feelings and, as far as our institution is able, we w", "Voting time (continuation) \nHans-Peter Martin\n- (DE) Madam President, the last time that there was such a demonstration of opinion during a visit by a Head of State or Government, the President of this House intervened very strongly. On that occasion it related to a matter that was also of concern to him personally, namely the Treaty of Lisbon. Today, when the President, the sovereign elected President of a country, is speaking and is interrupted and hassled to such an extent by the socialists, the President does nothing. Do you know what this is? This is not democracy, this is despotism. I demand that the appropriate measures be taken.\nAvril Doyle\n- Madam President, it is in my opinion seriously demeaning to the dignity of this House, and indeed to that of the Czech Presidency, that the formal visit of President Klaus should be undermined by allowing the occasion to be used to disseminate materials to influence the outcome of the Lisbon Treaty ratification process. If this is permissible - and I would ask for your ruling on this - the logical conclusion will be a recipe for chaos in our corridors, with those on each side of the argument filling this House in increasing numbers and competitively and aggressively pursuing their points of view. Please ensure that the Bureau does not allow it to happen again.\n(Mixed reactions)\nMartin Schulz\n(DE) Madam President, thank you very much. I suggest that you all listen to what I have to say before you start your shouting.\nA fellow Member, who often recalls things differently, has just spoken. I would like to remind you of the following: when Prime Minister S\u00f3crates wanted to speak here in connection with the signing of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, he was unable to do so by virtue of being shouted down. President Klaus was able to speak here unhindered. That is the difference between us and them. Thank you very much.\n(Applause)\nPresident\nWe now continue with the vote.\n", "Welcome\nPresident\nI am pleased, on behalf of Parliament, to welcome the delegation from Indonesia that is here for the 5th Interparliamentary Meeting between our Parliament and the Parliament of Indonesia. We have been informed that the meeting held this morning was very useful and productive. There is a whole series of matters that are of common interest to both parties, and I would also like to highlight the interest shown in our work by our colleagues from the Indonesian Parliament. We thank you most heartily and wish you a very pleasant stay among us.\n(Applause)\n", "3. Community action programme to promote activities in the field of the protection of the Community's financial interests (Hercule II programme) (vote) \nAfter the vote\nHerbert B\u00f6sch \nMr President, it is not much use me speaking once the vote has happened, so all I want to say is that you need to keep more of an eye out in future. I would like to thank both the German Presidency and its Finnish predecessor. We have wrapped up this topic in just one reading, and we will be spending some EUR 100 million on fighting fraud over the coming years. That is what I wanted to tell the House.\n", "1.

Eastern Chad\nPresident\nThe next item on the agenda are the six motions for a resolution on eastern Chad.\nAdam Bielan  \nauthor. - (PL) Madam President, I would like to say that I am very disturbed by the intensification of fighting in Chad, but also by the lack of progress in finding a political solution to the conflict. I would therefore like to draw particular attention to the role of the EUFOR TCHAD/RCA operation. The main aim of the European initiative, which is also supported by the UN, is to ensure security in the humanitarian zone.\nBearing in mind the ongoing Darfur crisis and the way in which it is destabilising the situation in the region, it is worth remembering here that the conflict has already crossed the borders of Chad and the Central African Republic. I believe it is vital to put neutral forces from the Member States in place as soon as possible. I would like to stress, though, that the success of such a peace mission is heavily dependent on the political efforts that must be made if a successful peace process is to be conducted.\nMary Lou McDonald  \nauthor. - Madam President, I want to make a couple of important and essential points. There is absolutely no doubt that intervention is required in Chad. There is no doubt that the teeming human misery of refugees in that part of our world is unbearable to see, but I want to state very clearly that there are a number of core difficulties with this proposed mission.\nThe first of these is the lack of clarity in terms of the operation's mandate. We are saying that this is a peace-keeping and humanitarian effort. If that is indeed so, then this must be made doubly clear in the terms of reference for the troops we send. I believe that clarity is lacking.\nI do not believe - and I have to disagree with my colleague - that an intervention shaped in this way will actually increase security. We have recently witnessed a growing intensity and barbarity of the conflict. We have also heard from leaders of many of th", "1. Armenia\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on five motions for a resolution on Armenia.\nMarie Anne Isler B\u00e9guin\nauthor. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, will the tragic events that have occurred in Armenia since the presidential election on 19 February 2008 send out the message that Europe is incapable of supporting the fragile little democracies of the South Caucasus in their struggle to become established?\nFollowing the crisis in Georgia, it is now Armenia's turn to suffer major political upheaval. Despite the high level of attention directed at the country during the election campaign, the international community failed to promote the dialogue that might have prevented the clashes on 1 March. After 11 days of protest against the election results by the opposition movement under former head of state Levon Ter-Petrosian, police tried to disperse the demonstrators. The situation degenerated, resulting in the deaths of eight people, injuries to many others and the imposition of a state of emergency with curbs on freedom of information and freedom of assembly, as well as restrictions on political parties. Since then, 400 people have been arrested. There is an evident mood of anxiety among the population, who fear that a policy of repression will be imposed. We have a duty today, in our contacts with all the parties involved in the Armenian conflict, to reflect that fear.\nThe question, however, is what we should propose as a method of bringing all sides to their senses and getting them to the negotiating table against the current backdrop of heightened tension? That is the challenge. We need to restore the confidence of ordinary Armenian men and women in their fledgling democracy. Essential preconditions for restoring confidence are the setting up of an inquiry into the recent events and the release of those imprisoned. The next step - in conjunction with the international community, our Special Representative to the South Caucasus and our", "Welcome\nPresident\nI now have great pleasure in greeting here today a delegation of MPs and other visitors from the New Zealand Parliament and the Mission of New Zealand to the European Union, who are now with us in the distinguished visitors' gallery.\n(Applause)\nThe members of the delegation are in Brussels to meet with their counterparts from the European Parliament at the 14th European Parliament/New Zealand Interparliamentary Meeting. They are leaving Brussels for West Flanders after their meetings this afternoon, where they will attend a number of events tomorrow commemorating the 90th anniversary of the Battle of Passchendaele. I wish the delegation well for the remainder of their stay in the European Union.\n", "Floods in Central European countries, in particular Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by the Commission on the floods in Central European countries, in particular Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary.\nKristalina Georgieva\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, indeed, the floods in Central Europe are a very dramatic reminder of our vulnerability to natural disasters, and actually, as we speak in this Chamber tonight, flash floods in the South of France have so far taken the lives of 19 people. So disasters are not confined to the areas which are this evening's subject matter (Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary). Floods this year have also been hitting hard in the country where we are meeting tonight.\nWe are all aware that natural disasters are on the rise as climate change leads to more extreme weather events, and when faced with disasters of this magnitude, the national capacity to respond is simply overwhelmed. In such cases, European solidarity makes a difference in saving and protecting both lives and critical infrastructure. These floods we are discussing this evening have underlined the added value of a coordinated EU response.\nLet me take us back to the beginning of the floods in Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Very heavy rainfall and severe flooding affected the basins of the Vistula, Oder and Warta rivers in the first half of May. On Thursday, 19 May, Poland asked for assistance - specifically they asked for high-capacity pumps - through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, which I am responsible for. The EU response to this request was swift and generous, with eight Member States providing exactly what was needed - Germany, the Czech Republic, France, Denmark, and the Netherlands delivered within hours high-capacity pumps and technical expertise. An EU cofinanced multinational module developed by Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania under the Preparatory", "Social provisions of the Lisbon Treaty (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council's and Commission's statements on social regulations in the Treaty of Lisbon.\nPhilippe Courard\nMr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on behalf of Mrs Onkelinx, the Deputy Prime Minister, on the various new perspectives on social matters offered by the Treaty of Lisbon.\nI truly believe that we have to look at the social advances in European law. Thus, Article 9 of the treaty provides for a horizontal social protection clause which obliges the European institutions to take into account requirements linked to the promotion of a high level of employment, the guarantee of adequate social protection, the fight against social exclusion, and a high level of education, training and protection of human health.\nThis requirement follows the statement in Article 3(3) of the treaty that the internal market shall be constructed through policies based on a social market economy which is highly competitive and which tends towards full employment and social progress.\nArticle 9 accordingly calls for the social dimension to be taken into account from now on in the definition of all European policies. This is about restoring a fair balance between aspects that we will have to realise in practice. This is a priority cross-cutting objective of the Belgian Presidency.\nIn future, then, we will have to pay much more attention to the social impact of policies developed at European level. While we need to maximise economic growth within the European Union, we must also encourage the fair and just distribution across the board of the fruits of this growth, and we must take particular interest in the fate of the most vulnerable people.\nWe must also take the social dimension into account in the Europe 2020 strategy, which, as you know, was adopted by the European Union during the June European Council. This strategy, which is targeted at employment and growth, incorporates the economic,", "Cohesion policy\nPresident.\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following two reports on cohesion policy:\nA5-0267/2003 by Mr Mastorakis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission 'Second progress report on economic and social cohesion': regional trends, debate on future developments [COM(2003) 34 - 2003/2095(INI)]\nand\nA5-0188/2003 by Mr Pom\u00e9s Ruiz, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on structurally disadvantaged regions (islands, mountain regions, regions with low population density) in the context of cohesion policy, and their institutional prospects [2002/2119(INI)].\n\nMastorakis (PSE)\n, Rapporteur. (EL) Mr President, when asked which of the policies of the European Union affects you most, makes you feel more like a European citizen, European citizens refer to regional policy, cohesion policy, the policy that plays a central role in the process of European integration and in supporting the single market and economic and monetary union. In particular, we must stress the importance of this policy for boosting cohesion in an enlarged European Union, which will experience a particular increase in disparities between levels of development in its regions and the need to make resources available to match the new requirements. It is of vital importance to bridge these differences by fostering long-term, balanced and polycentric development throughout our European Union.\nFollowing the communication by the European Commission, therefore, our committee, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, held extensive discussions which resulted in its underlining certain - what it considered to be - basic points in connection with regional and cohesion policy. Thus it:\nendorses the Commission's stance of rejecting attempts at the renationalisation of regional and cohesion policy and its determination to maintain a genuine Community policy;\nsupports the Commission'", "Online gambling in relation to recent ECJ rulings (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on online gambling in relation to recent ECJ rulings, by Malcolm Harbour, Andreas Schwab, Evelyne Gebhardt, Cristian Silviu Bu\u015foi and Heide R\u00fchle, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection - B7-0235/2009).\nMalcolm Harbour\nauthor. - Mr President, first of all it is a privilege on behalf of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection to welcome our new Commissioner Michel Barnier for the first time to what I am sure will be many interchanges across the floor of this House, and particularly because he has moved seamlessly from his seat over there to his seat at the front in two days. Commissioner, we are very pleased to have you here.\nSecondly, on behalf of the committee, to have the chance essentially to put on record with this question our concern about the developments of online gambling, and indeed the gambling sector overall and some of the many uncertainties that are arising about the whole legislative regime for gambling within the internal market.\nI know you will have a considerable in-tray already, Commissioner, but we hope very much that this will be an item that will be close to the top of your in-tray because it is an area which my committee has been very concerned about over the last five years. We have done a number of own-initiative studies and questions about it and indeed the author of our last major report, Mrs Schaldemose, will be speaking later and so we have a sustained interest in this topic.\nAs you all know, the Member States have also been meeting together regularly at Council level on various reflection groups about how to tackle the issue about the growth of online gambling in relation to our own countries' gambling activities. I think I should make it clear first of all that this question does not in any way presuppose a new liberalisation of gambling markets or i", "15. Guidelines for the 2010 budget procedure - Sections I, II, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII and IX (\nBefore the vote:\nChristopher Beazley\nMr President, we do need to make progress, but I see that there has been the most absurd inflation of roll-call votes. The last report to be voted - the Herczog report - has a roll call on every single amendment. Could we call upon Mr Corbett and other luminaries to devise some rationing system so that we can actually get to lunch?\n", "13. European Financial Stability Facility and European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism and future actions (vote) \nBefore the vote:\nAnni Podimata\n(EL) Madam President, the procedural issue concerns the vote on Amendment 2. If Amendment 2 is passed, the original paragraph 14 lapses, because Amendment 2 applies to paragraph 14.\nUdo Bullmann\n(DE) Madam President, as the coordinator for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I would like to make a comment on Amendment 6. I would like to call on my group to vote in favour of Amendment 6, in contrast to what appears on our voting recommendations. This is a mistake in the list. We should vote for Amendment 6 and this is likely to clarify the way in which we will vote now in a decisive situation.\n", "Implementation of Directive 2006/43/EC on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is a short presentation of the report by Mr Doorn on implementation of Directive 2006/43/EC on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts.\nBert Doorn\nrapporteur. - (NL) Madam President, this report is about the implementation of the eighth directive on statutory audits of annual accounts. It is a good thing that Parliament is paying closer attention to the implementation and transposal of the legislation we pass here. We in Parliament can decide on the most outstanding rules and regulations, but if those rules and regulations are not implemented and complied with in the Member States, we are wasting our time here.\nIn the transposal of the eighth directive, too, many things have gone wrong. Key definitions are framed differently in different countries and the number of Member States that have independent public oversight is a long way short of 27. The report calls on the Commission to take steps quickly to correct these deficiencies.\nWe also wonder whether the method of harmonisation employed, namely minimum harmonisation, is indeed the right way to attain the uniform application of key concepts. Perhaps we do need to think again whether key definitions of this kind are the way forward or whether a different method of harmonisation - one that is not open to multiple interpretations - needs to be used.\nFinally, Madam President, the report discusses the Commission's recommendation on the limitation of the civil liability of accountants. Should further measures be necessary in order to achieve convergence in Europe, we shall look forward to the Commission's proposals.\nThe objective must and will remain to aim for the effective and independent auditing of accountants. The economic crisis has taught us that strict auditing and oversight are indispensible.\nJacques Barrot\nVice-President of the Commission. - ", "Taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments - Common system of VAT as regards tax evasion linked to import and other cross-border transactions (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following reports:\nby Mr Hamon, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments - C6-0464/2008 - , and\nby Mr Visser, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax as regards tax evasion linked to import and other cross-border activities - C6-0039/2009 -.\nBeno\u00eet Hamon\nMr President, I would like to begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to the adoption of this report in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, not least Mrs Pietik\u00e4inen and Mrs Raeva, and to congratulate the coordinators from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Mr Gauz\u00e8s and Mr Klinz, who played an important role in terms of ensuring that this report, which will be put to the vote tomorrow in our plenary session, was adopted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.\nYou know that at the conclusion of the G20 meeting, some of the EU Heads of State - and prominent ones at that - claimed victory by announcing, in a stream of communications, that the age of banking secrecy was over.\nThese thunderous statements aside, the European Parliament - and I welcome this - has now set out to do the practical work and has taken an interest not in communication but in the efforts it can make to effectively combat tax evasion, which is estimated to amount to EUR 200 billion each year. These EUR 200 billion should be compared with the amounts for the recovery plans to help the countr", "Improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding - Precarious women workers (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following reports:\nby Mrs Estrela, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 92/85/EEC on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding - C6-0340/2008 -, and by Mrs Thomsen, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on precarious women workers.\nEdite Estrela\nI would firstly like to thank the shadow rapporteur and the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for the collaboration and the work which we have accomplished together. A word of thanks is also due to many non-governmental organisations and unions, to the experts who participated in the presentation workshop for the financial impact study, to the secretariats of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and of my political group, to the Policy Department of the European Parliament, and to my assistants. All of them were tireless, and showed great professionalism and ability.\nThis directive is already eighteen years old, and it is outdated. The process of revising it has been long and problematic. It is now time for Parliament to decide, without further delay, to meet the expectations and needs of European families.\nThe proposals adopted by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality ensure the twin objectives arising from extending the legal basis: defending health and safety in the workplace for workers who are pregnant, who have recently given birth, or who are breastfeeding, and promoting gender equality and the reconciliation of professional and family life. At the ", "Welcome\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, allow me, on behalf of you all, to welcome a delegation from the Knesset headed by Amira Dotan.\nIn the framework of the regular contacts between the European Parliament and Israel, an interparliamentary meeting will take place during this part-session. This will be the 33rd such meeting between our two assemblies.\nI bid a warm welcome to Amira Dotan and the members of her delegation, with whom we have already had the opportunity - on Tuesday - to converse at greater length.\nWe wish you success and hope that your work will be marked by a willingness to engage in dialogue and a desire for mutual understanding - qualities that are indispensable to a resolute quest for peace in the Middle East.\nThe European Parliament is following that process very attentively and is determined to be an objective and active contributor to the pursuit of peace in the Middle East.\n(Applause)\n\nSarah Ludford\nMr President, this is about the building in Strasbourg and the decision to go back.\nThe Secretary-General sent an e-mail on Tuesday morning saying we would go back in October. I understand there was no vote or decision by the Bureau, which is strange.\nMr R\u00f8mer made no mention of the availability of the expert report. I had to rely on information from the Vice-President for Transparency to know that the Secretary-General had told the Bureau he would make it available to Members on request in the French and German versions in which it exists, although he would not translate it.\nI have now sent a total of three e-mails over the last two days asking for the report in French, with no response. I find this unacceptable and I am now raising the matter under Rule 28 of the Rules of Procedure on accountability and Rule 96 on transparency.\nI want to know the basis on which we are going back to Strasbourg. I have read the note which went to the Bureau on Monday, but it seems to me that the works only relate to the false ceilings. So, firstly, what do we know", "13. 5th World Water Forum in Istanbul, 16-22 March 2009 (vote) \n- After the vote on Amendment 5:\nIn\u00e9s Ayala Sender\nMr President, the Zaragoza 2008 International Expo closed on 14 September 2008. It was the first exhibition devoted exclusively to water and sustainable development, and the first exhibition in which the European Parliament took part on an equal footing with the Commission.\nThe three months of constant debates, with more than 2 000 experts and NGOs, resulted in the Zaragoza Charter, which precisely reflects the state of the debate between Mexico 2006 and Istanbul. Hence we propose the following recital, which I shall read in English:\n'having regard to the Zaragoza Charter of 2008 \"A New Comprehensive Vision of Water\u201d and the recommendations of the Water Tribune adopted on 14 September 2008, the closing day of the 2008 Zaragoza International Exhibition, and forwarded to the Secretary-General of the United Nations,'.\n", "Reform programme of the Polish shipyards (debate)\nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the reform programme of the Polish shipyards.\nMarek Siwiec\n(PL) Madam President, I would like to inform you that a Polish trade union delegation is seated in the gallery. They are going to listen to our debate. The delegation includes representatives of the Gda\u0144sk, Gdynia and Szczecin shipyards. I would like to ask you to welcome our friends from Poland.\nPresident\nThank you, Mr Siwiec; the delegation is very welcome.\nNeelie Kroes\nMember of the Commission. - Madam President, the Commission is well aware of the historic importance of the Polish shipyards, and that is why we have been working very hard to find a solution that will allow the restructuring of the sector in a way that provides a livelihood for the regions concerned. However, we depend on the cooperation of the Polish authorities to arrive at a viable solution. To be quite clear, the state aid investigation in these cases has been pending for around four years.\nThe investigation concerns a substantial amount of operating aid to the Szczecin, Gdynia and Gda\u0144sk shipyards. Without even counting the state guarantees from 2002 until now, the Gdynia shipyard received from the Polish state - which means from the Polish taxpayers - aid amounting to around EUR 167 000 per worker. That is approximately EUR 24 000 per worker per year, and that means that the subsidy to each shipyard worker is at least double the average annual income of Polish workers.\nEven without counting the state guarantees, the total aid received since 2002 by the Gdynia and Szczecin shipyards amount in nominal value to around EUR 700 million and EUR 1 billion respectively.\nDespite all that money, the yards and the future of the workers remain vulnerable. That, I would stress, is what really scares me. I think that the future of the workers needs to be taken into account. They have avoided the painful but necessary restructuring that, for exa", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 2 May 1998.\n\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, you are all aware that Italy is currently undergoing a time of great suffering and sorrow because of the tragic mudslides and floods which have affected various localities in the region of Campania, particularly Sarno, Bracigliano, Quindici and Siano. So far, there are known to have been 135 victims, and the number of people missing may be even higher. Ninety-five people have been injured, and more than a thousand have lost their homes and possessions.\nI think that at times like this it is important for the whole European Union to show solidarity with the victims and their families. If you agree, I will convey our institution's condolences and sympathy to the Italian authorities.\n\nMonti\nMr President, the Commission shares these sentiments regarding such a serious and immense tragedy and, for its part, is considering the possibility of some form of concrete intervention to show this solidarity.\n\nAhern\nMr President, I would like to inform this House that today at 13.00 hours GMT India made an underground thermonuclear test similar to the one that she conducted in 1974. I would ask this House to condemn these nuclear tests outright and condemn India for not being part of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. I would also ask this House to criticize the acknowledged five nuclear powers for setting a bad example and in particular for the nuclear test in Mururoa some time ago. We in the European Union have set India a bad example and I would also like this House to condemn the transfer of civil nuclear technology to third countries.\n\nRipa di Meana\nMr President, a very quick point of order to express the wish that the Commission may rapidly set aside an adequate sum to deal with the serious disaster which hit Campania and the Sarno valley.\n\nBianco\nMr President, I had already asked to speak, but you were sensitive enough to o", "Budget review (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the Commission statement on the budget review.\nJanusz Lewandowski\nMember of the Commission. - Madam President, today, the European Commission has adopted its Communication on the budget review to be communicated immediately, here in Parliament, to the representatives elected by the people.\nThis was originally foreseen for 2008-2009 but the chain of events - the late adoption of the Lisbon Treaty, the late appointment of the Commission and then a new EU 2020 strategy - explains why this is taking place in October 2010.\nThe budgetary review should be seen as an integral part of our reflection on how to make Europe more competitive, dynamic, inclusive and sustainable. However, it cannot be separated from the political goals. This is politics in figures and, historically, there has always been a specific political context associated with the budgetary debate. In the past, this was about the single market, single currency and enlargement.\nWe could wish for better political goals this time round, as there are clear new responsibilities stemming from the Lisbon Treaty. It is also clear that we need to find common European answers to common challenges in the areas of climate change, energy, security and migration.\nOn the other hand, we have a eurosceptic Europe and we have a eurosceptic post-crisis Europe. There is a real tension - or even a contradiction - between both and we should solve this tension. We need consensus; we need unanimity on the next financial perspective.\nWe should draw on experience, and this is part of the budgetary review. Experience teaches us that we have to readjust the balance between predictability and flexibility. Since its introduction in 1988, the financial framework has brought budgetary peace and predictability to Europe, providing a reasonable time horizon for our regions, farmers and researchers to prepare and realise their projects.\nThis is a real achievement. However, this p", "8.

I would like to thank the Commission and the Council for their very constructive cooperation.\nAt first reading stage, we worked through 58 amendments, most of which found their way into the draft, and it is through this result of informal negotiations that we now arrive at the Common Position, which we are able to accept and on which we are able to agree at second reading.\nWorking both with and for young people aged between 15 and 18, the perhaps some 170 million citizens who are the European Union's primary concern, all three institutions have endeavoured to find a solution that makes Europe real for them, that helps to make the programme less bureaucratic and makes access to it easier for disadvantaged young people.\nWe have, with this programme, had a number of general objectives in mind. First among them is the fostering of citizenship. We want to make it easier for young people to work together as members of society while also offering them the opportunity to cooperate at European level, thereby, among other things, overcoming voter apathy and awakening in them an interest in politics.\nSecondly, we want to promote solidarity and tolerance among young people, particularly as a means towards greater social cohesion in the EU. In this way, it will be possible for you", "Shared effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Satu Hassi, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the effort of Member States to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to meet the Community's greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments up to 2020 - C6-0041/2008 -.\nSatu Hassi\nMadam President, ladies and gentlemen, my sincerest thanks go to the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation. I also want to thank the Commission and the French Presidency of the Council of the European Union for all their efforts.\nI have to say, however, that I am not completely happy. The EU ought to have shown strong global leadership with this climate package. Unfortunately, that leadership was badly watered down when the French Presidency referred the decision for consensus by the Member States. Almost every prime minister went to the summit with the intention, based on national interests, of watering down the climate package, and indeed managed to. The outcome is of course a step forward, but a much, much smaller step than science is advising us to take.\nThe biggest problem with the Effort Sharing Decision is that the Member States are allowed all too freely to neglect their emission reductions at home and compensate for it by financing projects in developing countries. In the worst case scenario, this can simply lead to the stabilisation of emissions at home and keeping things as they are.\nThe outcome of the negotiations nevertheless preserves the sound basic structure of the Commission's proposal: a linear development in emission reductions and binding annual ceilings for emissions, in EU legislation for the first time.\nFurthermore, Parliament got through a number of important improvements that were based on the virtually unanimous report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. I", "8. External dimension of the area of freedom, security and justice (vote) \n- Report: Klich\n- Before the vote\nBogdan Klich \nrapporteur. - (PL) Mr President, I should like to offer my sincere thanks to everyone who contributed to this report. Special thanks are due to Mr Sakalas, the rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, who was involved in the difficult procedure of strengthened cooperation between two of our Parliamentary committees. I am also bound to call on the House to support this report, for three reasons.\nFirstly, because the report advocates better coordination between our foreign policy and our internal policy, to ensure that our foreign policy achieves the priorities of the area of freedom, security and justice.\nSecondly, because we advocate the specific European method which balances between action to ensure the security of our citizens and action to protect their civic freedoms.\nThirdly, because we are calling for what remains of the third pillar, notably police and court cooperation on criminal matters, to become a Community issue.\n- Before the vote on Amendment 3, first part\nSophia in 't Veld\nMr President, in order to avoid confusion, I should just like to clarify our request for a split vote and an oral amendment to Amendment 3.\nThe oral amendment concerns the part of the text that the amendment by the PPE-DE Group seeks to delete. Therefore, if you wish to retain the text, including the oral amendment, you should vote against the first part of Amendment 3.\nMr President, we propose to insert the words 'by the Council and the Commission', so that the text will read: 'to include a human rights compliance report by the Council and the Commission in all external policy initiatives or documents in the AFSJ...'.\nI must point out to you that, if this House supports Amendment 3, the oral amendment will fall. However, if Amendment 3 by the PPE-DE Group is rejected, then the oral amendment will be included.\n(The oral amendment was accepted)\n", "Cat and dog fur (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Svensson, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council banning the placing on the market and the import of, or export from, the Community of cat and dog fur and products containing such fur - C6-0428/2006 -.\nMarkos Kyprianou\nMadam President, we have had the opportunity in the past to discuss this proposal in committees and intergroups. I am sure you will understand that I am very happy to be having this debate with you tonight.\nFirst of all, I would like to express my sincere thanks for the work of all Members of the European Parliament, especially that of the rapporteur, who has done a very good job. I would also like to thank the draftswoman and draftsman of the other committees, Mrs Lucas and Mr Stevenson.\nIt was a real challenge for me when I was first confronted with this issue after taking up my post. For me, the most frustrating part was that we had an issue which was very close to the heart of European citizens and which had the support of the Council and, clearly, of the European Parliament but also of the Commission, yet we still had problems in proceeding with this proposal. The problems were, of course, legal and not the result of a lack of political will.\nI am happy that we have now reached a point where, using some imaginative and constructive approaches, we have managed to find solutions, and that we are now able to have a first reading agreement, which is very important to me. We are all familiar with the issue and know that the disturbing evidence of barbaric treatment of cats and dogs, which are bred and killed mainly for their fur, especially in Asia, has provoked a strong call for the Commission to take action.\nAs I have said, we had to find ways not only to express tangibly the political will of all the institutions involved and the citizens, but also to do so in a leg", "Follow-up of the Paris Declaration of 2005 on Aid Effectiveness (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report (\u03916-0171/2008) by Mr Van Hecke, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the follow-up to the Paris Declaration of 2005 on Aid Effectiveness (2008/2048(\u0399\u039d\u0399)).\nJohan Van Hecke\nrapporteur. - (NL) Three years ago, over a hundred donors and partner countries entered into a commitment in Paris to make aid to developing countries more effective, amongst other things to aim for more harmonisation, democratic control, mutual accountability and greater transparency.\nUnlike the earlier Monterrey Declarations, the Paris Declaration established clear objectives, translated into twelve actions and indicators, in fact a major step forward. In December this year in Accra, an initial assessment is to be made of what has become of all those fine promises.\nIt must be said that in recent years the European Commission has made great efforts to implement the new aid agenda. It can be proud of what it has achieved in terms of division of labour, better coordination and respect for the local contribution. In 2006, at the instigation of Commissioner Michel, it even went a little further than the undertakings in Paris and approved an ambitious plan of action and the concept of division of labour and results-based management. However, there is still work to be done. Many intentions still have to be put into practice.\nFor instance, aid is still not sufficiently geared to national systems and too many different payment systems are still involved. As regards the uncoupling of aid, we are hardly getting anywhere. Technical cooperation is still too donor-controlled. The Donor Atlas urgently needs to be updated and extended, and then mainly focused on the most neglected countries and sectors.\nApart from that, approval of the code of conduct for the division of labour is problematic. Firstly because the Member States do not fulfil their promises. The Member States are lagging behind,", "Adoption by Slovakia of the single currency on 1 January 2009(debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Casa, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision in accordance with Article 122(2) of the Treaty on the adoption by Slovakia of the single currency on 1 January 2009 - C6-0198/2008 -.\nLadies and gentlemen, let me congratulate Slovakia and our Slovak fellow Members on this success for their country and for the euro area.\nVladim\u00edr \u0160pidla\nMadam President, on behalf of the Commission, I would first like to thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the rapporteur, Mr Casa, for the excellent work they have done in assessing Slovakia's fulfilment of the convergence criteria for adopting the single currency.\nWith Slovakia's entry into the euro area, this will have sixteen members, four of them from the group of countries that joined the European Union in 2004.\nThis is the fifth enlargement of the euro area since the single currency was introduced in 1999. It is clear proof that it is open to all Member States meeting the conditions set by the Treaty.\nSlovakia's entry into the euro area represents the crowning of the remarkable progress made by the Slovakian economy over the last decade. It will enable the country to benefit from the important advantages offered by Economic and Monetary Union, as set out in the report adopted by the Commission last May on 10 years of EMU.\nThis report also demonstrates that, to benefit fully from the advantages of the euro, it is necessary to pursue sound macroeconomic policies to protect a country's competitiveness once the exchange rate is fixed irrevocably. This includes fiscal discipline, a responsible wage policy and structural reforms, particularly as regards the functioning of the labour market.\nWithout a clear commitment to this, there is a danger that inflation could become a real and considerable problem. This point is mentioned explicitly in Mr Cas", "Competition horizontal cooperation rules (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Mrs Bowles, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the review of the competition horizontal cooperation rules - B7-0565/2010).\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda-Margallo y Marfil\nMadam President, Commissioner, the two block exemption regulations, one of which refers to specialisation agreements and the other to research and development, will expire on 31 December of this year. The Commission has drawn up two legislative proposals: two proposals for regulations that are before this House to replace the regulations that are now coming to an end.\nA lot of water has flowed under the bridge since the initial regulations were adopted. There have been significant changes in legislation, especially the 2003 modernisation package, crucial legal judgments have been passed in this area and the Commission has learnt quite a lot from practice, which is also an important aspect.\nThe Commission opened two rounds of consultations with those concerned, which is good practice in the spirit of legislating well and having public support. The big question now is as follows: what use is it going to make of the responses from those concerned during the consultation? Is it going to take notice of them or are these opinions simply going to be thrown in the bin? In this context, what Parliament and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs want to know is essentially six things. What are the suggestions and specific ideas that the stakeholders have put forward that the Commission is going to take into account when it comes to designing and defining these regulations and taking them from 'the muses to the theatre'?\nSecondly, what does the Commission think about the horizontal agreements that are not covered by the exemption regulations on specialisation or research and development. What did the stakeholders say in this round of consultations? What w", "Signing of REACH and the seventh framework research programme\nPresident\nWe will now move on to the joint signing of the REACH programme and the Seventh Framework Research Programme.\nI think that it is appropriate for us to take a few minutes to sign officially in public, in this House, two important pieces of European legislation that Parliament and the Council have just adopted: REACH, the Regulation governing the chemical industry and its environmental impact, and the Seventh Framework Research Programme.\nThe joint signing of acts adopted under the codecision procedure is, as you know, the final stage in the Union's lengthy and complicated legislative process before the acts are published in the Official Journal. It is the moment when the two co-legislators (the Council and Parliament) add their political seal to the new legislation.\nI therefore have great pleasure in welcoming to Parliament this morning the Prime Minister of Finland, who is representing the Presidency of the Council and who will sign these important acts with me. I would also like to welcome Mr Barroso and invite him to join us for the photograph of the signing.\nI would like to thank, too, the various Members of the European Parliament who have been most closely involved in these two new legislative acts and ask them to witness the signing: the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, Mr Florenz; the REACH rapporteur, Mr Sacconi; the Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Mr Ransdorf; and the three rapporteurs for the Seventh Framework Research Programme, Mr Buzek, Mr Busquin and Mrs Laperrouze.\nBefore signing the acts, I think it would be appropriate for Mr Vanhanen to say a few words, if he so wishes.\nMatti Vanhanen\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure for me to be here today. The signing of this document is a historic moment. The REACH Regulation will mean a complete rev", "Investor-compensation schemes (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Olle Schmidt, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 97/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on investor-compensation schemes - C7-0174/2010 -.\nOlle Schmidt\nMadam President, Commissioner.\nMadam President, in this case I urgently need a broad consensus, so I will take another tone in this debate.\n(SV) I would like to thank all of the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission, the committee and the group secretariat for their excellent work. We had hoped to achieve our objective, but we are not quite there yet. Investor protection is a form of consumer protection for securities and money that banks and investment firms handle on their customers' behalf. It enables the customer to receive compensation by the State if an institution that goes bankrupt cannot release the customer's assets as a result of fraud or negligence or of serious erroneous assessments and mistakes. However, compensation is not provided for risk investments, for example if investments in shares fall in value.\nI will go through the committee's amendments point by point. Firstly, the committee wishes to increase the level of compensation to EUR 100 000 per investor and it wants the level of compensation to be the same for all EU Member States. The most compelling reason for proposing a level of EUR 100 000 is that there are countries with levels of compensation higher than the proposed EUR 50 000, including the United Kingdom, France and Spain. Thus, we do not wish to reduce the level of compensation and thereby worsen consumer protection in these countries. The level of protection should also be as high for investments as it is for bank account savings. We need people who want to invest in the enterprise of the future.\nSecondly, the committee wants to extend protection to include cases where it h", "32. Discharge 2005: Section II, Council (vote) \n- Report: Caspary\n- Before the vote:\nHerbert B\u00f6sch\n(DE) Mr President, before we move on to give discharge to the Council, I should like to draw the House's attention to the fact that the Council was not present for the debate on the Budget discharge of the Commission and the other institutions and is not, as we can see, present for the decision.\nIn view of the fact that 80% of the EU's Budget resources are handled via the Member States, which bear responsibility for these funds, we regard this as an intolerable state of affairs. We expect the Council, over the coming months, to come up with a definite action plan for the drafting of the national statements of assurance.\n(Loud applause)\nPresident\nI note the comment by Mr B\u00f6sch, which clearly does not prevent us from continuing with the vote. Voting by roll call on the discharge is now open.\n", "20. Road Map for renewable energy in Europe (vote) \n- Report: Thomsen\n- Before the vote on the legislative resolution:\nBritta Thomsen  \nrapporteur. - Mr President, I just want to say that I hope everyone will vote in favour of the resolution as it is very important that we stand together on this issue in the European Parliament.\n", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nHallam\nMr President, I would like to point out that on page 11 of the Minutes, there is a reference to my opposition to the urgency that came through yesterday. The Minutes do not accurately reflect my concern which was that the document (COM(97)0247) made a number of extreme statements about the use of nickel coins, saying it had important consequences for health and so on. Yet, just last week I received an answer from Mr De Silguy pointing out that this was absolute nonsense, that nickel does not pose a threat to health. But here we are about to insist that nickel is not used in the new euro coins. We have fifteen days to stop the European Union - the Council, the Member States, this Parliament and the Commission - making itself look very silly. I hope we can react accordingly.\n\nPresident\nThe services will take note of your point.\n\nCoates\nMr President, I rise in respect of the Minutes and the remark which is reported from my colleague Mr David who said that my complaint to you at the beginning of the week was made in a personal capacity. I wish, through you Mr President, to assure him that it was not made in a personal capacity but in my capacity as a Member of this House where I have certain democratic duties. It was not made from any personal sense of grievance whatsoever but in pursuance of my parliamentary duty.\nI promised you on Monday that I would report to you what happened when I finally received the letter from the General Secretary of the Labour Party, Mr Sawyer. I received this letter yesterday morning after enquiries had been made. In fact, it was a very conciliatory letter but insisted on remaining with the code of practice of which I complained. The problem is that subsequently I received a letter from the Labour Party Whip, threatening disciplinary action. Mr President, this is a very serious matter...\n\nPresident\nMr Coates, it is a ve", "Proposed hearing of the Commission on crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed by totalitarian regimes (8 April 2008) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed by totalitarian regimes.\nJacques Barrot\nVice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to report on the hearing on crimes committed by totalitarian regimes in order to address legitimate concerns raised by Parliament.\nOn 8 April 2008 the Commission and the Slovenian Presidency held a hearing on crimes committed by totalitarian regimes. This hearing was requested by the Council in April 2007 during the negotiations on the Framework Decision on combating racism and xenophobia. The purpose of the hearing was to gain a better understanding of how the Member States have coped with the legacy of totalitarian crimes and of the nature of the methods and practices that have been adopted in order to face up to this challenge.\nThe hearing focused on two main themes: the recognition of totalitarian crimes, and reconciliation. Given the sensitive nature of this issue and to prevent the matter from being exploited in any way, the Commission was keen for this debate to be, first and foremost, a debate among independent experts and academics from a variety of backgrounds who were committed to a scientifically based approach. The Member States were invited to attend, as was the European Parliament, and I am delighted that many MEPs were given the opportunity to take part in the debate. The hearing was conducive to constructive and dispassionate debate. In general, four issues emerged from the discussions that were of particular concern to the Commission.\nFirstly, there is the feeling that the old Member States should be made more aware of the tragic past of the new Member States. This lack of recognition should be carefully reviewed so as to avoid the Union being d", "European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights - Fundamental Rights Agency: activities under Title VI of the EU Treaty (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following reports:\nby Mrs Kinga G\u00e1l, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights - C6-0288/2005 -\nand\nby Mrs Magda K\u00f3s\u00e1n\u00e9 Kov\u00e1cs, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision empowering the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights to pursue its activities in areas referred to in Title VI of the Treaty on European Union - C6-0289/2005 -.\nFranco Frattini\nMr President, I believe that today marks an important stage in the assessment of a provision that is highly important both for the Commission and for Parliament. The initiative in question, which, first of all, was adopted in accordance with the formal rules of a procedure that excludes codecision, has subsequently been carried forward politically through an extremely close collaboration with Parliament. The trialogue method, which has enabled us to come to an agreement on many occasions, is, in fact, a political solution: even though, from an institutional and legal point of view, we are sadly not in the presence of a formal codecision procedure, this political solution has enabled us thus far to develop an excellent working relationship.\nI should like to thank the rapporteurs, Mrs G\u00e1l and Mrs K\u00f3s\u00e1n\u00e9 Kov\u00e1cs, for their useful collaboration. We have come to an agreement on many points, and I hope, too, that the few outstanding points can also be resolved by the end of the year so that, in 2007 - as has often been repeated by the European Council and Parliament, and as the Commission itself hopes - the Fundamental Rights Agency will at last become operational.\nWhat points still need to be considered and developed further, even after the last trialo", "Appointment of 7 members of the Court of Auditors (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate of seven reports from Mrs Ayala Sender, of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the proposed nomination of David Bostock, Michel Cretin, Maarten B. Engwirda, Henri Grethen, Harald Noack, Ioannis Sarmas and Hubert Weber as Members of the Court of Auditors.\nIn\u00e9s Ayala Sender\nrapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, as you all know, the members of the Court of Auditors are nominated by the Council, for a six-year mandate, following consultation with Parliament. It is the Committee on Budgetary Control which is responsible for preparing the opinion of the Parliament.\nThe Court is currently composed of 27 members, from the Member States of the Union, and we are now preparing to renew the mandate of four candidates: David Bostock, for the United Kingdom; Maarten B. Engwirda, for the Netherlands; Ioannis Sarmas, for Greece; and Hubert Weber, for Austria; and to propose three new members, Michel Cretin, for France; Henri Grethen, for Luxembourg; and Harald Noack, for Germany.\nDuring the procedure in the Committee on Budgetary Control, all candidates were approved but not all of them unanimously. However, we shall see that, subject to a few clarifications, in principle my final proposal is that, if there are no further comments, all these nominations should be approved.\nFollowing the personal interviews of the three new candidates, I would like to emphasise the good showing made by Mr Cretin, the French candidate, who will bring to the Court his considerable experience in international auditing, both in connection with the UN and NATO. The Committee on Budgetary Control considered this experience to be a huge plus.\nDuring the personal interviews of the four Members whose mandate is up for renewal, the most important topic was their opinion on the self-assessment process embarked upon by the Court of Auditors, which is due to terminate at the end of 2008, as well as the contribut", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament which was adjourned on Thursday, 31 May 2001.\n\nApproval of the Minutes of the previous sitting\nPresident\nThe Minutes of Thursday 31 May 2001 have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nFerber\nMadam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have a comment about the Minutes. In the Annex to the Minutes, in the Texts Adopted, on the M\u00e9ndes de Vigo report - I am just looking for my papers and of course cannot find anything now - it states at one point that a European constitution should be drafted. This goes back to a proposal for an amendment by Mr Brok. When I checked with Mr Brok, he confirmed that he did not choose this phrase in his proposal for an amendment. I would therefore request that the proposals for amendments be used to check again whether this theme has now been included correctly in the final M\u00e9ndes De Vigo document in all the languages, as we obviously want to avoid any misinterpretations here.\n\nPresident\nOf course, Mr Ferber, we shall certainly check this.\n(The Minutes were approved)\n\nAgenda\nPresident\nThe next item is the final draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents, pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.\nI have no requests for amendments to Monday or Tuesday's agendas.\nRelating to Wednesday:\nI have received a request from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to postpone to a later part-session the joint debate on the annual report by Mr Wuori, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on human rights in the world in 2000 and the European Union Human Rights Policy, and the Council statement on the European Union strategy in the international organisations.\nA representative from the Group of the European People' s Party will be taking the floor, so that Parliament can discuss the outcome of the Irish referendum on the Treaty of Nice, in", "European Arrest Warrant (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the oral questions to the Council and the Commission on the European Arrest Warrant.\nJan Philipp Albrecht\nauthor. - (DE) Madam President, today we find ourselves debating the issue of the European Arrest Warrant. It is high time that this discussion was brought to the table. We have submitted a question through the groups tabling a debate on the reform of the European Arrest Warrant and its application, and are asking the Commission and Council to respond with proposals.\nThe European Arrest Warrant was trumpeted as the perfect example of mutual recognition in the area of justice and policing. When the European Arrest Warrant was passed as a framework decision, the European Parliament always made it perfectly clear that, on the one hand, the conditions for applying the European Arrest Warrant are relatively strict, so that it should apply only to really serious crimes, that it should be applied in a proportionate way, and that the procedural standards in the European Union should be harmonised at the same time. None of these requirements has really been met in full. In many specific cases, the Arrest Warrant is not applied in a proportionate way, as we can see in the reports now available to us. Thus, we need to adjust procedures, both in practice and in legislation. Thanks to the work of Vice-President Reding, after ten years, we are finally making progress in harmonising procedural standards. However, it is essential that we should make numerous further advances, including in relation to the conditions under which prisoners are held and the question of individual standards of legal protection.\nIn future, our sole concern should not just be the cooperation between the police and judicial authorities as regards mutual recognition; we must also look at the establishment of procedural standards. Nonetheless, the European Arrest Warrant must be amended today, as its application is obviously incompatible with t", "Explanations of vote\nDen Dover  \nin writing. - Conservatives have supported the Vakalis report but have grave reservations about paragraphs 16 and 17. We believe that both prevention and rapid reaction capabilities in relation to earthquakes should be concentrated on the resources of the Member States and do not support 'the establishment of a European Civil Protection Force.'\nGlyn Ford  \nin writing. - I am in favour of this report on the regional impact of earthquakes. As a geologist and oceanographer - in fact my thesis was on the seismicity of the mid-Atlantic ridge from 12\u00b0N to 20\u00b0S. I am all too well aware that the United Kingdom is almost immune. According to records in the UK, only one person has died as the result of an earthquake and that was in the mid-seventeenth century. Yet across Europe the same is not true, with thousands killed, and massive devastation across the centuries from Lisbon to Sarajevo.\nPart of my own constituency, Gloucestershire, was devastated by floods in July that caused billions of euros of damage to road and rail, hospitals and schools, water treatment plants and power stations. We are likely to get assistance from the European Solidarity Fund. I hope it will not prove necessary, but if it does Europe must prove willing to assist nations, regions and committee hit by earthquakes.\nPedro Guerreiro  \nin writing. - (PT) As has been pointed out, the whole of southern Europe is delimited by the edge of two tectonic plates that cross the Mediterranean and go on through the Atlantic Ocean via some of the Azores Islands, which means that earthquakes are one of the most frequent natural disasters in this region.\nThis EP report contains a variety of concerns and proposals that we appreciate, particularly when it recognises that the outermost regions suffer these phenomena regularly, or when it points to the need, among other things, to support national action in terms of prevention, response and repairing damage, public information, scientific", "Common organisation of the market in wine (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Batzeli, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the reform of the common organisation of the market in wine.\nKaterina Batzeli \nMadam President, as you said, today's debate in the European Parliament on the reform of the COM in wine introduces a cycle of speculation on the future of one of the most important productive, economic and commercial sectors in the European Union.\nWhat we need to focus on today in this review is the objective of keeping the European sector at the top of the world league, the simplification of Community legislation, compatibility with other European development policies, product recognition, the proportionality of products and the cohesion of all wine-growing areas.\nThis was also the message from discussions in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and from the opinions of the Committees on International Trade and Regional Development and from our consultations with operators in the sector at national and European level.\nThe reform of the sector must take account of the specific characteristics of wine production at regional and national level, the structure and organisation of the sector, its export capacity and the fact that it may be the only product to which Community legislation applies with a high degree of subsidiarity.\nThe arrangements under present policies and funding for the current COM, which have often distorted the market and the competitiveness of the product, should be converted so that the Community budget of EUR 1.3 billion under the first pillar is allocated to policies which will aim in the long term at:\nmaintaining and strengthening European vineyards;\nreinforcing and improving the competitiveness of the sector at European and international level;\na territorial approach that takes account of environmental protection and protection of natural resources by financing agricultural cultiva", "EC-USA air transport agreement (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr El Khadraoui, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a decision of the Council and the representatives of the governments of the Member States of the European Union, meeting with the Council, on the conclusion of the Air Transport Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, on the one hand, and the United States of America, on the other hand [8044/3/07 - - C6-0210/2007 -.\nJacques Barrot\nVice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr El Khadraoui, Parliament played a major political role in helping us sign the first EU-US air transport agreement on 30 April in Washington.\nBy backing the agreement on 14 March, even before the Committee on Transport and Tourism had made its announcement, Parliament played an extremely decisive role in modernising the arrangements regulating transatlantic aviation and offering new possibilities to European citizens. The agreement will enter into force in March next year, and European and US businesses are on their starting blocks for new transatlantic connections. The Joint Committee which is to operate the agreement has already met in June. It is due to meet again in November to ensure smooth application and start work on important issues such as competition or security.\nYou make a number of key points in your formal discussions on the agreement today, which I share. You emphasise the importance of a second stage agreement to move forward access to the US market, especially as a means of taking European investment to the United States. You emphasise the importance of converging our regulations, particularly with regard to security, in a bid to obtain 'one-stop security'. You emphasise the importance of the environmental aspect, and CO2 emissions trading in particular. Lastly, you also emphasise the importance of informing and consulting Parliament.\nI also share yo", "3. Iran, in particular, the case of Nasrin Sotoudeh\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on seven motions for resolutions on Iran, in particular, the case of Nasrin Sotoudeh.\nBastiaan Belder\nMr President, exactly one week ago, Nobel Prize winner, Shirin Ebadi, published a penetrating article in The Wall Street Journal about her friend, the Iranian human rights lawyer, Nasrin Sotoudeh, who had just been sentenced to eleven years' imprisonment. Ebadi called for the West to pay greater attention to the Sotoudeh case and to all the brave human rights defenders in the territory of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\nThe debate in this House is part of the response to Ebadi's urgent appeal. We cannot and shall not forget Nasrin Sotoudeh, nor her fellow fighters for fundamental rights in Iran. That will also be the message, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, of the report that I hope to present on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs at the plenary sitting in March, and I count on all of you to vote in favour of it. A powerful, united European voice for the rights of the Iranian people.\nMarietje Schaake\nauthor. - Mr President, once again, we are forced to speak about human rights in Iran, after Nasrin Sotoudeh was sentenced to 11 years in jail. She is banned from practising law, but let us serve justice.\nThe Rule of Law is no longer practised or existent in Iran, and the judiciary is highly politicised. Defending human rights is now considered an act against national security. Nasrin Sotoudeh, lawyer and mother of two, is charged with acting against national security. She defended, among others, Zahra Bahrami, an Iranian-Dutch citizen who was sentenced to death before Dutch diplomats had talked to her, and in a climate of serious doubts about due process.\nAs strong a woman as Nasrin Sotoudeh is and was, by standing for justice, we see a weak regime that represses its citizens instead of providing for their wellbeing. High Representative Ashton will be in Istanbul later t", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nvon Habsburg\nMadam President, I would like the Bureau to address the following problem. We discussed the urgencies yesterday, which included a motion for resolution I tabled on the situation in Georgia. After the vote I discovered to my surprise that a letter, signed by an official of this Parliament, was sent to various Members - not to me, of course - on official Parliament paper, calling on them not to vote for it.\nI would just like to know whether we have now reached the point where our bureaucrats can actually determine Members' voting behaviour. Would you please investigate this?\n\nPresident\nWe take note of that, Mr von Habsburg, and I should be grateful if you could provide us with this letter.\n\nvon Habsburg\nI have it here with me, Madam President.\n\nKerr\nMadam President, on page 58 of the Minutes there is an account of an exchange between the President and certain Members concerning who is currently a member of the British Conservative Group. Unfortunately, the President's remarks have been edited and his full wit and humour have not been reflected in the Minutes. Could we have a full record? Could we have an assurance from the Conservative Group as to whether Mr Donnelly and Mr Stevens are currently members of that group or not? I gather that yesterday they came in and out several times. For the record, we should know what the current state is\n\nPresident.\nThat does not concern the Minutes, Mr Kerr, but the Verbatim Report of Proceedings. It is the Minutes that we are currently approving.\n\nChichester\nMadam President, my comment is also on the Minutes, because I note that Vice-President Martin was successful in having expunged from the record his comments about having to telephone No 10 Downing Street for instructions on how to vote. If that facility is available to Vice-Presidents - and good luck to him - is it available to other Members? By the", "AIDS\nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission Statement on AIDS.\nVladim\u00edr \u0160pidla\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years considerable progress has been made, broadly speaking, in the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic, including better access to effective treatment and to prevention programmes. Nevertheless, the number of people infected with HIV or dying of AIDS continues to grow. By the end of 2006, almost 40 million people will have been infected with HIV, 2.6 million more than at the end of 2004. It is estimated that in 2006 4.3 million people, both adults and children, have been newly infected with HIV, which is 400 000 more than two years ago.\nSub-Saharan Africa remains at the forefront of this epidemic. More than 63% of all adults infected with HIV now live in Sub-Saharan African countries, and 33% in South Africa. The biggest increase in the past two years has been observed in Eastern Asia, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, where the number of people infected with HIV has risen by 21%. The continuing growth in the number of newly diagnosed infections in most EU Member States, together with the results of Eurobarometer surveys from 2005, indicate that levels of awareness on epidemics in the EU and in neighbouring countries must be raised as a matter of urgency and that prevention programmes in this field must be strengthened. The strategy set up by the Commission in 2005 was centred around the priority of strengthening prevention, treatment and care in certain regions.\nDespite these disturbing figures, there has been a reduction in the incidence of AIDS in some African and Caribbean countries and in some regions of southern Asia. It is possible to reverse the trend. There are more women around the world infected with HIV than ever before. In 2006, the number of infected women has reached 17.7 million, a million cases more than in the last two years. The situation in Sub-Saharan African countries is worse still. Women account for 60% of adults of ", "Opening of the session\nPresident\nI declare opened the 1999-2000 session of the European Parliament.\n\nDecision on urgent procedure\nvon Wogau\nMadam President, let me say in regard to this item that we have not yet concluded our discussions in committee, and therefore cannot agree to the request for urgent procedure at this part-session. But I would suggest we deal with it at the second March part-session, by which time we will have concluded our discussions.\n\nPresident\nMr von Wogau, another solution would be - if you and the House were to agree to it - for us to vote in favour of urgency now, but to include this on the agenda for the sitting on 22 March. Would you be in agreement with that proposal?\nParliament agreed to urgent procedure for 22 March\n\nAmendment of the Rules of Procedure\nPresident\nThe next item is the report (A4-0070/99) by Mr Corbett, Mr Guti\u00e9rrez D\u00edaz and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, on behalf of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, on the amendments to be made to the Rules of Procedure.\nI would inform the House that Mr Crowley has endorsed the minority opinion which is set out in the explanatory statement.\nI give the floor to Mr Fabre-Aubrespy for a procedural motion.\n\nFabre-Aubrespy\nMadam President, under Rule 128 I must move the admissibility of the document to be debated. Either I can table it now or I can wait until you have formally opened the debate on this document, as you wish.\n\nPresident\nWe are at the beginning of the debate, so you have the floor, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy.\n\nFabre-Aubrespy\nMadam President, the purpose of this inadmissibility motion is to raise procedural issues which emerged during the drafting of this text. I am disputing the debate on this text on two essential grounds. The first is that it is intended to make some of the proposed changes to the Rules of Procedure in implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam. People may say that the Treaty of Amsterdam has been ratified, or just a", "11. Situation in Tibet (vote) \nPresident\nThe House was almost unanimous in expressing its views on this important issue and I hope that those to whom this vote is addressed will heed its message.\n", "23. Conditions of employment of other servants of the European Communities (\n- Before the vote (oral amendments to Amendments 62, 65 and 75)\nGiuseppe Gargani\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur I wish to table three oral amendments: to Amendment 62 - on the voting list, if you can follow - regarding recital 12, I propose that the entire parenthetic clause from 'annual amounts' up to 'annual budget' be deleted.\nTo Amendment 65 on the voting list, concerning recital 12c, I propose that the following parenthetic clause be inserted between the words 'parliamentary assistance' and 'cover the total costs': 'the annual amounts necessary will be determined within the annual budgetary procedure'.\nTo Amendment 75, which concerns Article 131, my oral amendment is to add the word 'transparent' to the words 'reference framework', to give 'transparent reference framework'.\nThese are the oral amendments that I am tabling to the House as rapporteur. I hope that they are accepted.\nGiuseppe Gargani\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would formally ask the Commission whether it is in agreement in respect of all these accepted amendments.\nMargot Wallstr\u00f6m\nVice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission is pleased that an agreement has been reached between the institutions on a joint text for a statute for parliamentary assistants.\nOn behalf of the Commission, I can confirm today our agreement on this text, which preserves the full substance of our initial proposal. The Commission prepared this proposal in response to a request from the European Parliament to the Commission in a letter from President P\u00f6ttering to President Barroso. Only eight months after this request, you have now endorsed the result of the very constructive discussions between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. With this proposal, for the third time in 10 years, the Commission took the initiative of addressing the issue of a statute, and we firmly believe that this time we wi", "International adoption in the European Union (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission, by Mrs Angelilli, on international adoption in the European Union - B7-0670/2010).\nRoberta Angelilli\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, over the years, many of my fellow Members and I have become aware of the problem of abandoned children, orphans and street children. Amongst the associations that contacted me was the Amici dell'adozione.\nThere are many abandoned children, not only in the developing world, but also in Europe. These are children who become invisible and end up in the vicious circle of poverty and social exclusion or, worse still, are exploited by organised crime for begging, illegal work, prostitution, organ trafficking or illegal adoptions. Often, these children spend their youth shuttling between social workers and orphanages.\nWe must guarantee these children the right to be adopted and the right to have a family. A child should spend as little time as possible in an institution. Obviously, the aim is the best interests of the child, so the ability to be adopted must certainly be granted warily, under the scrupulous supervision of the competent domestic authorities. However, where suitable conditions exist, children have the right to be adopted, above all at national level, but also at international level, within the European Union.\nI know that the Commission is aware of this, even if it is a matter of purely national competence. However, some sort of cooperation between the Commission and Member States would be desirable to ensure good practices and strategies capable of guaranteeing the utmost transparency and to prevent possible illegal and casual adoptions, but also to ensure the maximum level of cooperation from Member States in guaranteeing the right of adoption and preventing children from being abandoned to themselves or, as I said before, abandoned to an institution.\nKristalina Georgieva\nMember of the Commis", "2. Europol staff salaries and allowances (vote) \n- Report: Cavada\nRichard Corbett\nMr President, can you not take the entire group of reports under Rule 131 as single votes en bloc?\nPresident\nThe budget procedure stipulates a separate vote on each report. All I can do to speed up voting is to avoid the reference to the simplified procedure for each report.\n", "Power of legislative delegation (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Sz\u00e1jer, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the power of legislative delegation -.\nJ\u00f3zsef Sz\u00e1jer\nrapporteur. - (HU) Madam President, Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, many speakers start their speech in Parliament by saying that their topic is important, very important or even among the most important. I, too, would like to say this, but with much more reason than many others, since the subject we are discussing now, Parliament's power of legislative delegation to the Commission, is perhaps the most important and yet often neglected innovation in the Treaty of Lisbon.\nThose who criticised the Treaty of Lisbon spoke of a democratic deficit. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that this amendment, that is, the guarantee of Parliament's power of legislative delegation, is one of the most significant expansions of Parliament's jurisdiction. This means that representatives elected directly by citizens will henceforth be able, in Parliament and by virtue of their legislative powers, to oversee and veto the implementing resolutions and decisions introduced by the European Commission. In other words, this element of the Treaty of Lisbon, frequently mentioned in connection with the expansion of Parliament's powers, namely, that the codecision procedures have increased significantly in number and that the areas in which Parliament can participate have expanded, represents, along with the question of Parliament's power of legislative delegation, not only a quantitative but also a significant qualitative expansion. In other words, from now on, as the result of a long struggle and battle which has been fought here for many years, and which continues to be fought by the Members of the European Parliament, we are guaranteed that the decisions taken by the European Commission which do not fall within its own jurisdiction but are adopted through delegated legislative powers are overseen by Parliament.", "17. Adaptation of a number of instruments to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, 'omnibus' Regulation, Part Four (\n- Before the vote\nMargot Wallstr\u00f6m\nVice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission welcomes the agreement reached in first reading on the last of our four proposals on the alignment of existing legislative acts in the new comitology procedure with scrutiny.\nIn the framework of this agreement, the Commission would like to make two statements, the text of which I will hand over to your services in order to include them in the record of this sitting.\nThe first statement concerns a commitment of the Commission concerning the transmission of draft measures to the European Parliament when the time limits have been curtailed, and the second statement relates to the application of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny as regards the procedural rules for the updating of the Community blacklist of air carriers subject to an operating ban.\nCommission statements\nTransmission of draft measures to the European Parliament\nThe time-limits within which the European Parliament and the Council may oppose a draft measure, according to Article 5a(3)(c) of Council Decision 1999/468/EC, have been curtailed to four weeks or one month, in some provisions of the following basic acts: Directive 2004/17/EC, Directive 2004/18/EC and Regulation (EC) No 2111/2005. When transmitting draft measures to the European Parliament and to the Council in application of those provisions, the Commission commits itself, except during the European Parliament's periods of recess, to take into account the necessity for the European Parliament to hold a plenary session before the expiration of the relevant curtailed time-limits, and reiterates its commitments under the Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on procedures for implementing Council Decision 1999/468/EC, as amended by Decision 2006/512/EC, in particular in respect of the early warning system pr", "1. Allegation of mass graves in Indian-administrated Kashmir\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the allegation of mass graves in Indian-administrated Kashmir.\nMarios Matsakis\nauthor. - Mr President, I am very glad about the very wise decision you have taken.\nCommissioner, thousands of civilians have been the victims of extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances, torture, rape and other serious human rights abuses which have occurred in Jammu and Kashmir since the beginning of the armed conflict there in 1989. Shamefully, most of these crimes have not been fully resolved to date. Furthermore, there is real concern about the safety of human rights activists, including those who are seeking to investigate the fate of the many missing persons.\nThis Parliament strongly condemns all acts involving human rights abuses in the region and calls upon all governments concerned to show a strong will to uphold the rule of law and justice and to redouble their efforts in order to secure full investigations into the politically motivated crimes committed in Jammu and Kashmir in the past.\nRyszard Czarnecki\nauthor. - (PL) Mr President, I must say that it is not good when a president from the old EU discriminates against Members from the new EU by twice allowing a Member from the old EU, Mr Posselt, to speak, while I, the co-author of three reports, cannot rise to speak even once on this matter. I class this as discrimination and something that is totally unacceptable. I shall be submitting an appropriate letter on this, Mr President. This is a very disturbing thing.\nWith regard to this situation, we are not looking at a black-and-white film. On the border between India and Pakistan conflicts arise that are often provoked by the Pakistani state, as we very well know. We know about the so-called line of control guarded by the armed forces of the two countries. Following the recent 20-year period of peace along this border, Pakistan has resumed", "Question Time (Council) \nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B6-0006/2009).\nThe following questions have been submitted to the Council.\n\nSubject: SMEs\nGiven that the economy is one of 'the 3 Es' of the Czech Presidency's priorities, what specific steps will the Council be taking to enhance the confidence of small and medium-sized enterprises in the market economy in light of the current economic situation?\nAlexandr Vondra\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - Let me begin by saying that I appreciate the question on SMEs, because during this current economic crisis the big businesses and the big companies are always strong enough to lobby for some relief, but it is much more difficult for SMEs and it certainly requires a systemic approach.\nOn 1 December 2008, as you know, the Council endorsed the European Economic Recovery Plan, which was presented by the Commission on 26 November 2008. As a response to the financial crisis, the Council supported a stimulus which is equivalent to about 1.5% of the EU's gross domestic product to restore business and consumer confidence. Furthermore, the plan contains specific measures to support SMEs, the most important of which are those aimed at improving access to finance for SMEs and reducing the administrative burden.\nThe Council also agreed that improvements in the framework conditions for European businesses, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, was essential to counter the effect of the crisis on competitiveness and to support and enhance job creation.\nThe Council also adopted two sets of conclusions related to providing support for SMEs, in the context of overall competitiveness. Firstly, conclusions endorsing proposals to support SMEs presented in the Commission Communication entitled, as you probably know, 'Think Small First: a Small Business Act for Europe', this so-called SBA, including an action plan outlining the priority measures requiring particular attention.\nSecondly, conclusions from the Commi", "Voting time\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, I should like to welcome you all most warmly.

It is convening an extraordinary plenary sitting on Tuesday, 24 June 2008, from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m., for a joint debate on the outcome of the European Council of 19 and 20 June 2008 and the report on the Slovenian Presidency's six-month term.\n", "Financing instrument for development cooperation (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Mitchell, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation: lessons learned and perspectives for the future.\nGay Mitchell\nrapporteur. - Mr President, the DCI, the European Union's Development Cooperation Instrument, is a powerful tool. Covering the period between 2007 and 2013, the EU has at its disposal a budget of almost EUR 17 billion to combat poverty, to help achieve the Millennium Development Goals and to promote democratic governance in developing countries. Parliament has closely followed the functioning and impact of the instrument to ensure that the money is spent in accordance with these objectives.\nAt the end of this year, the Commission is going to present its proposals for the next generation of financing instruments for external action, to cover the post-2013 Multiannual Financial Framework. Therefore, the Committee on Development has taken the initiative to analyse the lessons learnt with the DCI and to define our expectations for the future instrument.\nThe Committee on Development was unanimous in supporting the following key principles.\nWe need a financing instrument which is exclusively targeted at the objectives of poverty eradication as defined in the Lisbon Treaty and which only covers developing countries. The new instrument must primarily fund measures which fulfil the criteria for ODA (Official Development Assistance) as defined by the OECD Development Assistance Committee.\nThe ODA quota must be even stricter than in the current DCI. Let me be clear that we do not question the importance of non-ODA cooperation with developing countries, in particular, the emerging markets and strategic middle-income countries, but this form of cooperation should be channelled through separate instruments to enhance transparency and protect the specific natu", "Reduced rates of value added tax (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs van den Burg on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 2006/112/EC as regards reduced rates of value added tax - C6-0299/2008 -.\nIeke van den Burg\nrapporteur. - (NL) This report on reduced VAT rates has been on quite a journey. In actual fact, there is no report left, because the two other big groups, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, failed to show up to the vote on my report in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and, without any warning, voted against beforehand because they did not like the rejection or adoption of one amendment or another.\nBy doing so, they have put the support for this important Commission proposal at serious risk. I regret this deeply because it has created completely the wrong impression about the European Parliament's position. Fortunately, they have backtracked and have now indicated that the Commission's proposal can count on their full support. We agreed that we would no longer bicker about these amendments during the plenary, but would instead accept Commissioner Kov\u00e1cs' proposal with a resounding 'yes'.\nUnfortunately, Mrs Lulling nevertheless laboured under the misapprehension that she had to retable her rejected amendments, even though this is not really consistent with the text of the legislative resolution or the procedure we are following. There is apparently here in this Parliament a variation on the Latin saying Quod licet Iovi, non licet bovi, what is legitimate for Mrs Lulling, is not legitimate for an ordinary MEP. Without taking anything away from her divine status, I would urge you not to be distracted by this and to vote emphatically in favour of the legislative resolution during the roll-call vote at the end. This is what this is a", "Welcome\nPresident\nI am delighted to welcome Alexander Milinkevich and Alexander Kozulin to the distinguished visitors' gallery today. Our two visitors are prominent leaders in the democratic opposition movement in Belarus. During the presidential elections in 2006 they bravely challenged the undemocratic government of the time, repeatedly showing great courage, and were greatly hindered in their untiring efforts to bring freedom and democracy. It is a great honour for us that Mr Milinkevich, the leader of the freedom movement and winner of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in 2006, and Mr Kozulin, a former political prisoner and the honorary chairman of Hramada, the Belarusian Social Democratic Party, are present for today's debate here in Parliament on the situation in Belarus.\n(Applause)\n", "2. Azerbaijan (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Azerbaijan.\nMarie-Christine Vergiat\nMr President, this is another occasion when we find ourselves looking into the situation in Azerbaijan. The democratic situation in that country is dramatic enough. However, this is a country that is a not insignificant partner within the European Union's Eastern Partnership.\nOpposition parties and non-governmental organisations continue to denounce attacks on human rights and the political repression which is rife there, not to mention the corruption of the regime in power. The values of democracy and human rights form an integral part of the values of the European Union, in theory.\nShould we not draw lessons from what is happening in what are called the Arab countries and not demand of our Eastern partners what we did not demand of some governments, notably those of Tunisia, Libya or Egypt? Should we not, Mr Andor, see to it that democracy can finally rule in those countries, that we have minimum requirements in the matter?\nFor my part, I find that the resolution we have before us is, at best, a resolution with as low a profile as it is possible to have. For this reason, we have dissociated ourselves from it and we shall make do with abstaining on the vote.\nCharles Tannock\nauthor. - Mr President, Azerbaijan is, regrettably, a one-party, semi-authoritarian state where political opposition to the dynastic rule of the Aliyev family is barely tolerated.\nLast December's elections predictably delivered an overwhelming majority for Heydar Aliyev's New Azerbaijan Party. In response, the OSCE stated that the conduct of these elections overall was not sufficient to constitute meaningful progress in the democratic development of that country. The OSCE's report went on to say that freedom of expression was limited and that normal political discourse was almost impossible, partly because of tight constraints on the media.\nNow we are hearing new re", "7. Compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights (vote) \n- Before the vote on paragraph 15(2):\nJohannes Voggenhuber \nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, shortly before the vote, my attention was drawn to a problem that is very easily solved. Paragraph 15 reads: 'intends to this end to amend Rule 34 of its Rules of Procedure'. As we need a different majority for Rules of Procedure than for this vote, many Members find the word 'intends' too strong.\nI would therefore suggest amending paragraph 15 as follows: 'is to this end considering an amendment to the Rules of Procedure'. I hope the PPE-DE Group will also be able to agree to amending the Rule in this way.\n(Parliament adopted the oral amendment)\n", "Prevention of natural and man-made disasters (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the prevention of natural and man-made disasters by Jo\u00e3o Ferreira, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety - B7-0201/2011).\nJo\u00e3o Ferreira\nMr President, Commissioner, two years has passed since the Commission launched a communication in February 2009 on a Community approach to the prevention of natural and man-made disasters. The importance of this issue was outlined. Since then, various disasters have hit Europe and have had severely negative consequences for the public, the land, the economy and the environment.\nIn general terms, the Commission's communication followed a proper approach, albeit an inadequate one, as was considered by Parliament. In addition, the Commission is delaying in implementing the commitments it assumed in this communication.\nOne example of this is its commitment to draw up a list of preventative measures to be funded by the European Union and implemented by the Member States. Two years later, and where is this list? Is the Commission going to wait for the next multiannual financial framework before presenting it? Another two years from now?\nMeanwhile, in September of last year, Parliament adopted a report on this very matter. This report puts forward a set of important recommendations. It is important to say that this report was preceded by a much wider debate, not only here in Parliament, but also with a wide range of national, regional and local entities, operating in different phases of disaster management.\nThe report also gathered a lot of experience of these catastrophes with the people who were affected by disasters over the last year. Here, I would like to mention a few of the specific points of the report, from the many that it contains. A range of actions were defined as targets for special support to the Member States, with a view to remedying situations of risk", "Order of business\nPresident\nThe final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 14 October 2010, pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed.

They do want to vote, but at a later date. This motion will be presented by a representative of the Group of the Greens. Is anyone ready to speak?\nDaniel Cohn-Bendit\nMr President, please excuse me; I was receiving a report about the situation in Belgium, and I did not fully understand.\nIf I understand correctly, this is about the vote on the 2012 calendar. Mr President, in our group, as in others, discussions are taking place on this calendar for, I repeat, 2012.\nAs it is not a legislative text, there is no debate and there are no amendments. We are simply voting on the calendar. We call for this vote to be postponed by one part-session and for it to therefore be held next month in Strasbourg, so that we can make contact with the other groups and see whether we cannot start taking some tentative steps towards reforming the calendar.\nFrancesco Enrico Speroni\nMr President, this is the first time that this Parliament has voted on a calendar so far ahead of time. Yet this is not such an unusual event because, in effect, the calendar reflects what we have always done; there are no particular changes.\nContrary to what has been suggested by Mr Cohn-Bendit, it is possible to table amendments, indeed - according to the e-mail - some members intend to do so. I see no reason in delaying the vote since, if it is true that the calendar will come into effect in 2012, we will still have the power and the option to make changes in the event that they are deemed necessary.\n", "Question Time (Council) \nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B7-0006/2010).\nThe following questions are addressed to the Council.\nSubject: Creating an internal energy market\nCreating a single internal energy market is referred to as a political priority in the agreement and long-term strategy of the troika of Spain, Belgium and Hungary. In order to attain this objective, the most isolated regions of the Community, such as the Baltic Sea region, need to be better integrated into the European energy market. The Baltic Sea Strategy contains many electricity and gas interconnection projects, which, if implemented, will allow Baltic countries to break free from their energy dependency on a single supplier. In view of their cross-border nature, implementing these projects successfully will depend not only on providing funding but also on the political will and intentions of the Member States involved. In creating an internal energy market, the Community has undertaken to speak with one voice.\nWill Spain, which holds the Presidency of the Council, take a lead role in encouraging Member States to speak with one voice in the implementation of energy projects in the Baltic Sea region, such as AmberLitPol, Swedlink and others, that would bring about an increase in energy security not only at a regional level but throughout the Community?\nDiego L\u00f3pez Garrido\nMadam President, the internal energy market and security of energy supply are inextricably linked. We have gradually realised this in the European Union and energy security has therefore become one of the Union's strategic priorities. Indeed, this became a critical issue just over a year ago, with the gas crisis between Russia and Ukraine.\nWe realised at that point that an internal energy market, a fully-functioning, interconnected, effective market, is a precondition for security of energy supply to Europe.\nSecurity of supply is thus a key strategic element that has to be improved by ensuring greater energy efficienc", "Decision on urgent procedure\nPresident\nThe next item is the vote on the use of the urgent procedure for the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a multi-annual recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean.\nPhilippe Morillon\nMadam President, ladies and gentlemen, the request for application of the urgent procedure put before us this morning, in implementation of Rule 134 of the Rules of Procedure, was submitted to us by the Council last week and relates, as you said, to the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a multi-annual recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean.\nThe aim of this proposal is to implement the new recovery plan, as recommended for these areas by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas at its meeting last November.\nAs the Council pointed out in its request for application of the urgent procedure, this regulation needs to come into force before the start of the main fishing season on 15 April, which means that the obligatory consultation of this Parliament needs to be carried out in this plenary session so as to pave the way for a political agreement within the Council in the coming weeks.\nIn view of this, and of the fact that the European Union needs to meet its international commitments and to do its part in the crucial efforts to deal with the acute crisis in bluefin tuna stocks, the European Parliament's Committee on Fisheries has unanimously approved this request for application of the urgent procedure. I therefore encourage you to confirm this approval in this morning's vote.\nJos\u00e9 Ribeiro e Castro\n(PT) Madam President, just a brief point of order about the agenda for this week. Wednesday 11 March is the European Day for the Victims of Terrorism. This day was proposed in the first place by Parliament in a vote that took place on 11 March 2004. We were then debating an assessment of the area of freedom, security and justice. It was the day of", "1. Dialogue between the Chinese government and Envoys of the Dalai Lama (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the dialogue between the Chinese Government and the Envoys of the Dalai Lama.\nErik Meijer \nauthor. - (NL) Mr President, it is no good thing that the world at large should have accepted for so long China's conception of Tibet as an integral part of itself. The Tibetans embody their own culture in inhospitable living conditions, isolated and high up in the mountains. For a long time, China has been unable to resist the temptation to consider that region as a fall-back that can absorb sections of its own very large population.\nThis is a problem not only for the people of Tibet, but also for those of the neighbouring and more readily accessible region of Xinjiang, home to the Uighurs, who are related to the Turkic-speaking peoples, such as the Kazaks, Kyrgyzs and Uzbeks. They fear becoming minorities in their own countries and losing everything that is dear to them. Moreover, we should certainly not idealise the traditional living conditions of Tibetans and Uighurs. Although sweeping changes are called for, these changes should not be imposed from outside or, what is more, serve outside interests.\nSince China is the world's most populated country and an up-and-coming economic power, it is extremely unlikely that Tibet will be given the opportunity to develop into an independent state. This makes it all the more important that, 50 years after the major conflict, there should be a reconciliation in which, within China, the Tibetans are allowed to retain the most valuable traits of their individuality and they no longer run the risk of becoming the victim of state violence. These days, the progress ideology that has dominated China for nearly 60 years is mainly focused on economic growth. Although this has drawbacks, it does offer more scope for tolerance and recognition of diversity than was the case for a long time. A d", "Preparations for Canc\u00fan Climate Change Conference (29 November-10 December) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on preparations for the Canc\u00fan Climate Change Conference (29 November-10 December).\nJoke Schauvliege\nMr President, honourable Members, following the conference in Copenhagen, the European Union decided quite quickly to proceed via a gradual, pragmatic approach in the future. Focusing on an 'all or nothing' approach is no longer possible. Gradually, the building blocks must be put in place for a post-2012 framework. We realise that progress on the negotiations on the creation of an ambitious regime to combat climate change beyond 2012 has been very slow. The participants have very widely differing perspectives, something that was evident just recently during the latest official negotiating round in Tianjin, at which very limited progress was made.\nHonourable Members, it was against this background that the Environment Council and the European Council put the finishing touches to the European Union position for the conference in Canc\u00fan. The positions of the other institutions, and naturally also your motion for a resolution, were noted in the process. It has already been established that Canc\u00fan will not produce a legally binding post-2012 framework. Given that the contents of the package of measures for Canc\u00fan are not yet clear, the European Union position, which will also offer the European negotiators the necessary flexibility, puts forward various elements. It is at all events clear that the package of measures for Canc\u00fan must be balanced, which means it must contain elements making it possible to accommodate both the developing and the developed countries. What, then, are the main elements of the EU's position?\nFirst and foremost, there is the need to achieve a balanced result; to balance negotiating rights in the context of the Kyoto Protocol and of the Convention on the one hand, and within the frameworks themselv", "Voting rights for non-citizens of Latvia in local elections (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on voting rights for 'non-citizens' of Latvia in local elections, by David Hammerstein, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Alexandra Dobolyi, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, Willy Meyer Pleite, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, and Marian Harkin, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe - B6-0007/2009).\nDavid Hammerstein\nMr President, there is a Member State of the European Union that uses the concept of 'non-citizens' to designate hundreds of thousands of people living in that country. The vast majority were born in that country, work in that country but nevertheless are given the epithet 'non-citizens'. This is an aberration in the European Union.\nThis is an aberration because the European Union is based on the concept of non-discrimination, on the principle of equality, which today is being negated in that country: it is failing to recognise those people's rights and is subjecting a group to historical discrimination purely on account of its ethnic origin. This is not acceptable.\nWe have examined specific cases in the Committee on Petitions. The first case was that of a man who came and said 'the first time I was able to vote was when I was studying in Germany. I was able to vote in German local elections, but in my own country I have not been able to vote because they do not recognise me. I do not have another passport. I do not have another country. I only have this country and I cannot vote.' That is an aberration.\nWe have dealt with another case in the Committee on Petitions concerning a man who has passed the language examinations in Latvia, who knows all the laws and who, nonetheless, is not granted citizenship because the state considers that - and I repeat what the Ambassador ", "Culture in a globalising world (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Vasco Gra\u00e7a Moura, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on a European agenda for culture in a globalising world.\nVasco Gra\u00e7a Moura\nrapporteur. - (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having proposed a general framework for cultural matters in the context of the Lisbon agenda, I decided to incorporate into my report the many proposals put forward by Members since they were in line with the general approach. Therefore, if the report contains some points that might seem redundant when set against other instruments already approved in the meantime and in force, they serve to emphasise the topics thought to be the most relevant.\nRecalling the main points of that framework, I would say that the European Union has a very special duty to safeguard Europe's cultural richness. The European cultural heritage, in all its dimensions, must, by every means, be preserved and disseminated both within and outside the Union, without denying the fact that it is wholly desirable to take as open an attitude as possible to every other culture, which has, moreover, always been the hallmark of Europe.\nOur cultural heritage, encompassing its diverse forms of expression and the combination of its founding sources, such as, Graeco-Latin and Judaeo-Christian antiquity, has, over the course of history, placed Europe in the vanguard of all the continents. It has proved to be an unrivalled driver of innovation, development and progress, which has spread in every direction, and today still constitutes an essential reference point for humanism, spiritual enrichment and enlivenment, democracy, tolerance, and citizenship.\nIn an increasingly globalised world, the outstanding specific qualities contained within the nucleus of Europe's cultural richness constitute genuine European added value and their identity-giving role is vital for Europe and the Union in that it helps them to underst", "Council Question Time\nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B6-0125/2007).\nThe following questions are addressed to the Council.\nSubject: EU taxation policy\nThe taxation policy pursued by the Member States should be consistent with the Community's objectives in terms of job creation, EU competitiveness, the single market and free movement of capital. The 27 Member States are solely responsible for the planning and implementation of direct taxation policy, while the Community rules governing individual areas of taxation policy in the Union require the unanimity of the 27 for any decision-making. Value added tax (VAT) on products has become quite a complicated matter in recent years. In particular, VAT in the Member States ranges from 3% in Luxembourg to 25% in Denmark. Will the Council say whether the EU is moving closer to adopting a common system for value added tax, what stage has been reached in discussions to date and what the Member States' intentions are concerning the adoption of a common rate of VAT?\nG\u00fcnter Gloser\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (DE) Madam President, the common system of value-added tax was established in 1967 by the first and second VAT Directives. These two directives prescribed the general structures of the system. The detailed provisions governing the application of the common VAT system were introduced in 1977 with the adoption of the sixth VAT Directive. This directive has since been subject to numerous amendments, most of which were occasioned by the creation of the single market and the accompanying removal of tax barriers between Member States.\nOn 1 January 2007 the sixth directive was repealed and replaced by Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value-added tax, which incorporates all of the statutory amendments to the original directive. As far as VAT rates are concerned, the directive establishes the principle of applying a standard rate plus one or two reduced rates. The standard rate must be at least 15%. Thi", "15. Together for Health: A Strategic Approach for the EU 2008-2013 (\n- Before the vote:\nAlojz Peterle\nrapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to inform you why I, as rapporteur, put seven minuses against the amendments of the Socialist Group. It was a question of my credibility because six of those seven amendments were refused in the ENVI Committee three weeks ago. There were no votes against, and I see no new reasons to change my opinion on this.\nThe other reason is that we adopted a resolution on safety at work in January and I think that this subject is well covered there. I have no problem with the contents, but I do not think there is any need to repeat some elements in different resolutions. In any case, in order to have an appropriate structure to the text, I would like to table the following oral amendment, in agreement with the shadow rapporteurs. Amendments 1, 3 and 4 are to be moved after paragraph 32, amendment 5 after recital M, and amendment 6 after recital Q. This is just the replacement of that.\nPresident\nTo summarise the situation, our rapporteur is not proposing an amendment to the text. He simply wants to ensure that after the vote the services reorganise the final text as he has just proposed.\n", "Cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is a short presentation of the report by Mr Medina Ortega, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters.\nManuel Medina Ortega\nrapporteur. - (ES) Madam President, at this late hour on a Monday the Commission will probably have other things on its mind more worrying than this report. To be brief, what we are doing is simply responding to a report by the Commission, which is a report on the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 of 28 May 2001 on cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters.\nThis sphere is, in fact, not a Community one, but an intergovernmental one, in which the Council - through the regulation - has tried to encourage cooperation between the courts. I believe, however, that there has been a certain lack of rigour on the European Union's part in its attempts to achieve this. That is to say, certain measures have been taken, such as the formulation of practical ideas, the use of electronic media, and so on, but I recognise that it is quite difficult for the Commission to act.\nI do not know what the Commission has achieved or what it hopes to achieve, but it seems to me quite difficult to achieve anything because of the huge difficulties involved in this form of intergovernmental cooperation. What we are asking is for the judicial authorities to collaborate, but we are talking about 27 countries, judicial authorities that use 22 different languages, with legal systems that have significant differences between them, and we are trying to achieve results.\nThe Commission has found that the results are not good, that there is a huge delay in the implementation of these cooperation mechanisms and, therefore, that we do not", "6. Small Business Act review (vote) \nNiki Tzavela\nMr President, we, the co-authors, all agreed to a compromise yesterday that reads as follows: 'Notes the growing illegal trade in all Member States in counterfeit and pirated products imported from third countries, which are threatening the competitiveness of European SMEs'.\nWe authors all agree to this.\n", "European Space Policy: How to bring space down to earth (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on:\nthe oral question to the Council (B6-0482/2008) by Mr Pribetich, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the European space policy: How to bring space down to earth, and\nthe oral question to the Commission (B6-0483/2008) by Mr Pribetich, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the European space policy: How to bring space down to earth.\nAs a native of Toulouse, I am delighted to chair this debate.\nPierre Pribetich\nauthor. - (FR) Mr President, Mr Vice-President, Minister, 'it is high time to rekindle the stars'.\nI wanted to begin my speech with this line from a Guillaume Apollinaire poem, to emphasise the importance for the European Parliament of relaunching its space policy.\nFor more than thirty years, the European Union and its Member States have worked together in financing, drawing up and developing space policy. Alas, this policy has progressively lost its luminescence and radiance.\nIt is true that in 2003, the foundations of a European space policy were set out by the EC-ESA framework agreement. It is also true that the 'Space' Council of 22 May 2007 was in line with the political continuum of this framework agreement. However, the light emitted by this star remains insufficient. For Europe's independence, its role on the international stage, its security and prosperity all come together to make this major policy an incomparable trump card for an industrial policy that creates both jobs and stimulates growth; an ambitious policy for cultural, economic and scientific influence that is reinforced on the international stage and is an essential vehicle for society to acquire the knowledge that we wish to gain.\nIn the institutional triangle of the Union, and to ensure that this does not turn into a Bermuda triangle, the European Parliament, on behalf of European citizens, must play an important and increased role", "4. Obligations of operators who place timber and timber products on the market (\nAfter the vote:\nCorien Wortmann-Kool\nMadam President, if you allow me, I would like to give a clarification on the PPE Group's voting list for all the supervisory package reports, which is that in the final vote on the legislative resolutions, all the PPE Group roll-call votes should be in favour. This is a clarification aimed at preventing any misunderstanding.\n", "Legal protection of designs (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 98/71/EC on the legal protection of designs - C6-0119/2004 -.\nCharlie McCreevy\nMember of the Commission. - Madam President, firstly I would like to warmly thank the Committee on Legal Affairs and the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, for the hard and excellent work he has carried out in the preparation of his report on the proposal to amend the Design Directive. I welcome the fact that this work has eventually allowed the committee to pave the way for liberalising the spare parts aftermarket in the whole Community.\nCurrently, there is a situation of different, opposed regimes of design protection, where 10 Member States have liberalised and 17 Member States extend design protection to spare parts. This situation is entirely unsatisfactory for the internal market. In the automotive sector, which is the sector most affected, there is a single market for cars but no single market for their spare parts. This leads to distortion of prices and obstacles to trade.\nThe proposed exclusion of design protection in the aftermarket for spare parts is the right and only effective way to achieve a single market in this area. The Commission's Extended Impact Assessment analysing the options to solve the problem demonstrates this.\nThe Commission's figures suggest that, currently, consumers are paying a 6% to 10% premium for these spare parts in Member States which provide for design protection. With the liberalisation, consumers will benefit directly from the increased competition and the completion of the internal market.\nThe independent distribution sector will be in a position to put a larger spectrum of parts on offer, including parts from original equipment suppliers, as well as the normally cheaper parts from independent producers. This will lead to more choice ", "EC/Guinea-Bissau Fisheries Partnership Agreement (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau - C6-0391/2007 -.\nJoe Borg\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, let me start by extending my gratitude to the Committee on Fisheries and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Capoulas Santos, for his report.\nOn 23 May 2007, the European Community and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau initialled a fisheries partnership agreement for a period of four years. This agreement forms part of the series of EC 'tuna agreements' in the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe financial contribution is fixed at EUR 7 million per year. Of this financial contribution, 35%, or EUR 2.45 million, is earmarked to support the definition and implementation of a fisheries sector policy in Guinea-Bissau, with a view to introducing responsible and sustainable fishing. In addition, the European Union will pay an annual specific contribution of EUR 500 000 to improve sanitary conditions in the fisheries sector and to strengthen monitoring, control and surveillance in the waters of Guinea-Bissau.\nIn addition to the total amount of EUR 7.5 million, the protocol also contains a special financial provision for a supplementary allocation of EUR 1 million maximum per year, aiming at improving the use of fishing opportunities by ship owners.\nThis new protocol provides fishing possibilities for shrimps and for fish, in particular cephalopods, up to a total tonnage of 4 400 t per year for each of the two categories. Furthermore, the agreement covers licences for 19 tuna seiners, 14 pole-and-line vessels and 4 surface longliners.\nThe agreement gives the Community a solid legal and political framework for monitoring the activities of the European Union fleet in the Guinea-Bissau fishing area.

May we be successful in promoting peace in the world. I would now like to make a statement.\n", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of the last sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nM\u00e9ndez de Vigo\nMadam President, I do not see my name amongst those who voted for the final resolution on maize. I would like it shown that I intended to vote in favour, like my group.\n\nPresident\nThat will be corrected.\n(Parliament approved the Minutes.)\n\nBudget discharge\nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following reports:\nA4-0124/97 by Mr Wynn, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control on the Commission report (COM(97)0048 - C4-0108/97) on the measures taken to follow up the observations contained in the European Parliament's resolution accompanying the discharge decision in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Communities for the 1994 financial year; -A4-0120/97 by Mr Wynn, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, giving discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Communities for the 1995 financial year - Section III; -A4-0125/97 by Mr Dankert, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, giving discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Communities for the 1995 financial year - Sections I, IV, V and VI; -A4-0071/97 by Mr Blak, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, giving discharge to the Commission in respect of the management of the European Coal and Steel Community for the 1995 financial year; -A4-0121/97 by Mr B\u00f6sch, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, giving discharge to the Commission in respect of the management of the sixth and seventh European Development Funds for the 1995 financial year.I should like to extend a warm welcome to Mr Friedmann, the President of the Court of Auditors.\n\nWynn\nMadam President, it is nice to see so many people here for the discharge debate. I am amazed at how many people have an interest in this. No doubt in two minute", "A new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe (debate) \nPresident\nThe first item is the report by Mr Garriga Polledo, on behalf of the Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013, on Investing in the future: a new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe.\nSalvador Garriga Polledo\nMr President, Commissioner Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, we have had 23 years of financial perspectives, four distinct periods that have helped EU expenditure and income to evolve in a well-ordered way. The existence of the financial perspectives is what has allowed the Union's programmes to be carried out. This is why this debate and the vote following it are so important to the Union's finances. Parliament is taking the political initiative in Europe's budget for the first time. The Commission and the Council will have to react to this proposal and put forward their alternatives.\nParliament has drafted a proposal that is defined by consensus and collaboration. It has involved one year of work, 1 100 amendments and 120 commitments, with 11 parliamentary committees and 10 national parliaments having contributed to it. I would like to congratulate all the officials and assistants who have worked over the past year to make this report possible.\nThere has also been institutional cooperation from the College of Commissioners, headed by Jos\u00e9 Manuel Dur\u00e3o Barroso, with the Commissioner for Financial Programming and Budget, Janusz Lewandowski, having provided particular support. We hope that the proposal they put forward on 29 June will be in line with the recommendations made in our report.\nWe can no longer carry on making more Europe with a smaller budget. We want an end to the bad habit of accepting solemn political commitments that cannot possibly be funded. We have had enough experience on this issue with the Lisbon strategy", "Statistics on plant protection products (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Staes, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning statistics on plant protection products - C6-0457/2006 -.\nJoaqu\u00edn Almunia\nMember of the Commission. - (ES) Madam President, I would of course like to thank Mr Staes for his excellent work as rapporteur, as well as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for their contributions to the debate on this proposal for a regulation.\nThe proposal is part of the Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides. The aim of this thematic strategy is to reduce the impact of pesticides on human health and the environment. The proposal for a regulation that we are dealing with today contributes to this aim by ensuring that reliable and comparable data is collected in all the Member States, in order to enable harmonised risk indicators to be calculated. The Commission's proposal is the fruit of years of work with the OECD and with research bodies on developing these risk indicators.\nOur initial intention in the Commission was to cover all types of pesticides, including biocides. However, the preparatory phase of the legislation made it clear that the biocides sector is not very harmonised and neither the Commission nor the Member States have sufficient experience or knowledge to propose specific measures on biocides, therefore the decision was not to include this category of products in the initial proposal that has been presented for your consideration.\nI know that in his report Mr Staes advocates the inclusion of biocides, but we had reasons for finally deciding not to include them. I would, however, like to assure the rapporteur and all of you that the Commission will take the opportunity offered by the review of the Directive on ", "Order of business\nPresident\nThe final draft agenda for this part-session, as laid down by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 3 June 2008 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed. The following amendments have been requested to this draft.\nMonday/Tuesday/Wednesday: No change.\nThursday: The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has requested that the first sub-item of the debate on human rights in the afternoon, 'Allegation of mass graves in Indian-administered Kashmir', be deleted from the agenda.\nThe Chair of the PSE Group, Mr Schulz, has the floor to explain the request.\nMartin Schulz\nMr President, I had already tried at the Conference of Presidents to convince the chairs of the groups that this agenda item is totally inappropriate at this particular time. It is based on mere supposition by Amnesty International. According to Amnesty International itself, there is a suspicion, but no tangible proof of the existence of these mass graves as yet.\nThe Chair of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, Mrs Flautre, responded to this very intelligently. She invited representatives of Amnesty International to visit the committee on 16 July to substantiate and define the accusations. Therefore we believe that it makes a lot of sense to wait until this hearing has taken place before we decide what to do about this agenda item.\nIn addition, I should like to point out that this is not just any old region but a part of the world in which the European Parliament too, as an international political entity, must proceed with scrupulous care, and not make decisions based on assumptions that could perhaps trigger the opposite of what we intend, which is to achieve more stability in the region.\nTherefore, we request that this item be removed from the agenda.\nMonica Frassoni\non behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, in the debate that we are going to have - I hope - we will be asking for an independent inquiry into the mas", "Explanations of vote\nWritten explanations of vote\nDavid Casa  \nin writing. - As a result of judgments by the Court of Justice in the Open Skies cases, the Commission allowed for the replacement of bilateral agreements that had been entered into between some Member States and third countries with Community agreements. The Commission has therefore negotiated an agreement that will replace the bilateral agreements between Mongolia and certain EU Member States.\nNuno Teixeira  \nThis proposal is aimed at replacing certain provisions of bilateral air service agreements concluded in the past by EU Member States and the Government of Mongolia, and deals with aspects that I consider crucial, including technical issues, taxation of fuel, and pricing.\nI particularly welcome the importance granted to compliance with Community competition law, since some provisions in earlier bilateral agreements were clearly anti-competitive. I therefore endorse Mr Simpson's report since it follows these general guidelines.\nDavid Casa  \nin writing. - When Romania and Bulgaria entered the EU, it was specified in their act of accession that a protocol would have to be drawn up amending the Agreement on Maritime Transport between the EU and its Member States and China. This vote is in favour of the conclusion of this protocol.\nLu\u00eds Paulo Alves  \nI voted in favour of the report on mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund in favour of France because I believe this fund helps countries to respond effectively and flexibly to situations created by natural disasters, in this case the storm last January which affected south-western France, causing severe damage. This financial instrument of solidarity is mobilised in cases where the damage caused by a disaster is so severe that national resources are insufficient to respond effectively to the crisis, the aim being to stimulate economic recovery and meet the needs of the Member State affected.\nJean-Pierre Audy  \nI voted in favour of the report by my esteemed", "Adoption by Estonia of the euro on 1 January 2011 (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Edward Scicluna, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on adoption by Estonia of the euro on 1 January 2011 - 2010/0135(NLE)).\nEdward Scicluna\nrapporteur. - Madam President, I am pleased to be able to present this report endorsing Estonia's application to join the eurozone.\nIt is very significant that a small, but highly determined, EU Member State comes knocking on the eurozone's door during such difficult times. It says a lot about the country and it says a lot about the euro and the eurozone as well.\nThe reason why Estonia should join the eurozone is straightforward. Estonia has met the Maastricht criteria laid down in the treaties. More importantly, we need to keep in mind that these achievements were reached during the worst global financial, economic and social crisis we have seen in our lifetimes. Such achievements, it must be said, are the result of determined, credible and sustained efforts by successive Estonian governments and the Estonian people. Moreover, despite the eurozone's recent difficulties, public opinion in Estonia is strongly in favour of joining the euro.\nAs rapporteur, I have been in constant contact with the Commission, the European Central Bank and the Estonian Government and visited Estonia in the middle of May when the Commission and the ECB published their convergence reports. The preparations made by the Estonian Finance Ministry, Parliament and Statistical Office and the Central Bank are a credit to Estonia.\nI must raise my concern, however, at the extremely short time that Parliament is being given to present its report following the publication of these convergence reports. I do not think it is appropriate. As has been stated in the past, it demonstrates a lack of respect for Parliament. I admit that there have been some noticeable improvements, as when the Central Bank and the Commission met with the Bureau an", "Statement by the President\nPresident\nI would like to notify you that this morning a suspect package was found near the Louise Weiss Building and that the French police, in collaboration with our security services, denied access to the building and carried out a test which, fortunately, proved to be negative.\n\nWatson\nThose of us who were in the building before 8 o'clock were very much aware that there was a suspect package in the courtyard of the Louise Weiss Building which was the cause of a bomb scare. Quite rightly, access to certain parts of the building was denied and Members and staff were evacuated from one part to another. I do not know whether this was a fiendish attempt by my Italian friend Mr Dell'Alba to move us from Strasbourg, whether it was my UK Conservative colleagues who had mistaken the day of President Chirac's visit, or whether it was a Christmas gift of Belgian chocolates now sticking to the walls of the courtyard. But, whatever the case, there was a lot of confusion and an evident lack of knowledge of the procedures for the evacuation of this building. I should like to ask whether a note could be circulated to Members and staff outlining normal evacuation procedures and whether, in the case of an event like this, the screens which are dotted all around the building could be used to give Members information on what is going on.\n\nPresident\nMr Watson, I think that your request is not only justifiable but sacrosanct and we must ask our services to organise a drill as soon as possible, as soon as we are all here for a plenary sitting. Hopefully, we need only wait two or three months for the temperature and weather to allow us to carry out this drill in the best possible way.\nI would also like to inform you that what was found was not an item belonging to Mr Dell' Alba or his friends, but is definitely a piece of equipment belonging to a photographer. This was revealed after it was found. However, when it was first discovered, there was some uncertai", "Explanations of vote\nJaroslav Pa\u0161ka\n(SK) The adopted draft resolution of the European Parliament on the second European Summit on Roma opens a new path for resolving the problems of the Roma population in the European Union.\nIt has become apparent that the individual efforts of various countries to settle the integration of the Roma into society have not produced a satisfactory result. The causes of this situation are varied. I therefore welcome the efforts of the European Union to get involved in solving the problem of the Roma and to improve the integration of this community into society in an organised way.\nNicole Sinclaire\nMr President, while I deplore discrimination against any group in society on whatever grounds, I cannot support this resolution. However, this resolution seeks to place the responsibility for fighting discrimination into the EU context whereas I would argue that attitudes and approaches in Member States are so varied that the interests of minority groups would be better addressed by Member States and particularly by those Member States who do not share the ideal of tolerance and equality that we British take for granted.\nI am aware, for example, that one Italian MEP, a member of the EFD Group, has been prosecuted for taking part in a vigilante raid in which he set fire to the belongings of an immigrant. This is unacceptable. Please do not associate the British people with such behaviour by suggesting that minority groups in our country need the same levels of protection as the same poor soul that I have just referred to.\nFrank Vanhecke\n(NL) Mr President, it is a matter of fact that anyone who denies a problem, who denies the truth, will obviously be unable to solve that problem. That is a fact. We ought to be aware that, with our resolution on the Roma in Europe, which is a document full of politically correct nonsense, we will not be able to come up with or offer a single solution because what we are doing is denying the problem. We should, f", "Murder of women in Mexico and Central America\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the report (\u03916-0338/2007) by Ra\u00fcl Romeva i Rueda, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on the murders of women in Central America and Mexico, and the role of the EU in fighting this phenomenon (2007/2025(\u0399\u039d\u0399)).\nRa\u00fcl Romeva i Rueda  \nrapporteur. - (ES) Madam President, although the murder of women is a global problem, there are areas of the world that, due to both the magnitude and the complexity of the phenomenon, have become paradigmatic cases.\nThose places are also, very regrettably, mirrors that reflect many of the problems that, to varying degrees, affect societies governed by social patterns based on a patriarchal culture. This is the case, for example, with Mexico and the countries of Central America.\nIn fact, it was in Mexico where the concept of feminicide began to take shape, especially when the Special Prosecution Service for investigating and prosecuting cases of feminicide in the Republic of Mexico, chaired by the congresswoman Marcela Lagarde, established that the concept referred to, and I quote, 'the sum total of crimes against humanity consisting of criminal acts, kidnappings and disappearances affecting girls and women in a context of institutional collapse'.\nIn short, it is a breakdown in the rule of law that promotes impunity. Although the concept is in the progress of being developed, some advocate the use of the term 'feminicide' in order to contrast it with the term 'homicide'...\nI would like to ask for a little quiet in the House.\nrapporteur. - (ES) Thank you, Madam President. I will continue.\nI was saying that, although the concept is one that is constantly evolving, in fact some feel it is necessary to talk about feminicide in order to contrast it with the concept of homicide, and it is significant that what it highlights is the existence of one of the most alarming phenomena of our time: the murder of women for the simple reas", "Import of poultry carcases (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on the import of poultry carcases.\nAndroula Vassiliou\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, on this issue I had exhaustive discussions with my colleagues on the authorisation of the use of AMT substances as a decontamination measure to clean the surface of poultry carcases, during the college meeting of 28 May. As you know, the possibility of removing surface contamination with substances other than potable water was approved by Council and Parliament in 2004 in the hygiene regulations.\nIn order to approve substances for use in decontamination of any meat, the applicable law requires a positive, evidence-based finding in comitology, indicating that the use of the substances does not pose risks to health or the environment.\nLet me remind you that there was a long-standing request by the USA for approval of four AMT substances for use in decontamination of poultry carcases. Against this background, we have requested various scientific opinions which have assessed the risk of the use of the four AMT substances from the point of view of health, environment and anti-microbial resistance.\nOn the basis of the outcome of the various scientific opinions, we decided to present a proposal. The scientific opinions allow us to proceed with a proposal for authorisation, but not at any price. Pursuant to the scientific opinions, a number of risk-management conditions had to be formulated. In proposing this text, my bottom line is very clear: no matter which commercial partner is at stake, no international commitment can be allowed to undermine the principles of food safety and the health of EU consumers.\nHence the need to ensure that any use of such substances would not replace the obligation to comply with the hygiene conditions along the food chain as set by Community legislation, and that such use would not make up for prior poor hygiene conditions. In fact, in its opinion, EFSA has ind", "Question Hour with the President of the Commission\nPresident\nThe next item is the Question Hour with the President of the Commission.\nOpen questions\nCorien Wortmann-Kool\nMr President, expectations of EU 2020 are running high, not only in our group but also among European citizens. They expect prosperity, jobs and a sustainable, innovative social market economy by 2020, as well as specific proposals for strong SMEs and an open European single market, including in the field of capital and knowledge development. They expect a 2020 strategy with a solid, transparent European governance structure, with no free-for-all for Member States.\nMr President, what Parliament wants is not merely to be informed after the event about proposals by the Commission and the Council; it wants to actually participate in developing and implementing the 2020 strategy. How are you going to ensure this, and what timetable are you working to? The Council President has announced that the intention is to reach conclusions as early as March. Will you take the initiative? Can we expect a specific framework in the near future containing starting points and objectives as a basis for participation by Parliament in this discussion? Can you let us know what timetable you are working to and who is responsible? Are you Mr 2020?\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso\nPresident of the Commission. - As President of the Commission, I will be responsible for that, in coordination with my colleagues in the Commission, because this will be the central task for the next Commission, as was presented in my political guidelines. Regarding the timing, we hope to have a formal communication ready in time for the Spring Council, but I feel it would be better only to have the formal conclusions at the June Council. That will be my proposal to the European Council, so that we can have - and I very much wish for this - full participation and ownership for Parliament of the strategy.\nAt European Council level, there has also been a very inte", "Acts of terrorism in the United States\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, I open this extraordinary meeting with the emotion and the sadness that this horrific event, the scale of which would have seemed inconceivable, inspires in us all.\nThe purpose of this meeting is first of all to demonstrate our solidarity with the American people, who have just been struck by a barbaric act of terrorism, to show our compassion for the victims, for the final toll will certainly be appalling, and to demonstrate our support for all those who are working tirelessly to save what further lives they can. Yesterday, I expressed this solidarity to President Bush, on my own behalf and on behalf of the entire European Parliament and gave him my assurance that the people of Europe are standing shoulder to shoulder with the United States in the tragic ordeal the American nation is suffering. When terrorism strikes in a Member State of the European Union we all feel concerned, and these appalling attacks inspire in me the same feeling of disgust and indignation. Today, we share the pain of the American people. It is the United States, that great democracy which did so much to help Europe protect its freedom that has just been attacked, but a blow has also been dealt to the sacrosanct values of life and democracy.\nThe date of 11 September 2001 will remain forever engraved on the memory of humanity. This tragedy calls for a calm reaction on our part but also for the closest cooperation between all countries that reject terrorism so that the perpetrators of these abominable crimes and those who have supported them can be identified, pursued, arrested and tried and so that blind terrorism can, at last, be eradicated from the surface of the globe. It also requires the international community to commit itself to finding a peaceful solution to the conflicts that nourish and sustain fanaticism. Over and above statements, over and above the common response to terrorism that we hope and pray for, all pl", "One-minute speeches on matters of political importance (continuation) \nPresident\nWe now continue with the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.\nJ\u00f6rg Leichtfried\n(DE) Mr President, in times of climate change and global warming, this much is obvious: we must reduce greenhouse gas emissions and we must save energy. The EU is already trying to lead the way in this field, sometimes with more and sometimes with less success. At times, there are also apparent attempts to throw the baby out with the bathwater, as in the case of the so-called Ecodesign Directive.\nIn my constituency, there is a very successful business, called Austria Email AG, which manufactures electric boilers. This is particularly practical and useful in Austria, as the majority of our electricity comes from hydroelectric power, and is therefore very environmentally friendly.\nIt now appears that the Ecodesign Directive will ban these boilers in the future, and instead force people to use either gas storage heaters or gas stoves, which in my view makes no sense, as they are far less environmentally friendly than these boilers. In addition to this, 400 jobs are currently at risk in Austria.\nThis is not what we are trying to achieve. It is a negative development. If we are to protect the environment, then we should surely take measures that are reasonable, beneficial and, above all, appropriate. However, we should not risk jobs for the sake of a product that does not really seem expedient.\nV\u00e9ronique De Keyser\n(FR) Mr President, for us, Euronews is a remarkable window on the world, and it is a channel I am very keen on, but I often wonder about the content of its advertisements.\nWhen I switched on the television this morning I saw an advert for Macedonia. And what did I read? 'A tax-haven for businesses, average wage EUR 370, 10% income tax' etc.\nIf this is how Macedonia intends to present its application to join the European Union, and if I ask people in my region, 'Do you want Macedonia to", "Combating cancer in the enlarged EU (debate) \nPresident\n(PT) The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on combating cancer in the enlarged European Union, by Miroslav Ouzk\u00fd, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety - B6-0015/2008).\nCommissioner Vassiliou is with us for the first time to take part in this debate. Welcome, Commissioner; I hope you will feel at home among us. Your speech, when the moment comes, will mark the beginning of your cooperation and collaboration with the European Parliament.\nMiroslav Ouzk\u00fd\nauthor. - (CS) First of all, I would like to take this opportunity, as the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, to congratulate the Commissioner, who was nominated and appointed to the Commission today. Although serious reasons prevented me from listening to her presentation in person, I must say that she made an excellent impression on the members of my committee and was unanimously welcomed in her new capacity.\nRegarding the oral question, I would like to begin by explaining what made us tackle this issue and ask individual states to pay more attention to this serious diagnosis. You probably know, from the emphasis in the report and in the question, that cancer cases in Europe are on the increase. There are a number of reasons for this: as we know, the population is ageing and more and more people are exposed to carcinogens. According to the trade unions, at least 8% of annual cancer deaths are directly caused by exposure to carcinogens in the workplace. We have to bear in mind that one in three Europeans is diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime and one in four Europeans dies from the disease.\nAnother important matter is the significant differences in cancer treatment success rates between the old and new Member States. This imbalance is surely also food for thought. What can we do in this area and what can we recommend to the European Community?

Information on medicinal products (Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products) (\nBefore the vote on Amendment 13:\nChristofer Fjellner\nrapporteur. - Mr President, I have a small oral amendment as the result of a last-minute compromise among groups and that is to Amendment 13 where the text as it stands right now is 'within 60 days after receipt of the notification'. That should be changed to 'within 90 days after receipt of the notification'.\nThis has been agreed among all the political groups.\n", "Climate and energy package and maritime transport package (signature of acts) \nPresident\nMr Deputy Prime Minister and representative of the Presidency of the European Union, Mr Ne\u010das, Commissioner Rehn, honourable rapporteurs and committee chairmen, ladies and gentlemen.\nToday we have the pleasure of jointly signing two important packages, the climate and energy package and the package for an integrated maritime policy for the European Union. This is the high point of the consistent work which we have carried out with the Council and the Commission. In adopting these two legislative projects, the European Union is proving that it is able to act decisively in order to jointly overcome the challenges in the core sectors of sustainable development, environmental protection and safety at sea. This public signing will help to emphasise the importance of European legislation to European citizens.\nIn the climate and energy package, Parliament and the Council have laid the basis for the European Union to achieve its climate targets by 2020 and to continue to play a leading role in the fight against climate change. The climate package includes important legal frameworks which will help, for example, to improve the emissions trading system or efforts by Member States to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and also to promote renewable energies or carbon storage techniques. The rapporteurs Mrs Doyle and Mrs Hassi are here with us, or so I assumed; at least I can see Mrs Hassi.\nThis package will give the European Union the necessary credibility in the run-up to the international conference due to take place in Copenhagen in December and during negotiations on a comprehensive and binding agreement.\nAs far as maritime transport is concerned, Parliament and the Council reached agreement on eight dossiers during the course of conciliation. That is the result of intensive work lasting over three years.\nThis outcome is also proof of the strong pressure exerted by the European Parlia", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nSyed Kamall\nMadam President, whatever one thinks of the current debate on climate change - and I can sense a lot of hot air all around me - I think we can all agree on the need for more energy efficiency.\nBut, if we are going to talk about energy efficiency, let us make sure that we actually have some joined-up thinking on this. I will give an example: our whole policy on energy-saving light bulbs. Yes, we want to phase out existing light bulbs, but yet we impose tariffs on the import of energy-saving light bulbs. Yes, we talk about banning mercury in barometers (even though it actually constitutes a very small risk), yet at the same time we are encouraging energy-saving light bulbs which contain, yes, you guessed it, more mercury. Not only that, but we are talking about energy efficiency, yet we continue to come to Strasbourg, which emits tonnes and tonnes of needless extra CO2.\nTherefore, if we really want to take a lead on energy efficiency, we should close down the Strasbourg Parliament.\nBernard Wojciechowski\n(PL) Mr President, I voted in favour of Community participation in a research and development programme aimed at enhancing the quality of life of older people through the use of new information and communication technologies. The project provides development opportunities not only for older people but also for the handicapped, women bringing up children at home and people living in rural areas. In my view, this initiative will prevent social stratification in Europe in the area of access to digital services, as well as the marginalisation of social groups threatened by less access to modern technology. However, it is very important to bear in mind that the cost of these technologies must be kept as low as possible.\nCzes\u0142aw Adam Siekierski\n(PL) I voted in favour of the report on \"enhancing the quality of life of older people\u201d, which deals with issues of major importance for many European citizens, especially the", "\n\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the World Bank. \nNicolas Schmit,\n\u00a0\u00a0 .  Mr\u00a0President, I can indeed confirm, in the context of this Council statement on the World Bank, that the World Bank plays a very significant role at global level in the field of development financing. It is clear that the political and administrative management of the World Bank is thus an extremely important subject. However, as a representative of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, I am unfortunately not able to set out a position on behalf of the Council, or to report on the work carried out by the Council on this matter.\nIndeed, the EU itself \u00a0and I would say that this, too, is unfortunate\u00a0 has no part in the policy-making or operation of the World Bank. It is therefore down to the Member States of the EU that are also members of the bodies of the World Bank to set out their position with regard to the Bank. For this reason, the Council has not taken a position on the matters in question, because it has no authority to do so. None of the bodies of the Council have discussed a strategy for the World Bank, or the coordination of a possible common European position in this regard, or the decision-making procedures within that institution.\nI would also like to add that the Member States are working to coordinate their positions in order to have greater weight within the international institutions, including the international financial institutions such as the World Bank; this exercise does not, however, involve the Council as an institution since, as I said, the Community has no competence in this field.\nIt is also true that Mr\u00a0Wolfowitz, who has been nominated for the post of President of the World Bank, came to Brussels, where he met the President of the Ecofin Council, Mr\u00a0Juncker, and the representatives of the other European governors of the Bank. At this purely informal meeting, the future strategy of the World Bank in relation to d", "Public service broadcasting in the digital era: the future of the dual system (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Ivo Belet, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on public service broadcasting in the digital era: the future of the dual system.\nIvo Belet\nMadam President, good evening Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution which we hope to adopt here on Thursday sends, in my view, a very important signal, a signal which demonstrates that there is a great deal of support in this House for our typical European media model, which gives space to both commercial broadcasters, on the one hand, and public broadcasters, that is, public media companies, on the other. This model, Madam President, is typically European, because you will not, or only very occasionally, find it in the United States or Japan, let alone in China. In most Member States of the European Union, this dual media model has proved to offer the best guarantees when it comes to media pluralism, independence of editorials and freedom of the press in general. However, this model is, unfortunately, coming under heavy pressure in the European Union. That pressure is coming from various quarters. It is coming through the heavy cuts that competent authorities, national or regional, are facing, but there is also a great deal of pressure from private media companies on public broadcasters. They consider public broadcasters to be representative of unfair competition, especially on the Internet. As a result of this overall situation, public broadcasters in a number of Member States of the European Union are actually struggling to keep their heads above water. This is calling into question the delicate balance of the dual system which is being compromised. We have to do everything we can to ensure that our European media model remains intact in these turbulent times and that we give it a firm foundation for the future, too. A number of interventions are needed for t", "Vote on requests for urgent procedure\nPresident. -\nI now give the floor to Mr Katiforis, who will speak on behalf of the committee responsible, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.\nKatiforis (PSE). Madam President, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has considered how we should continue to work on this directive after we rejected the Commission proposal in the last plenary by a considerable majority. According to the regulation, we have two months in which to deliberate and then come up with a reply.\nThe Economic Committee has given me until Monday to complete my negotiations with colleagues, the Commission and the Presidency. From what I see, there is no urgency in the matter because in any case the political agreement supposedly reached in Council on the matter is not set to begin before July. There is therefore plenty of time for negotiation and for making contacts, and 15 January - when we shall reply - is not too far away. Therefore, I see no particular need for urgent procedure and my proposal is that we reject the urgency request.\n(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)\nProposal for a Council decision on an exchange of letters between the European Community and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) concerning additional funding in 2001 under the current EC-UNRWA Convention for the years 1999-2001[COM(2001) 741 - C5-0663/2001 - 2001/0288(CNS)]\nPresident.

The entire primary class of children born in 1996 was killed under the rubble of that disaster. Many of the families are now left homeless with winter approaching.\nAll natural disasters and tragic events provoke in us a response of sympathy and kindred feeling for those who have suffered. On this occasion, however, throughout Europe and further afield, people were deeply touched at the tragic loss of the lives of so many young children.\nOn behalf of the European Parliament I have expressed our sympathy and condolences to the Mayor of San Giuliano di Puglia, to the President of the region of Molise and to the families of the victims. I invite you now to observe a minute's silence in their memory.\n(The House rose and observed one minute's silence)\n\nPresident. -\nI also regret to inform the House that this morning a Luxair plane flying from Berlin to Luxembourg crashed in Niederanven on its approach to Luxembourg Airport, carrying 19 passengers and three crew. The initial reports suggest that as many as 17 people have died in this tragic accident.\nEarlier this morning in France, a train en route from Paris to Vienna caught fire near Nancy. Twelve people lost their lives in this tragic accident. I would like to inform you that on my own behalf and in the name of the European Parliament, I have expressed to the Luxembourg and French authorities our solidarity with and deepest sympathy for the families of all those involved in these tragic accidents.\nI would also like to inform the House that I have written a letter to the ", "Question Time (Commission) \nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B7-0316/2010).\nThe following questions are addressed to the Commission.\nPart one\n\nSubject: Selection criteria for senior management and high-profile executives in Joint Technology Initiatives (JTI), and support for SMEs\nGiven that a number of public-private partnerships (PPPs), particularly Joint Technology Initiatives (JTIs), are being established under FP7, and that they will manage a significant part of the EU budget in an autonomous way (e.g. Hydrogen EUR 470 million), I would like to know:\nwhether the procedure for the selection of the JTIs' senior executive managers guarantees independence from the influence of large companies, both in the selection process itself and as regards the CVs of the senior managers selected;\nwhether, in those selection processes, the EU commitment to supporting SMEs is taken into account, given that SMEs will be the cornerstone of future industrial development in Europe.\nM\u00e1ire Geoghegan-Quinn\nMember of the Commission. - The first part of Mrs Guti\u00e9rrez-Cortines' question refers to whether the procedure for the selection of the JTI's senior executive managers guarantees independence from the influence of large companies.\nThe answer is 'yes'. The procedure for selecting the executive directors for joint technology initiatives follows the guidelines for the appointment of heads of community agencies and joint undertakings. The guidelines are applied to all EU bodies and hence ensure that JTI selection processes are fully coherent with those of other EU bodies such as executive agencies and regulatory agencies. In this way, the process for all EU bodies, including JTIs, is based on competence and merit and guarantees equal treatment to all candidates.\nIn this respect, as was prescribed in the guidelines, Commission senior staff members were a majority both in the pre-selection committees and during the proceedings of the Consultative Committee on Appointments.

Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ) 2007 (vote) \n- Before the vote on Amendment 1\nManfred Weber\n(DE) Mr President, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, may I move an oral amendment for the reformulation of Amendment 1. Before doing so, let me say that the report from Mr Deprez and the entire committee is excellent, and the PPE-DE Group would like to vote in favour of it. We do, however, have one key point, which is the question of voting rights for migrants in the European Union, not because we reject enfranchisement in general but because we take the view that subsidiarity should apply to such decisions. Electoral law is not a European matter.\nFor this reason, we would like to build a bridge to the amendment by proposing that it be reworded. We ask our fellow Members in the other groups to support the new wording so that we can all approve this good report.\nThe new wording reads as follows:\n'a proposal concerning the integration of long-term residents into the political life at European and local level; a step forward which could help the social, cultural and political integration of these long-term residents;'.\n(DE) I ask for your support.\nPresident\nI see there are objections.\n(The oral amendment was not adopted)\n", "2. Human rights in Syria\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on human rights in Syria.\nV\u00e9ronique De Keyser \nauthor. - (FR) Mr President, my interest in Syrian affairs is common knowledge; I have always taken the view that isolating that country would do no good at the international level and would do nothing to advance peace in the region, and it is for that reason that I am a supporter of the plan for an association agreement, which has been put on ice ever since the assassination of Rafiq Hariri. Commitment to Syria and friendship with it also imply, however, that we do not mince our words when fundamental rights are violated, and that is why I take a critical line on, and indeed denounce, the political repression under which all the opposition, of whatever tendency, currently labour.\nMost of the prisoners for whose release we are calling today are people we have met; they are almost friends, and none of them, when speaking with us, talked in terms of recourse to any means other than legal and peaceful ones in democratising the country that they all love passionately. When a country turns on those who love it passionately, when it stifles freedom of expression, it puts itself in danger, and I would not want to see Syria doing that to itself.\nToday, we are calling for the release of Michel Kilo, Mahmoud Issa, Suleiman Achmar, Faek El Mir, Aref Dalila, Kamal al-Labwani and Anouar Bunni, who must be set at liberty. I would therefore appreciate it if the Council and the Commission were to pass this message on to the Syrian Government and if that body were to give it a very great deal of attention, for the message is a serious one.\nMoreover, it would be good if Syria were to firmly declare itself in favour of there being an international criminal tribunal under Chapter 6 to try Hariri's assassins; the international community would appreciate such a gesture, which would facilitate an exit from the political stalemate with which Lebanon i", "One-minute speeches on matters of political importance\nPresident\nThe next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance (Rule 150 of the Rules of Procedure).\nGeorgios Papastamkos\n(EL) Mr President, apart from the pressure from financial quanta, the insecurity in the euro area ...\n(The President cut off the speaker and asked for order in the House)\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, please do not talk in the Chamber during the plenary sitting unless you can do so quietly.

Flawed European economic governance reacted, in my opinion, too late. Of course we need financial equilibrium in Europe.\nAt the same time, now is the time for European political union to direct economic union via a global crisis exit strategy and to introduce a more effective regulatory framework for operating the financial markets and for protecting the euro against speculative pressures. I refer, for example, to the need to revise the directive on market abuse. By the same token, I repeat my proposal to create a European credit rating authority.\nTeresa Jim\u00e9nez-Becerril Barrio\n(ES) Mr President, I would like to take the opportunity in this House today, as I was unable to do so on the 'European Day for the Victims of Terrorism' on 11 March, to pay a well-deserved tribute to these victims in recognition of the enormous sacrifice made by those who have paid the ultimate price in the name of freedom.\nWe urgently need to start to work on a directive to protect the rights of th", "Common rules for access to the international market for coach and bus services (recast) - Common rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator - Common rules for access to the international road haulage market (recast) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on\nthe recommendation for second reading from the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the common position of the Council with a view to the adoption of the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for access to the international market for coach and bus services (recast) (11786/1/2008 - C6-0016/2009 - (Rapporteur: Mathieu Grosch),\nthe recommendation for second reading from the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing common rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator and repealing Council Directive 96/26/EC (11783/1/2008 - C6-0015/2009 - (Rapporteur: Silvia-Adriana \u0162ic\u0103u), and\nthe recommendation for second reading from the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for access to the international road haulage market (recast) (11788/1/2008 - C6-0014/2009 - (Rapporteur: Mathieu Grosch).\nMathieu Grosch\nMr President, I assume that this is a joint debate on the three reports forming part of the road package.\nI should like to thank the Council, and also the Commission staff. The work we have done over the last two years has produced good results.\nRoad and freight transport within the European area accounts for approximately 75% of transport and employs two million people. Certain new rules were called for in view of the market opening for 25 countries that is planned for Ma", "The Bologna Process and student mobility (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Doris Pack, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the Bologna Process and student mobility.\nDoris Pack\nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I do hope the fact that we are once again meeting in camera this evening does not imply anything about our basic attitude to education.\nThe Bologna Process is truly the most radical reform of higher education in recent years. The flow of knowledge should surely not stop at national boundaries any more in this day and age. This is why it is also essentially gratifying that the Member States and the universities are prepared to work together on this matter, regardless of the subsidiarity principle they always prize so highly. I welcome that, but I also note that all the parliaments have been bypassed in this matter. The European Parliament was not contacted, nor were any of the 46 national parliaments.\nThe galling thing is that we Members of Parliament are constantly being asked out there about this Bologna Process. If anything goes wrong, the finger is pointed at us, yet we have nothing at all to do with it; not even the Commission has had anything to do with it. I am glad to say that the Commission is now on board and is helping to get this Bologna Process off the ground in the framework of our educational programmes with which you will be familiar. In short, the labour pains were difficult, and they are not yet over. It would have been wise to involve the parliaments.\nBy 2010 we want to create a European area of higher education. That goes without saying. Students must have a broad spectrum of choice, a wide range of high-quality courses. To this end, the Bologna Process envisages three priority areas for action: the introduction of the three-cycle system of bachelor's degrees, master's degrees and doctorates, quality assurance and recognition of qualifications and periods of ", "Community system against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Aubert, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing - C6-0454/2007 -.\nJoe Borg\nMember of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all allow me to thank the rapporteur for her work on this report. I am pleased to note the strong support of the Committee on Fisheries on this important proposal to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing.\nAs you know, IUU fishing constitutes a major threat to the sustainability of fish stocks and marine biodiversity, which undermines the very essence of the Common Fisheries Policy. I do not believe that it is necessary to expand any further on the disastrous global environmental and economic consequences of IUU fishing, as you are well aware of that. However, it is important to bear in mind that IUU fishing is a worldwide phenomenon, affecting in particular developing countries. This is why the proposal is a non-discriminatory instrument, applying to all Community trade of fishery products deriving from IUU fishing, in all waters, and to all Community nationals engaging in or supporting IUU fishing activities conducted under any flag.\nInternational cooperation is the key to the efficient elimination of IUU fishing. This is why the Commission has already commenced bilateral contacts with third countries. The Commission has also defined a working programme, in close cooperation with the Development DG and EuropeAid, to support developing countries, in order to assist them with a smooth and successful implementation of the regulation, in particular with regard to the catch certification scheme. This working programme includes seminars and workshops in a large number of third countries.\nThe Commission can agree with nearly all amendments proposed, which are eithe", "2. Uganda: the Bahati Bill and discrimination against the LGBT population\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Uganda: Bahati Bill and discrimination against lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgender people.\nV\u00e9ronique De Keyser\nMr President, Commissioner, exactly one year ago, we adopted a resolution in this House concerning gays and lesbians and the Bahati Bill in Uganda.\nWhy return, one year later, with an almost identical resolution?\nBecause the problem is far from solved. Firstly, the evangelist movement 'The Family', which was behind this Bahati Bill, has not given up, and we can still see this bill reappearing in Uganda.\nThe second reason is that, last October and November, Uganda's Rolling Stone newspaper carried out a name and shame campaign and published a list of Ugandan homosexuals, who were immediately tracked down and attacked and are still in hiding as outcasts today. The Ugandan Constitutional Court has stopped the publication of this newspaper but it is clear that the atmosphere has deteriorated. This is a manhunt.\nThirdly, only 13 African countries recognise homosexuals' rights. The remaining countries have very different laws, but some of them - Sudan, northern Nigeria, Mauritania - still punish homosexuals with death.\nYet, and I shall end with this, very recently, the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries made a statement - a somewhat one-sided one in my view - to the effect that they were aware that this issue regarding homosexuals bothered us slightly, but that these aspects were part of their culture. No, they are human rights, they are universal values, and we really do want these universal values to be strongly defended by the Commission and by the entire European Union.\nCharles Tannock\nauthor. - Mr President, societies in Africa are, in general, socially conservative. In many African countries, sadly, homosexuality is indeed outlawed. Many people in Africa feel threatened by efforts to promote h", "Research Fund for Coal and Steel (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Adam Gierek, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision on the multiannual technical guidelines for the research programme of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel - C6-0248/2007 -.\nJanez Poto\u010dnik\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, first and foremost, I wish to express my gratitude to the European Parliament, and particularly to the rapporteur, Mr Gierek, for the interest and support shown regarding the Research Fund for Coal and Steel.\nLet me also thank the chairwoman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Ms Niebler, and the shadow rapporteurs, Ms Laperrouze and Mr B\u0159ezina, for their constructive help. I understand that the request for a debate was made by a number of members of the ITRE Committee. I am therefore more than happy to summarise what is at stake.\nIn 2002, a protocol annexed to the Treaty of Nice created the Research Fund for Coal and Steel, a smart financial design using the interest accrued from the assets made available at the expiry of the European Coal and Steel Treaty. Activities under that Treaty were funded through a levy paid by the coal and steel industries, 27.2% and 72.8% of the budget being respectively allocated to coal and steel.\nThrough a bottom-up approach, this Research Fund is intended exclusively to fund research projects in the sectors related to the coal and steel industries, two major traditional sectors where research is still needed: firstly, to comply with current EU policies on environmental standards to combat global climate change and, secondly, to maintain energy security of supply by having a fuel mix that meets European demand.\nThe essential principles and proper decision-making procedures related to the management of this fund are defined in the multiannual technical guidelines for the research programme of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel. These technical gui", "1. MEDA and financial support to Palestine - evaluation, implementation and control (vote) \n- Report: Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou\n- Before the vote on paragraph 38\nPaulo Casaca\n(PT) Mr President, I should like to table an amendment that has been agreed with our rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou. This amendment is intended to replace the current Amendment 38 with the following text:\n'Welcomes the Council decision of 18 June asking the EU to resume normal relations with the Palestinian Authority immediately and to this end to develop the conditions for urgent, practical and financial assistance, including direct financial support to the new government, as well as to ensure the provision of emergency and humanitarian assistance to the population of Gaza;'\nRodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou \nrapporteur. - (EL) Mr President, I should like first of all to thank all my honourable friends from the various political groups who cooperated with me on this report, which is so important for our Euro-Mediterranean partnership and which also contains important and sensitive points which have to do with the funding of the Palestinian Authority.\nIn the amendment referred to by Mr Casaca which, as he knows, we made together, there is a parenthesis at the end '(via, especially, the TIM)', which is part of the oral amendment. I have no other amendments to table other than to mention that paragraph 38 referring to the Mecca agreement and to a national unity government is no longer topical and has been deleted and replaced by the paragraph which Mr Casaca has just read out, with the parenthesis '(via, especially, the TIM)' at the end. That is all, other than to thank you for your cooperation and support.\nPresident\nTo recap for everybody's benefit, Mr Casaca has tabled an oral amendment to paragraph 38, which in its original version and with the rapporteur's addition already has the words 'via, especially, the TIM' added at the end of the text that you will find attached to your voting list. Are there", "Welcome\nPresident\nI have been asked to welcome a visiting delegation in the gallery from the region of Piedmont. Normally, we only welcome delegations from nation States but, since we do wish to bolster the regions, I will make an exception and wish a warm welcome to the delegation from Piedmont.\n", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nDelcroix\nMadam President, I would just like to point out that my vote on the first amendment, which is No 26, in the Rothley recommendation, was not recorded. I intended to vote against the amendment.\n\nPresident\nVery well. It will be recorded, Mr Delcroix.\n(The Minutes were approved)\n\nFalconer\nMadam President, I rise on a point of order for a meeting, which will take place on 14, 15 and 16 May in my colleague, Mr Smith's constituency at Turnbury. It is by a group called the Bilderberg Group. This is a very strange group because it does not allow any press or interference with its meetings.\nMy point of order is on the central register of Members. Could I ask the Bureau to inform Members that, should they be participating in this group, then they should declare that under the 'Members' interests' . This will ensure that the same transparency and openness exist in this Parliament as in other parliaments, such as in Britain, where members of the Labour Party, i.e. Tony Blair, Giles Radice and Denis Healey, have all declared their interests in the operations of the Bilderberg Group. I trust that other Members of this House will take note and do likewise.\n\nPresident\nThank you, Mr Falconer. I have made a note of it.\n\nR\u00fcbig\nMadam President, I refer to Rule 127 in conjunction with Rules 95 et seq of the Rules of Procedure and welcome the Conference of Presidents' decision to include on today's agenda, in place of the Council and Commission statements on safety in cities, items on the dramatic events taking place in Kosovo and the nuclear tests in India. Nevertheless, like many of the other members of this House, it is my view that safety in the cities of Europe is also an important and urgent matter. Just this weekend a jeweller in Vienna was murdered by the Russian mafia. I therefore believe it is important that we debate the Commission's statement at the nex", "Approval of Minutes of previous sitting\nMonica Frassoni\n(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission triggered the radioactive risk alert system yesterday following an incident at Krsko in Slovenia, the details of which remain sketchy. The alert was made public via a procedure that has been described as unusual, but its causes and its consequences are still totally confused and unclear.\nWe therefore call on the Slovenian Presidency-in-Office and the Commission to maintain the level of transparency urged by the Commission, and to tell the European Parliament and the public what really happened and what is happening now, because a number of rumours are currently circulating which are neither clear nor wholly unambiguous. We therefore demand the necessary clarification from the European authorities.\nRoberto Musacchio\n(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like very briefly to endorse my colleague's request. We have here a very serious incident in a reactor which has already experienced problems in the past. Maximum transparency is required, not least because we know that shutting down a reactor and making it safe is no easy matter. As far as my country is concerned, we are just a few dozen kilometres away from Slovenia, which moreover currently holds the presidency.\nPresident\nWe have heard from two speakers on this item and I think that is sufficient.\nG\u00fcnter Verheugen\nVice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, on 1 June, on the basis of information received through the European Community Urgent Radiological Information Exchange (ECURIE) system and guided by the principle of precaution, the Commission released a public statement about the alert message from Slovenia at 17.38 local time. This concerned the loss of coolant that occurred in the primary cooling system of the Kr\u0161ko nuclear power plant in south-west Slovenia.\nAccording to the last information received from the Slovenian authorities, the reactor of the nuclear power plant of Kr\u0161ko ", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nCzes\u0142aw Adam Siekierski\n(PL) Mr President, there are a number of controversies surrounding the production and consumption of tobacco. We must be aware that the fact of tobacco growing in the EU really has no impact on the level of consumption of tobacco products by our citizens. Were we to restrict or cease tobacco production in Europe, this would not result in a fall in the number of cigarettes smoked. Imported tobacco would be used. I fully support the development of a public information programme to publicise the dangers of smoking, and this should be paid for by cigarette manufacturers and tobacco producers.\nZuzana Roithov\u00e1\n(CS) I support information campaigns on the harmful effects of tobacco and the European Parliament resolution on a long-term plan to finance these campaigns with EUR 80 million, deducted from the subsidies to European tobacco growers. This will mean that no burden will be placed on the EU budget. Although the level of raw tobacco production in Europe is marginal, barely 4% of world production, we are the world's leading importer of raw tobacco and for most of our requirements we rely on the supply from third countries where tobacco is produced locally under conditions that are less closely regulated than those applicable to European tobacco. However, I object to subsidising tobacco production in Europe, and not only as a matter of general principle: the public funds allocated for this area could be used elsewhere and in a better way.\nKaterina Batzeli\n(EL) Mr President, we, the PASOK Group in the European Parliament, have voted in favour of Mr Berlato's report. We believe the public should continue to be informed on matters relating to tobacco and tobacco products.\nThere should be a similar policy with self-financed funds to inform the public on health matters relating to other products such as meat and fats.\nFurthermore, in regions such as Greece, where tobacco production has been drastically red", "Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nStevenson\nMr President, I see in the Minutes that two Members spoke yesterday about delayed flights to Strasbourg on Monday. I would like to add that the flight from Amsterdam' s Schipol airport was also delayed and then cancelled. We were diverted to Basel-Mulhouse Airport. We were told that a bus would meet us there on arrival. In fact, it took 45 minutes after we arrived before the bus appeared at the airport. We finally got here, on Monday at 8.30 p.m., after some of us had spent more than 12 hours travelling.\nThis sort of service and difficulty in getting to Strasbourg on a Monday is quite hopeless. If the French Government insists that we continue to meet in Strasbourg, it could at least ensure, where flights are diverted to Basle, that buses arrive on time to meet the diverted passengers, otherwise it is quite pointless for us to try to arrive here on Monday and attend to any kind of business. I wonder if that could be added to the Minutes.\n\nPeijs\nMr President, I was booked on the same flight and I am rather embarrassed to admit that the airline was KLM, our national airline company. I hope that next time, also if any other airline company is involved, things will run more smoothly.\n(The Minutes were approved)\n\nSwoboda\nMr President, I would just like to draw your attention to something that concerns today' s agenda. We decided on Monday that the Council' s statement on the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Geneva Convention was to be postponed. I would just like to clarify that we will only be talking about the other items on this agenda today, and not about the Geneva Convention. This item has been postponed until the next part-session in March. It was erroneously included in today' s agenda.\n\nPresident\nMr Swoboda, I can confirm what you have just said and there is, in fact, a printing error. The document that has been distr", "Rare diseases (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Trakatellis, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a Council recommendation on a European action in the field of rare diseases - C6-0455/2008 -.\nAntonios Trakatellis\nrapporteur. - (EL) Mr President, this Council recommendation is very timely, because concerted action in the field of rare diseases is an absolute necessity, both at European Union level and at national level.\nAlthough the incidence for each rare disease is very low, millions of people are affected in the European Union because these diseases are measured in thousands. However, the proposal as received by Parliament was insufficient in its current state and it was not possible to produce a viable programme out of it. This is because it does not describe, at least in general terms, both the necessary funding by the European Union and the cofinancing by Member States or other organisations.\nThus it is not possible to promote certain essential aspects on rare diseases, namely the creation of networks of centres of expertise, cataloguing of diseases, collection of data, the special research required and so forth. The text asks for an implementation proposal from the Commission five years after the adoption, which is a long period during which nothing can be done in practice as there is no funding provided.\nTherefore, as rapporteur, I propose that the Commission be asked to provide the implementation proposal at the latest by the end of 2012, since by this date the required data from Member States on expert centres and expertise on rare diseases will be at hand.\nIn this implementation proposal, specific mention should be made for funding and cofinancing in the following areas:\nFirstly, the collection of epidemiological data and compiling a catalogue of rare diseases, as this is necessary in order to have a clear picture of the field of these diseases in the European Union.\nSecondly,", "Welcome\nPresident\nBefore moving on to deal with the order of business for today, I should like to welcome the delegation from the Duma and the Federal Council to the official gallery. In view of the significant role played by the Duma in recent developments in Russia, it is particularly appropriate that the European Union-Russia Joint Parliamentary Committee should be meeting here in Strasbourg today and tomorrow.\nI would urge members of that delegation to make every effort to ensure the success of the working session, which is particularly necessary in the light of the present situation.\n\nInternational financial crisis and political developments in Russia\nPresident\nThe next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the international financial crisis and political developments in Russia.\nI give the floor to Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, President-in-Office of the Council.\n\nFerrero-Waldner\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the present time we find ourselves confronted by global developments that pose a great economic and political challenge to the European Union as well as to the rest of the world. These developments demand exact analyses, direct crisis-management measures and political choices which will ensure long-term political and economic stability. The challenge confronts all players on the European political stage - national governments and parliaments, the European Parliament, the European Commission, the other European institutions and the Council.\nLet me emphasise the need to concert our efforts, for the political and financial dimensions of these challenges are such that we can only master them together. Europe has specific interests. These interests must be put on the table in our political dealings within the bilateral as well as the multilateral framework. In order to do that successfully, our interests must be clearly defined and broadly supported. That is why I consider today's discussion with the European Parliament to be especially im", "The ABB-ABM method as a management tool for allocating budgetary resources - Mid-term Review of the 2007-2013 Financial Framework (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following reports:\nby Mr Virrankoski, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the ABB-ABM method as a management tool for allocating budgetary resources; and\nby Mr B\u00f6ge, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the Mid-Term Review of the 2007-2013 Financial Framework.\nKy\u00f6sti Virrankoski\nrapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, before us is the report on Activity Based Budgeting and Management. I would like to thank the entire Committee on Budgets for its robust and consistent support, as well as the Committee Secretariat and all those who assisted me.\nActivity Based Budgeting (ABB) and Activity Based Management (ABM) were introduced during the Prodi Commission, spearheaded by Commissioner Kinnock. The stimulus for reform was provided by the report by an external group of experts that was commissioned to look into the crisis the previous Commission was going through. This report represents a sort of mid-stage review of what is referred to as the 'Kinnock reforms'.\nThe aim of ABB and ABM is to clarify administration by budgeting available resources and human resources according to policy area. Administration should be able to show the results achieved clearly in order to make their value compared to input clearly visible.\nThe main focus is results and not so much how they have been achieved. The approach reflects that used in business.\nThe system can also be expressed more simply. It is not enough that money is spent - or even 'blown' - legally or in accordance with the rules: the results determine the quality of administration, not good intentions.\nThe results also show how efficient management and administration are. Let us take the structural and cohesion policy as an example. If, two years and three months after the programming period starts, over three-quarters of the administrati", "Question Time (Council) \nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B7-0236/2009)\nThe following questions are addressed to the Council.\n\nSubject: Ethnic minorities in Serbia\nHow would the Council assess the situation of the ethnic minorities in Serbia, especially the Albanian community in the Pre\u0161evo Valley, where civilians have again come under attack?\nCecilia Malmstr\u00f6m\nThank you for your question, Mr Posselt. At the General Affairs Council meeting on 7-8 December this year, we adopted conclusions on enlargement and the stabilisation and association process. In these conclusions, the Council welcomed Serbia's commitment to EU integration and its work in implementing key reforms in line with European standards. The Council also stressed that the reform agenda must be continued.\nWe noted the Commission's communication of 14 October, which states that the general legal and institutional framework for respecting human rights is in place in Serbia and that progress has been made as regards improving compliance with international human rights legislation. The new Ministry of Human and Minority Rights in Serbia is playing an important part in this work. However, further efforts are needed to increase understanding of international standards. The Council also noted that Serbia has ratified all the major human rights instruments.\nWith regard to the specific situation in southern Serbia to which the honourable Member referred, some very violent incidents did indeed take place in July, including an attack on the gendarmerie based there. Several arrests were made, after which there were no more incidents. The atmosphere within the Coordination Body for Southern Serbia has since improved. It is fragile, but the main ethnic Albanian political parties from the region are involved in this work. There are also positive developments with regard to the sensitive issue of education. In this regard, I would particularly like to mention the opening of a university department in Medve\u0111a, ", "Social services of general interest (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Proinsias De Rossa, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the future of social services of general interest.\nProinsias De Rossa\nrapporteur. - Mr President, this report is about the future of universal social services and proposes pragmatic ideas for advancing the quality of those services, and decent working conditions for those who deliver them.\nIt is based on widespread consultation with civil society, with the social partners, and with local and regional authorities, and on detailed political compromises consolidating 285 amendments to the report. It is my objective to try to maintain the integrity of those compromises in the vote tomorrow.\nA high-level stakeholders' working group is proposed. For me this is the most important aspect of the report. We can differ here on matters of principle and on matters of law but the proposed working group provides us with an ongoing method to arrive at implementable solutions. I also propose a fourth Forum on Services of General Interest to monitor progress of the working group and other initiatives such as the European Voluntary Quality Framework.\nResearch consistently proves that social services, and public services more generally, are not only socially invaluable, but are also economically vital. Public services contribute 26% of our GDP and employ 64 million people, one third of whom are employed in the health and social services, while Eurofound research shows that public services are one of the most important ways of enhancing the citizens' quality of life, ensuring full inclusion in society and providing for social and territorial cohesion.\nThe report as it stands outlines reforms to address the problems and legal uncertainties that providers and users have identified as needing urgent solutions, such as the difficulties arising from current procurement and state aid rules. It also proposes an ac", "1. Iran\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Iran.\nRyszard Czarnecki  \nauthor. - (PL) Mr President, once again we are talking about Iran. I am the co-author of a resolution prepared by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group. The situation in Iran is a never-ending story of breaches of human rights. The European Parliament returns to this issue very regularly, giving the names of more victims and more examples of breaches of human rights. I have to say with some regret that some of the politicians in the European Union and some governments apply double standards, in that much more is said about human rights in the countries with which there is no trade, where one cannot do business. In the case of countries with which economic ties are maintained, even unofficially, without saying anything, but making money, people seem to speak about human rights more quietly, in a whisper. It is very good that the European Parliament is not whispering when it comes to Iran.\nIn the joint resolution that we are proposing, what I would like to emphasise over and above political divisions, is that we list new, specific and tragic facts that illustrate the drama that is taking place before our eyes in that country. The attention of the world's public opinion is focused on something else, on certain attempts to create a nuclear power in that country or on the clearly anti-Semitic statements of the President of Iran. Unfortunately we do not notice the breaches of human rights in that country, so it is good that the European Parliament is considering this issue today.\nMarios Matsakis  \nauthor. - Mr President, this is not the first time, and I fear that it will not be the last, that this House is called upon to deal with the situation in Iran. That country, which has all the natural resources for achieving an envious standard of living for its people, is unfortunately sinking deeper into the abyss of dark ages-like totalitarian governance, with the resu", "Possibility for Member States to restrict or prohibit the cultivation of GMOs in their territory (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item, which is of very great importance, is the report by Mrs Lepage, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2001/18/EC with regard to the possibility for the Member States to restrict or prohibit the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in their territory - C7-0178/2010 - 2010/208(COD)).\nCorinne Lepage\nMr President, you are correct, this is an important report because our fellow citizens attach a great deal of importance to this subject.\nFirst and foremost, I would like to give my very warm thanks to the shadow rapporteurs, who were enormously helpful to me in the drafting of this report.\nThe aim of the Commission's proposal is to permit Member States, if they wish to do so, to prohibit the cultivation of all or some genetically modified organisms (GMOs) within their territory. The initial proposal did not establish any kind of grounds on which that could be permitted, and this led to a number of criticisms from a legal point of view.\nIt has therefore been my objective to define common rules at European level which will enable us to supervise the opt-out process. Some subsidiarity is required, but we really must supervise the process in such a way as not to unravel the Community policies that we have had so much trouble introducing. However, this is also about responding to the wishes of the Member States, the various regions in Europe and the even larger number of citizens who do not want to allow the cultivation of GMOs to develop within their own territory.\nWe have therefore established three categories of grounds which could allow the cultivation of GMOs to be prohibited. The first grounds, on which all the groups are in agreement, are environmental grounds supplementing those that are e", "The work of the Plenary and initiative reports (amendment of the Rules of Procedure) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Corbett, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on amendment of Parliament's Rules of Procedure in light of the proposals by the Working Party on Parliamentary Reform concerning the work of the Plenary and initiative reports.\nRichard Corbett\nrapporteur. - Mr President, I hope colleagues will bear with me yet again taking the floor on a question of changes to the Rules of Procedure, which always seem to be on a Monday night.\nAs colleagues will be aware, Parliament has had a working group very ably chaired by our colleague Dagmar Roth-Behrendt which has been looking into improving the workings of our Parliament.\nWe have shifted from being a talking shop to a co-legislature. Whatever happens to the Lisbon Treaty, that change has already essentially taken place. It is therefore rational and logical that we should look at how we organise our work.\nOne major aspect of that is inevitably and rightly a shift away from own-initiative reports from committees, with no legislative impact, to focussing more on legislation.\nThat is the first and perhaps most important part of the package of proposals that I tabled before you today. The working group's proposals, of course, were wide-ranging: only a few of them require adjustment to our Rules, but this is one of them.\nThe idea here is that we should differentiate between the types and significance of own-initiative reports. Some, of course, will continue to merit full discussion and voting in plenary; but perhaps some really do not.\nWe should not turn this Chamber into a drafting committee that rewrites, paragraph by paragraph, a detailed own-initiative report on a specialist subject by a specialist committee.\nI would have liked to have gone further and ask: Why do such reports, that type of own-initiative report, not stand in their own right as a report of the committee?\nReports", "The Commission's annual strategic priorities (Budget 2008) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Ky\u00f6sti Virrankoski, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the Commission's annual policy strategy for the 2008 budget procedure, Section III - Commission.\nKy\u00f6sti Virrankoski \nrapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, firstly I wish to thank the German Presidency and in particular Dalia Grybauskaitfor their excellent levels of cooperation, as well as the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets and all the coordinators and shadow rapporteurs from the political groups.\nThe Commission communication on the annual policy strategy is the first step in drafting the new budget. Parliament's response will be its initial position.\nFirstly I want to speak about the communication's structure. The Commission employs its own system of classification to define policy areas: prosperity, solidarity, security, freedom and the strengthening of Europe's position in global policy. This division is difficult to follow because it does not correspond to the structure of the multiannual financial framework strategy any more than it does the budget. For the sake of transparency this classification should be reconsidered in the future.\nThe Commission presents a strategy which concerns, for example, climate change and action in the energy sector. The Lisbon Strategy is still important, as are the control of immigration and measures which make the Union a stronger global actor, but these are just some of Parliament's priorities. Parliament's main objectives also include the successful completion of approved programmes, less bureaucracy and better, more effective and appropriate administration. In connection with this year's budget it was agreed to review the deployment of staff. This screening operation is supposed to be completed this month. Parliament thinks it is very important.\nActivity-based budgeting and management is the key to better administration. It began to be developed after the res", "Parliament's priorities for the UN Human Rights Council (Geneva, 1-26 March 2010) (continuation of debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on Parliament's priorities for the UN Human Rights Council (Geneva, 1-26 March 2010).\nVittorio Prodi\n(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the 13th session of the UN Human Rights Council is an extremely important occasion.\nI would simply like to mention one or two cases that are not addressed very often. Specifically on the subject of prisons, but not those for terrorists, I would like to point out the truly inhumane conditions of the prisons in Rwanda and in Libya, where totally innocent people held in detention are sentenced to death.\nFurthermore, I would like to mention the issue of the Sahrawi people, which has remained unresolved for so long now, and I would also like to mention the rights of climate refugees who are driven from their countries by dramatic forms of climate change. These are all factors that must be taken into account, precisely because they are also the foundations of our society.\nAlexander Graf Lambsdorff\n(DE) Mr President, for its 60th birthday in 2005, the United Nations gave itself two new structures. The first was the Peacebuilding Commission and the second was the Human Rights Council. While the Peacebuilding Commission carries out its work fairly effectively and has largely met expectations, the same cannot be said, with the best will in the world, about the Human Rights Council. It has been said here - and expressed in the resolution - that a reform is sorely needed. The work of the Human Rights Council is too one-sided - my fellow Members have mentioned this - for example, Israel is discussed from a one-sided perspective. To be honest, I am not happy that the only major issue that the Presidency has highlighted here is the Goldstone report, which is certainly worth discussing, but it is not the main issue.\nIf Mr Howitt says that the election of Iran - if successf", "Voting time\nPresident\nThe next item is the vote.\n(For the results and other details on the vote: see Minutes)\n\nI have an announcement to make. Ms Eva Dudzinska is sitting to the right of me. She has spent almost 35 years in the European Parliament. For the last 10 years her activities have been closely linked to the plenary. She is now retiring. I would like to thank her and wish her all the best for the future.\n(Applause)\n", "EU funding in the area of decommissioning nuclear power plants in the new Member States (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Marinescu, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the efficiency and effectiveness of EU funding in the area of decommissioning nuclear power plants in the new Member States.\nMarian-Jean Marinescu\nMadam President, the accession treaties of the three Member States, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Lithuania, included the request to decommission a number of nuclear reactors which no longer met the safety conditions and could not be upgraded in a cost-effective manner. The aim of the financial assistance provided by the European Union was not to cover the entire decommissioning cost. The assistance was intended for measures in the areas of decommissioning, maintaining and monitoring reactors after shutdown, waste treatment, waste and spent fuel storage and decontamination, and dismantling work, as well as in the energy sector (for the replacement of the production capacity of the decommissioned units, improving energy supply security and energy efficiency, and other measures contributing to the necessary restructuring and upgrading of the energy infrastructure) and dealing with the social consequences (providing support for plant staff in maintaining a high level of safety after closure and retraining staff for new decommissioning tasks).\nDue to the fact that financial assistance was decided without any ceiling being specified, which even continued after decommissioning plans and strategies were drawn up, new, additional financial support could be provided. The European Union has provided significant sums of money in funding this activity, amounting to roughly EUR 2.8 billion between 1999 and now.\nThe report calls for the following aspects to be clarified in the future evaluations carried out by the European Commission and the Court of Auditors of the European Union: whether the funds allocated by the European Uni", "Formal sitting - Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew\nPresident\nYour Holiness, Patriarch Bartholomew, it is a great honour to welcome you to this formal sitting of the European Parliament during the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue 2008. The first guest to address the European Parliament as part of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue was the Grand Mufti of Damascus in January. He is from Syria and addressed us as a messenger of peaceful Islam.\nYour Holiness, you represent the Christian faith, and the Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks will address the European Parliament in Strasbourg in November as a representative of the Jewish faith.\nPeople from these three faiths - Christianity, Judaism and Islam - have lived side by side for centuries. Unfortunately, this coexistence has not always been peaceful. Even today, in the Middle East and elsewhere, there are areas marked by tensions between these communities.\nWe in the European Parliament support every effort to promote the peaceful coexistence of religions and cultures in the Middle East and elsewhere in the world. In the Middle East, there are also examples of religious tolerance and harmonious relations between people of different faiths. When I visited Syria a short time ago, I had the opportunity to meet the spiritual leaders of the various faith communities and they assured me that in their country, good relations exist, underpinning the dialogue between religions and cultures.\nThe European Union is a community based on values, and one of our most fundamental values is the dignity which is inherent in every individual. In this respect, religious freedom is central to human dignity, and goes far beyond the powers invoked by state authorities. The separation of church and state, which we esteem so highly, is a guarantee of the freedom of religious communities to manage their own internal affairs and external relations. These principles are reaffirmed in the Treaty of Lisbon, whose entry into force we are seekin", "Marketing of the meat of bovine animals aged 12 months or less (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Bernadette Bourzai, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the marketing of the meat of bovine animals aged twelve months or less C6-0330/2006.\nMariann Fischer Boel\nMr President, before going into the details of the report, I would like to thank the rapporteur Mrs Bourzai and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their very good work carried out on this fairly sensitive issue, namely the marketing of bovine meat at an age lower than 12 months.\nThe report is a response to the request made by the Council in the middle of 2004 towards a harmonisation of the definition of veal within the European Community. It follows a lengthy consultation process involving different stakeholders and Member State experts, during which the Commission has demonstrated its readiness to take into account, to the greatest extent possible, traditions and habits in different Member States. The Commission has also considered the main feature of the consumption and the production of veal within the European Union. It allows the main problems as regards the marketing of the meat of these young animals to be addressed, and I think it offers a balanced response to most of the concerns that have been raised.\nFor the first time, it is now possible to reach an agreement on this difficult issue. Many of the amendments that have been proposed or introduced aim to simplify the Commission proposal in order to try to cut red tape, to reduce the administrative burdens and the cost as much as possible, and in principle these amendments should not raise any problems. I am looking forward to listening to the discussion, and hopefully we can find a solution.\nBernadette Bourzai \nrapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted first of all to thank you all for your contributions, and a", "16. Strengthening of Eurojust and amendment of Decision 2002/187/JHA (\n- Before the vote on Amendment 19:\nEvelyne Gebhardt\n(DE) Mr President, as I indicated before the vote, there is an oral compromise amendment that I discussed with Mrs Weber and Mr Demetriou - a compromise between amendments 37 and 39. The compromise amendment would read as follows:\n'Other forms of offences where there are factual indications that a criminal organisation or serious crimes are involved.'\n(DE) That is how the compromise would be worded, and both amendments 37 and 19 would then be covered.\n(The oral amendment was accepted.)\n", "25. The Misleading Directory Companies report (\n\nChristopher Beazley\nMr President, while the Vice-President of the Commission is in her seat could I pass on a request to her in her position as Commissioner responsible for communication? A month ago Parliament's Baltic Europe Intergroup passed a resolution on the EU-Russia Summit, a matter of great importance to this House. We have not yet received an acknowledgement, never mind a reply. Could she perhaps raise this with colleagues in the Commission? It is a matter of great importance to this House.\nMargot Wallstr\u00f6m\nVice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, yes, of course I will follow up on that. I will make sure that you get a reply as soon as possible.\n", "5. Statute of the European Ombudsman (\nBefore the vote:\nAnneli J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki\nrapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, could you please propose to Parliament the following procedure, on which the coordinators on the Committee on Constitutional Affairs were unanimous at their meeting of 31 March.\nThe vote now to take place should only relate to a draft decision, with the vote on a motion for a resolution postponed until the Commission has delivered its opinion and the Council has given its approval. The President of Parliament should officially submit the text of the draft decision agreed by Parliament in the vote to the Commission and Council to examine, pursuant to Article 195 of the EC Treaty. Finally, he should request the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to make the necessary contact with the Council and the Commission and make a proposal to Parliament in good time on how to proceed in the matter.\n(Parliament approved the proposal on the voting procedure)\n", "Explanations of vote\nDuarte Freitas  \nin writing. - (PT) The harmonisation and reliability of data and information collected on marine activities is of critical importance for the fisheries sector and all efforts undertaken to improve their quality should be supported.\nGiven the sector's current needs and ecosystem concerns, the European Commission has proposed that Council Regulation (EC) No 1543/2000 be amended while the European Parliament assesses a proposal for a Council regulation on a new Community framework for the collection, management and use of data in the fisheries sector.\nIt is therefore necessary to amend the existing Council Regulation (EC) No 1543/2000 in order to prevent an overlap between the old and the new regulations.\nThe current Commission proposal makes these necessary and logical changes and was unanimously approved by the Committee on Fisheries. It also now merits my vote in favour in plenary.\nDavid Martin  \nin writing. - I voted for this report, which approves a Commission proposal amending (and preparing for the repeal of) Regulation 1543/2000 (a Community framework for the collection and management of the data needed to conduct the common fisheries policy). The Commission aims to bring in a new, more comprehensive data collection regulation in 2008; this amendment allows for a better transition by removing current requirements to submit six-year national programmes for the collection and management of data from 2007 to 2012. Instead, transitional programmes covering the years 2007 and 2008 are to be drawn up.\nGerard Batten, Godfrey Bloom, Derek Roland Clark, Roger Knapman, Michael Henry Nattrass  \nin writing. - UKIP wish to see the common agricultural policy abolished.

As such she oversaw the extraordinary transformation of her country from the low point of the immediate post-war period, through decolonisation and onto the vibrant and prosperous nation we know today, which plays such a constructive and leading role in our European Union.\nShe endeared herself to her people by her humility, her simplicity, her solidarity with the people \u2013 most particularly during the floods of 1953 \u2013 and her commitment to peace, cooperation and reconciliation.\nOur condolences go to Queen Beatrix, to the members of her family and to all the citizens of the Netherlands.\nI ask you now to observe a minute's silence.\n(1) \n\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013 I have been informed that Mr Christos Folias has been appointed Secretary of State in the Greek Government.\nI congratulate him on this appointment and note pursuant to Rule 8(4) of the Rules of Procedure the end of his term of office at the European Parliament with effect from 10 March 2004.\nBy letter of 24 March 2004 the Greek Minister of the Interior informed us that Ms Meropi Kaldi has been appointed a Member of the European Parliament to replace Mr Folias with effect from 24 March 2004. I welcome our new colleague and remind Members that, under Rule 7(5), until such time as a Member's credentials have been verified or a ruling has been given on any dispute, the Member shall take her seat in Parliament and on its bodies and shall enjoy all the rights attaching thereto.\nThe Latvian authorities have informed me that the term of offi", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nJanssen van Raay\nMr President, thank you for including my speech in the Minutes. It appears a little cryptic, because the reason why I actually spoke was that I was the rapporteur when the Secretary-General was given the possibility of using force if necessary, but the immediate reason was, of course, the fight that took place in the corridor. I do not wish to go into details, but the victim has now lodged a complaint, and I hope that you will treat it very seriously, leaving aside any amendment to the Rules of Procedure.\n\nPresident\nLet me first look at that section of the Minutes.\nWhat is the mistake?\n\nJanssen van Raay\nMr President, my brevity has made my speech appear rather cryptic, but the Minutes themselves are not incorrect. I have expressed my thanks, but I feel that some clarification is necessary, as I should be glad to explain to you later.\n\nMcMillan-Scott\nMr President, under item 5 of the Minutes yesterday - Membership of political groups - you announced that the Groupe Europe des Nations (Europe of Nations Group) had dissolved because it had not got enough nations .\nAs many colleagues know, Sir Jimmy Goldsmith has another party - the Referendum Party - and he will be fighting an election in the United Kingdom under his British citizenship.\nYou referred to Rule 29(2) but that Rule simply says that 'The minimum number of Members required to form a political group shall be 29 if they come from one Member State...' - if they come from! Mr President, could you confirm that means elected from, otherwise Mr Goldsmith could attempt to use his British citizenship and thereby establish another nation .\n(Applause)\nHaug\nMr President, in the item concerning the debate on energy efficiency and gas and electricity distribution, all the committees which delivered an opinion are referred to, with the exception of the Committee on Budgets. I also delivered ", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nFouque\nMr President, I would like the section of the Minutes concerning the vote on the calendar for part-sessions in 1997 to be corrected regarding my vote on Amendment No 27. I voted against, and so informed President H\u00e4nsch yesterday in writing.\nI voted against deleting the Strasbourg sittings for the week of 6 October, like all my fellow citizens and many others. An error in transmission ascribed the opposite vote to me. Since machines are said to be infallible and humans are said to make mistakes, the mistake would therefore be mine. I disclaim all responsibility for the mistake, but I should like to stress that I have no wish to stir up controversy about it in Parliament.\nThe vote, apart from this mistake, apart from this single vote, quite clearly proves that Strasbourg should remain the seat of Parliament and should retain its rights. Besides, it is only a point of law, as several of my French colleagues reminded us and demonstrated to us before the debate.\n\nPresident\nThank you, Mrs Fouque. I have noted that you intend to vote against Amendment No 27 to the calendar of Parliament's part-sessions for 1997. Your intention was duly recorded in the Minutes (Minutes of previous day's sitting). However, I have to say to you - as I shall probably have to do to other Members - that the outcome of the vote does not change given that Rule 123(5) states very clearly that 'the President shall decide whether the result announced is valid. His decision shall be final' .\n\nStriby\nMr President, the draft Minutes distributed to us cannot be approved as they stand because they contain an obvious contradiction as regards the roll-call vote on Amendment No 27 concerning the calendar of part-sessions for 1997.\nIt has rightly been pointed out that Mrs Fouque wished to vote against, but this is not taken into account in the result of the vote, which, may I remind you", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 13 December 1996.\nLadies and gentlemen, once again our Parliament is meeting to appoint officers for the next six-month legislative term. As the oldest Member, it is my duty to open this sitting and since I am easily the oldest Member of all, I would like, if you permit me, to make a very brief personal statement.\nI am the only person left in this House who was born before the first world war and can therefore remember this epoch-making event from my own experience. I am from an era that was shaped by the Vienna Congress at the end of the Napoleonic Wars. For it is to that Congress that we owe the long period of peace that gave rise to the astonishing economic upswing of that era, which had both its bright and its dark sides. I personally experienced three world wars, for after all what is called the cold war was nothing other than the third world war. And I witnessed two godforsaken and inhumane totalitarian dictatorships - under Stalin, who succeeded Lenin, and Hitler - their rise to power and their terrible demise. At that time I was fortunate enough to be able to work with important men who have done much for our continent. The first was the prophet of Europe, Richard von CoudenhoveKalergi, founder of the Pan-European Union, who warned us as even in 1922 that Europe would suffer severely if it did not unite in time. He and Aristide Briand and Gustav Stresemann only just missed achieving their aim. Had they succeeded, we would have been saved millions of deaths and endless human and material losses. I was also lucky enough to be involved in the efforts of statesmen such as Robert Schuman, Josef Bech, Konrad Adenauer, Charles de Gaulle and Franz Josef Strauss. Finally, I had the good fortune to conclude a long career by representing Bavaria in the European Parliament for 18 years. A wonderful time, in which I always had the feeling that our work is meaningful,", "Preparation of 2012 budget (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Balzani, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on general guidelines for the preparation of the 2012 budget [2011/2042 BUD].\nFrancesca Balzani\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, the document we are examining today is not merely a report on the priorities of the next European budget, but also and above all a strategic document looking at the new role that the European budget must play in the context of greater economic governance.\nThis is the first year of the European Semester, which has been designed precisely to establish the greatest possible coordination between the Union's budget and those of the Member States, the greatest possible synergy and the utmost complementarity. All of which essentially means one thing: convergence, and making the budgets of the Member States converge with the major goals of the European budget. Today, these objectives - these European objectives - can only be those laid down in the Europe 2020 Strategy: a grand, ambitious strategy with five highly important targets and seven big flagship initiatives. These are big, important goals, but they are also very specific.\nThe first target is extremely important and involves building a more fully, better employed Europe by making the right investments. We therefore have a huge priority for the 2012 budget: we must not waste time in executing the 2020 Strategy, beginning with the first of the targets, that of higher employment in Europe. Immediately setting out the dimension of the 2020 Strategy in our budget is therefore essential and a matter of urgency.\nTwo things are fundamental in order to achieve this: we must plan and we must look to the future. Planning means ruling out mathematical approaches to the budget, which are absolutely senseless. Mathematical, general and indiscriminate increases are of no use at all. Instead we must look at what exactly are the programmes and the actions that can contribute t", "10. Community statistics on public health and health and safety at work (vote) \n- Report: Scheele\nPresident\nIn view of the length of the forthcoming vote on the report by Peter Liese and the need to hold the formal sitting at 12 noon, I propose, ladies and gentlemen, that we bring forward the votes on the reports by Romana Jordan Cizelj, P\u00e1l Schmitt and Vittorio Prodi, and put Mr Liese's report to the vote after the formal sitting.\n(Parliament approved the proposal)\n", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nZuzana Roithov\u00e1\n- (CS) Mr President, I was delighted to support a report which will lead to administrative and legal simplification, which will increase consumer awareness about the quality and nutritional value of food both in Europe and in third countries, and which will also provide clarification to consumers about the use of safe production methods. I did not agree with the prioritisation of the olive oil or the olive sector and I trust that the Commission will also include the wine sector in the specific programmes in order to improve public awareness of the high quality wines produced in various regions of the European Union.\nMairead McGuinness\nMr President, I just wish to say that I supported this report. I was interested to hear during the debate that the Commission confirmed 70% cofinancing funding for the school fruit scheme, which will be hugely significant in the uptake of this scheme, and I clearly welcome it.\nMairead McGuinness\nMr President, thank you again for giving me the floor. I supported this report because it makes good sense that we should have a regulation that protects farmers' interests and the interests of those who produce their feed. I think what we now need is to communicate with the stakeholders what it means for them, as either feed operators or as users of animal feed, because it will not be enough that we have this regulation in place until there is good communication between all stakeholders.\nEwa Tomaszewska\n(PL) Mr President, I endorsed the report on the placing on the market and use of feed because it represents the interests of farmers and producers, as well as the health security of farm animals, and, by the same token, the health security of those who will later consume consumer the meat - people.\nClear definition of the ingredients of feedstuffs and the Community Register of Feed Additives will make it easier for farmers to make responsible decisions about the choice of the right ", "Population and housing censuses (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Juknevi\u010dien\u0117, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on population and housing censuses - C6-0078/2007 - .\nMeglena Kuneva\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, population and housing censuses are the central building block for all statistical reporting on the people that live in the European Union. In almost every policy area in which the EU is active, be it economic, social or environmental, high-quality population data are required to help formulate operational objectives and to evaluate progress. International, European and national institutions need census data to make valid comparisons between EU Member States.\nAccurate data on the population are required to comply with important legislation. Examples are the qualified majority voting within the Council, or the distribution of Structural Funds (on the basis of 'GDP per head' figures.)\nThe purpose of the present regulation is to provide a clear European framework to achieve comparability of the results of the censuses conducted in the EU Member States. It clarifies the responsibilities and roles of the statistical bodies on the national and the European levels and sets common requirements concerning the quality and transparency of results, methods and the technology used.\nThis will be a major step forward to the harmonisation of demographic and social statistics. Population censuses have a long tradition in the countries of today's European Union, in some countries reaching back over centuries. For the first time there will be a European legislative framework for the censuses. The word 'historic' might well be appropriate to describe this development. The regulation will also be an important milestone for international cooperation in the area of population and housing censuses in which the European Commission, via Eurostat,", "5. Financing of actions other than Official Development Assistance in countries falling under Regulation (EC) 1905/2006 (\n- Before the vote:\nThijs Berman\nrapporteur. - Madam President, I would like to refer this report back to committee under Rule 168(2). Both this democratically elected Parliament and the European Commission see the necessity to cover some modest forms of cooperation between the EU and developing countries, actions that are not strictly speaking poverty alleviation, such as exchange programmes between universities here and there.\nThe budget for development is not meant for this kind of cooperation, but some Members insist on using a legal base that would lead us to finance these actions with the development budget while that is precisely what we seek to avoid with this report.\nWe did not reach an agreement. If Amendment 1 is adopted, then this report would become incoherent and contrary to the interests of the world's poorest people. I consider, therefore, that we should refer this report back to the Committee on Development in order to agree on a legal base having the support of a clear majority of this House.\nMichael Gahler\n(DE) Madam President, there are indeed differences of interpretation. The legal interpretation by the Committee on Development is opposed to the interpretation by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and it is opposed to the legal interpretation by the legal services of our Parliament, to the case law of the European Court of Justice and to the view of the Council and the Commission, and therefore we, in the majority, insist on using the legal base as set out in this amendment.\nI ask therefore for the application for referral back to committee to be withdrawn. As regards the substance of the report there are no differences of opinion. We agree on the substance, it is only with regard to the legal interpretation that there are differences and a referral back to committee w", "Composition of Parliament\nPresident\nAs we know, Mr Stavros Lambrinidis has communicated to me his appointment as Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Greek Government with effect from 17 June 2011.\nParliament hereby takes note of this communication and, pursuant to Article 7(1) of the Act concerning the election of the Members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage, and Rule 4(1) and (4), establishes the vacant seat with effect from 17 June 2011.\nWe will continue with our work, wishing our former colleague very best wishes and good luck.\nThe competent Greek authorities have informed me of the election of Mr Dimitrios Droutsas to replace Mr Lambrinidis. Pursuant to Rule 4(1), Parliament takes note of this replacement with effect from 22 June 2011.\nI welcome this new Member...\n(Applause)\n... and point out that, pursuant to Rule 3(2), until such time as his credentials have been verified or a ruling has been given on any dispute, and provided that he has previously signed the declaration that he does not hold any office incompatible with that of Member of the European Parliament, Mr Dimitrios Droutsas shall take his seat in Parliament and on its bodies and shall enjoy all the rights attaching thereto.\nI am sure we wish good luck to our new colleague also.\n\nGerard Batten\nMadam President, on a point of order, I see over on the other side of the room that there are political posters displayed in the Chamber.\nI believe this to be against the rules. It does not bother me personally, but what I have asked for many times in this Chamber is that there is an even application of the rules to everybody.\nIf the ladies and gentlemen over there are to display their political posters, then I wish to have the right to permanently display my 'Vote UKIP' poster on my desk and for anybody else to display their posters.\nCan we have a ruling one way or the other please?\n(Applause)\nPresident\nThank you very much, Mr Batten, for drawing my attention to the posters. I would ask ", "9. Adaptation of the Rules of Procedure to the Treaty of Lisbon (\n- Before the vote:\nBruno Gollnisch\n(FR) Mr President, I see that unlike President Buzek, you do not suffer from poor lateral vision and you were able to see me.\nMr President, I have a very short point of order. Mr Martin's report is intended to sort out problems concerning adaptation to the Treaty of Lisbon, but among the different amendments that we are required to vote on, there is one that is not related in any way to the Treaty of Lisbon and, as I see it, goes against the general principles of Parliamentary procedure. It is the amendment that deprives non-attached Members of the power to appoint their own representatives.\nLadies and gentlemen, this is a very serious matter regardless of your political opinions. To hand responsibility over to the President of Parliament, however impartial he may be, for selecting a Member to represent the non-attached Members at the Conference of Presidents, based on goodness only knows what criteria, instead of to the non-attached Members themselves, I truly think goes against the general principles of law and against the case-law of the European Court of Justice.\nFor this reason, Mr President, I consider that this amendment should be withdrawn from the list of amendments we are voting on today.\nPresident\nThank you, Mr Gollnisch. You may recall that for several months I sat as a non-attached Member and, if I may say so, my political views are so divergent from yours that it merely proves the point that the non-attached section is not a group, and never can be.\n- At the end of the vote:\nDavid Martin\nrapporteur. - Mr President, I do not want to delay the House, but before we conclude this item, there are two technical points to be dealt with.\nAs you know, this process started last November. We need to add a new citation to link last November's vote with this vote, and I would ask the House to agree that we add the words 'having regard to its decision of 25 November ", "Women and business leadership (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on women and business leadership.\nRodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou\nrapporteur. - (EL) Mr President, my thanks to my fellow members and to the Commission for staying here so late this evening to debate an issue which is perhaps more in keeping with the lively activity and productivity of the day than the dead of night.\nFirst of all, my thanks to my fellow members, both present and absent, from all the political groups with which we cooperated, in order to highlight an issue which is important to society and to the economy and to focus on the strong message that we want to come out of the vote on this report, which is that women need to be promoted to firms' decision-making bodies.\nThe report has a dual objective: on the one hand, we want to highlight the weaknesses in society and the market and call for them to be corrected, for social justice and decency to apply, for there to be a balanced participation of both sexes where decisions and responsibility are taken. On the other hand, our objective is to stress that women are a valuable human resource, with knowledge, ambition and skills that are not exploited by companies, as this valuable human resource is under-represented on company boards.\nThe percentage of women on boards of directors is increasing by just one percentage point per annum. How many years will it take? How much energy will be wasted? How much talent will remain in the wings, bearing in mind that approximately 60% of graduates are women?\nResearch has clearly shown - I shall not bore you with numbers, there is a lot of interesting information in the report - that, when women are involved in companies' decision-making bodies, they turn in better results, perform better and are more efficient.\nIf our economy today is to achieve the faster growth that Europe needs and if our companies are t", "5. Equal treatment between men and women engaged in a self-employed capacity (\nAstrid Lulling\nMadam President, I agreed with Mr Cocilovo, who was the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, to insert the following clause into this important Article 6: 'If the legislation of a Member State does not stipulate obligatory affiliation to the social security system for the self-employed, affiliation is granted on request to the assisting spouse.'\nI shall explain what I mean by this. We insist that assisting spouses be compulsorily insured, as is the case for the self-employed. However, if, in a country, the self-employed are not compulsorily insured, we cannot require that this be the case for their spouses, as the latter cannot be affiliated to an insurance scheme that does not exist. That is why this additional paragraph has to be adopted. I am also acting on Mr Cocilovo's behalf in this matter.\n", "Community strategy on health and safety at work 2007-2012 (debate) \nPresident\n(EL) On the agenda for discussion, we have the report by Glenis Willmott, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, concerning the Community strategy for 2007-2012 on health and safety at work (2007/2146(\u0399\u039d\u0399)).\nGlenis Willmott\nrapporteur. - Madam President, health and safety at work encompasses a vast array of issues. At a simple level, it is about reducing accidents at work and work-related illness. For the individual, it is about his or her physical integrity, dignity and well-being. For businesses, it is about reducing the costs of absenteeism, sick pay and loss of productivity. For society as a whole, the costs of poor health and safety at work have been put at an astronomical 3.8% of gross national product.\nThe Charter of Fundamental Rights, signed last month in this very Chamber - despite the disgraceful outburst of certain UKIP and Conservative MEPs - provides in its Article 31 that everyone has the right to working conditions which respect his or her health, safety and dignity. It also provides that every worker has the right to limitation of maximum working hours.\nThe European Agency for Safety and Health at Work estimates that every year over 140 000 people in the EU die from occupational diseases and nearly 9 000 die from work-related accidents. These figures mean that every three and a half minutes somebody in the European Union dies from a work-related cause. That means that, in the short time I have been speaking already, it is possible that somebody has died and, by the time this debate is finished, it is probable that 20 people will have died.\nSome of our colleagues may contest the fundamental right to good health and safety at work, but I am sure none of them would question the right to life. A health and safety at work strategy for the EU should be strong on properly implementing and enforcing the existing regulatory framework. What we already have in p", "1. (\n- Before the vote on Amendment 29\nRichard Corbett\nrapporteur. - Mr President, I just wish to clarify that this amendment should be addressed, as on our voting list, to paragraph 2(c), which is where it actually fits in properly in the text, instead of paragraph 5(e).\n- After the vote on the motion for a resolution\n(Standing ovation)\n(Protests from the IND/DEM Group)\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, you have voted in favour of the Reform Treaty by an overwhelming majority. This is the expression of the free will of the people you represent. I congratulate you sincerely on this convincing result. The European Parliament represents the peoples of Europe. This Treaty gives the European Union more legal capacity to act and ensures more democracy.\n(Applause)\nWe defend Europe's common values and we will never permit those with the loudest voice to dominate the open discussion of reasons for and against. This is a free, democratic Europe. Many congratulations on this convincing result!\n(Applause)\n(Protests from the IND/DEM Group)\nThose who demanded these roll-call votes on amendments that contain nothing but questions ought to explain to their voters how much that cost. I tell you, as surely as you sit here now, what you did will harm your reputation. I think your parents would be ashamed to see you like this.\n(Applause)\n", "7. EU legislation aiming at the conservation of biodiversity (\nEsther de Lange\nrapporteur. - Mr President, I just want to ask you to take the final vote - the vote on the resolution as a whole - as a roll-call vote.\nPresident\nAre you making this request on behalf of a political group?\nEsther de Lange\nrapporteur. - Yes, Mr President, and it has been discussed with the shadow rapporteurs as well.\nPresident\nIt is a little late, but we can take a roll-call vote if nobody is against that. Is anybody against it? Mr Batten, are you against it?\nGerard Batten\nMr President, I do object, not because I object to it being a roll-call vote but because - as I have said in this Chamber many times before - we should have one set of rules that applies evenly to everybody. If one of us stood up and asked whether we could have a roll-call vote on something else, it would be denied. If we have rules, we must follow the rules.\nEsther de Lange\nrapporteur. - Mr President, with all due respect, we have had this procedure before. We can ask for a roll-call vote during the vote and if 40 Members oppose it, we will not take the roll-call vote, but until now, I have only seen one.\nPresident\nI would like to explain this without the need for excitement. The procedure you are talking about concerns oral amendments, because there is no deadline for the tabling of oral amendments. If you request a roll-call vote, another principle is involved - no one in the Chamber can oppose the request. In the case we have before us now, a deadline for tabling amendments had been set, and you did not make this request within the set time. These are the principles which are found in our Rules of Procedure. When a deadline for tabling amendments has been set, no one may oppose it. The resolution has been adopted. I would like to congratulate Mrs de Lange on her work on this resolution.\n", "Rapid Border Intervention Teams (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Deprez, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a mechanism for the creation of Rapid Border Intervention Teams and amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 as regards that mechanism - C6-0253/2006 -.\nJoe Borg\nMr President, the Commission strongly welcomes the excellent compromise reached by the European Parliament and the Council on the Rapid Border Intervention Teams Regulation.\nAs you know, over the last few years the European Union has experienced an increasing need for providing operational assistance to the Member States which, due to their geographical location and the complexity of their external borders, have to shoulder the heaviest burdens in terms of border control. In response, the European Union created the Frontex Agency in 2004 as a measure for channelling the solidarity between Member States and the Community in terms of operational cooperation. Moreover, a new External Borders Fund will be used from next year for ensuring financial solidarity, by boosting the capacity of all Member States to deal with the challenges posed by their different external borders.\nThe establishment of a mechanism for the creation and deployment of Rapid Border Intervention Teams is a further measure of solidarity. It is an important step forward in the cooperation between Member States and the Community, by controlling the external borders of the European Union and performing checks on people at these borders.\nThe Rapid Border Intervention Teams will become a highly trained and specialised reserve of border guards, which will be deployed at short notice, by the Frontex Agency, to a Member State in need of such assistance. As something new and ground-breaking in this regard, the rapid teams will be enabled to carry out all necessary functions related to the ch", "The review of the European Neighbourhood Policy Instrument (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Konrad Szyma\u0144ski, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the review of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument.\nKonrad Szyma\u0144ski\nMr President, I would very much like to address myself to a representative of the Council as well, but the Council did not decide to send anyone to this debate. I think that this is a pity, and that it is a bad habit. And I think that the President should react to this situation.\nReturning to the subject of neighbourhood, we must admit, we must be aware, that the countries which surround the European Union are changing very dynamically. Therefore, we need changes in neighbourhood policy. The Union for the Mediterranean is our answer to the needs of the south, and the Black Sea Synergy answers the challenge which intensified with the last enlargement of the European Union. The Eastern Partnership is a timely answer to the expectations of our European neighbours to the east.\nIn order to achieve the objectives which we have set in recent years for neighbourhood policy, citizens of neighbouring countries must feel a real political and economic rapprochement with the EU. This is why such importance is attached to establishing a deep free trade area and to rapid action to reduce visa fees, with the proposal of visa liberalisation for a significant part of these countries as the ultimate goal. Inclusion of energy in the most important objectives of neighbourhood policy should be our common goal, our mutual interest, and this includes engagement of our money in the modernisation of independent energy transfer networks, especially in the east and the south. Only in this way will we achieve political rapprochement with Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, Armenia and, ultimately, with Azerbaijan, and in the future - also maintaining appropriate balance - with the five republics of Central Asia.\nWhen we talk about the eastern a", "2. Venezuela, in particular the case of Maria Lourdes Afiuni\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on seven motions for resolutions on Venezuela, in particular the case of Maria Lourdes Afiuni.\nSantiago Fisas Ayxela\nauthor. - (ES) Madam President, Judge Afiuni granted parole to Eligio Cede\u00f1o, in accordance with Venezuelan law and in line with the opinion of the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detentions. This led to her incarceration in a maximum-security prison, in conditions that are putting her life in danger. President Ch\u00e1vez has publicly requested that the prosecutor seek the maximum penalty, and that the National Assembly pass a law to increase her sentence with retroactive effect.\nAmnesty International and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights have indicated their great concern.\nThis is not an isolated case, ladies and gentlemen. On the contrary, it demonstrates the autocratic and authoritarian drift of a regime that, alongside seemingly democratic elections, closes opposing media, orders confiscations and arrests political opponents, showing no respect for human rights and the rule of law.\nWe have therefore requested that Judge Afiuni be freed immediately.\nRenate Weber\nauthor. - Madam President, once again we are discussing in this Parliament the situation in Venezuela - not because we want to, but because we have to.\nThings have not improved since our last resolution; quite the opposite. The very idea of the rule of law is now disappearing under so much pressure put on judges and the judiciary, and this affects the exercise of a whole range of human rights, from freedom of speech - particularly media freedom - to private property.\nArticle 26 of the Venezuelan Constitution is very clear, stating that the judiciary is independent and the President is the guarantor of this independence. Nevertheless, more and more, President Hugo Chavez is simply dictating through public speeches to the prosecutors and the judges how to act and decide", "A catch documentation programme for bluefin tuna (thunnus thynnus) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Romeva i Rueda, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a catch documentation programme for bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) and amending Regulation (EC) No 1984/2003 (COM (2009)0406 - C7-0142/2009 -.\nRa\u00fcl Romeva i Rueda\nMr President, at this stage I do not think that anyone is unaware - it is no longer a secret - that the value of this animal is extremely high, particularly in some markets such as the Asian ones. In fact it is so highly prized that some operators have been cheating and continue to do so.\nEach year the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) adopts ever more complex and restrictive management measures: recovery plans, documentation schemes and vessel capacity restrictions, and every year the European Commission claims success at ICCAT, that finally the organisation has taken the necessary steps to reduce illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing of bluefin tuna, and that the situation is under control.\nTime goes by, however, and the measures that are supposedly meant to ensure the conservation or at least the recovery of bluefin tuna either do not come, or come too late and are insufficient.\nThe premature closure of the purse seine season only a few days ago due to the fact that the EU quota had been almost exhausted demonstrates that there is still a problem of excess capacity in Europe, which is a huge threat to the survival of the species.\nThe stocks are not showing the necessary signs of medium-term recovery, in fact the signs are quite the opposite. The depleted status of both stocks of bluefin is well known. The spawning biomass of both stocks has been reduced to less than 15% of the unfished biomass. The combination of this with the very high prices paid for the fish, whether it is caught legally or n", "Welcome\nPresident\nI am delighted to inform you that there is an official delegation in the Chamber made up of religious leaders, in particular, from the Christian world in the Middle East, from Iraq and Lebanon.\n(Applause)\nWe are aware of the difficult situation in the region for many Christian communities, and consequently we are delighted to express our support. You are therefore very welcome to the European Parliament.\n", "3. Common rules for access to the international road haulage market (recast) (\nMichael Gahler\n(DE) Mr President, given the hundreds of votes that we now have, perhaps you could just announce 'adopted' or 'rejected' rather than reading out the individual figures.\nPresident\nYes, Mr Gahler, I would like very much to do as you wish, and I have in fact done that in the past. I am not doing it today because the Association of European Journalists has asked that we detail the votes. If we do not, the result cannot be duly recorded, and they rightly state that if they do not know the result of the vote, they cannot make a political assessment as to the position of the House.\n", "Securities to be offered to the public and harmonisation of transparency requirements (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Wolf Klinz, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directives 2003/71/EC on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading and 2004/109/EC on the harmonisation of transparency requirements in relation to information about issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market - C7-0170/2009 -.\nWolf Klinz\nMr President, Commissioner, if I take a little more than four minutes, I will make my concluding remarks shorter so that I do not overrun my six minutes.\nThe Prospectus Directive was originally put together in 2003 with the condition that it be reviewed in September 2009. That has been the case. The Prospectus Directive concerns the completion, approval and publication of prospectuses as a prerequisite for the public offering of securities or their emission into a regulated market within the European Union. In general, the current review concerns technical aspects and is intended to eliminate legal uncertainties and unjustifiably onerous requirements.\nFirst of all, I would very much like to thank all the Members who have worked together with us on this, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs. We have had very good cooperation, and that includes with the Commission. Without such good cooperation, we would not actually have been able to see this package through to a successful conclusion at first reading in less than ten months. I would now like to present briefly the agreement we have forged - and this includes the tripartite talks - in the form of eight principal points on which we were able to reach agreement.\nFirstly, one of our objectives was to facilitate access to capital in the market for small and medium-sized enterprises. You know that in the US, there i", "Action programme in the field of lifelong learning (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the Council common position (06237/3/2006 C6-0274/2006 establishing an action programme in the field of lifelong learning. (Rapporteur: Mrs Pack).\nDoris Pack \nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, the new 'lifelong learning' programme was intended to be a sufficient response, within the framework of the Lisbon process, to the challenges of the present day, for education - as we all, together with everyone else, constantly affirm - is the be-all and end-all of our countries' joint efforts at coming out top in globalised competition.\nThe Council's cuts in the general budget have also had the unfortunate effect of cutting this multi-annual programme back. The Commissioner has had no hand in these cutbacks. He was on our side, fighting for more. It is regrettable that the Member States did not want that. The final figure we arrived at was EUR 14.37 billion over seven years, but, following negotiations, we have been left with no more and no less than EUR 6.97 billion in the Financial Perspective. Even so, I want to thank all those Members who fought successfully and made it possible for us, together, to achieve a EUR 800 million increase in the funds originally allocated to this programme in the Financial Perspective.\nSo much for the lofty goals and the bumpy return to earth.\nThe 'lifelong learning' programme is founded on the two programmes 'Socrates' and 'Leonardo', develops them further and enables working in synergy. We have learned from the latest programmes; our countries' various national agencies have acquainted us with the problems that they had with the programmes, and their views have all, in fact, been taken into account. The 'lifelong learning' programme includes the 'Comenius' programme for schools, its university counterpart 'Erasmus', the 'Leonardo' programme for voc", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of the last sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nTitley\nMr President, I refer to page 11, item 7 of the Minutes - the debate on my report. I wish to make a personal statement following the speech by Ms McKenna, in which she said: ' I know that Mr Titley is a lobbyist for what I would call the merchants of death.' As a dramatic statement, that is in line with the best editions of Irish literature; as a statement of fact, it is entirely untrue. It is not in the best interests of the House, particularly when debating the Ford report on lobbyists, for accusations of this nature to be made by a Member of this House.\nI can assure this House I am not a lobbyist for anybody, and, as to merchants of death, we do not meet many of them in Bolton market, so I am not sure what she means. She also said that I advocate in my report that the European taxpayer should contribute to the arms industry. There is no such claim whatsoever in my report. This only propagates a Green newsletter which is widely distributed, and which, if it were in the United Kingdom, would be libellous. Therefore, I would like to make it clear that these statements are entirely untrue.\n\nColino Salamanca\nMr President, I wish to make a statement because yesterday in southern France a certain number of goods, mostly Spanish ones, mostly fruit and vegetables, attacked and destroyed. I wish to condemn this act of aggression and call on the Community authorities to remind the French authorities of the need to ensure the free transit and free circulation of goods.\n\nPresident\nUnfortunately, we witness similar attacks from time to time in various Community countries in recent years, and I think we all ought to echo your protest and condemn these attacks each time, because the national authorities should indeed protect the free movement of workers from other European countries who come into the European Union.\n(Parliament approved the Minutes)\n\nNuclear i", "Road infrastructure safety (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Helmuth Markov, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on road infrastructure safety management - C6-0331/2006 -.\nAntonio Tajani\nMember of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing another topic related to the safety of our citizens on Europe's roads.\nI believe that we must emphasise this issue. This afternoon I had a meeting with the officials in my Directorate-General with a view to enhancing and redoubling the Commission's efforts in the field of road safety.\nThe figures for the past few months are not reassuring, unfortunately, and could jeopardise the aim we have set ourselves of halving the number of victims on the roads. That is why we must press on with our work. I am delighted today that we are able to conclude another directive relating to road safety and hence the safety of all of Europe's citizens.\nIn the 2001 White Paper on European transport policy, spearheaded by Mrs Loyola de Palacio, the Commission put forward the ambitious goal of halving the number of lives on the roads by 2010. Parliament welcomed this initiative and has always supported it.\nAs I was saying, after a series of extremely positive figures in recent years, the past year's results have unfortunately not been as positive as we would have liked. Moreover, we all realise of course that the overwhelming majority of accidents are primarily caused by human error or carelessness.\nNevertheless, the state of the road network, combined with growing volumes of traffic, is often a key factor in causing accidents. The state of the road infrastructure has in fact been shown to play a determining role in one in every three accidents. For this reason, over and above initiatives geared to improving the conduct of road users and the level of vehicle safety, infrastructure ought to be the third pillar ", "Coordination of certain of the Member States' provisions on television broadcasting (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Hieronymi on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education on the coordination of certain provisions laid down in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities\n- C6-0443/2005 -.\nViviane Reding\nMadam President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I would thank all those in this House who have worked on the proposal for a directive on the various audiovisual media services. I should like, in particular, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Hieronymi, as well as the co-rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs who have put a lot of time and energy into drawing up Parliament's opinion.\nTheir efforts have been rewarded, as a number of the amendments that we are examining today improve the Commission's initial proposal, presented on 13 December 2005. I also wish to emphasise the excellent cooperation between Parliament, my services and the Council, whose Finnish Presidency has done a first-class job.\nThe proposal for a directive on audiovisual media, which updates the TV Without Frontiers Directive, will be seen as one of the important pieces of legislation adopted in the course of this Parliamentary term. It responds to two requirements: firstly, it enables us to adapt our audiovisual enterprises to the considerable technological and commercial developments that have taken place; and, secondly, it demonstrates the political will that exists to ensure the continuation of the values essential to our communal life and to the forming of public opinion.\nOn the one hand, the technical and commercial aspects have to be taken into consideration. There are the new means of watching television, such as Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) and video on demand (VOD), the shift to digital technologies offering many more services and the arrival of new players in the market, including telecommunications companies, I", "Commission Question Time\nPresident\nThe next item is Question Time (B6-0012/2007).\nThe following questions are addressed to the Commission.\nFirst part\nSubject: Road transport and emissions\nGiven that road transport is responsible for 25% of EU emissions of CO2 and aeroplanes for 3% of EU emissions of CO2, what level of research has the EU Commission undertaken concerning the annual emissions of road transport (cars, buses, trains etc) and their effect on the environment, taking into account that great political and media emphasis has focused on the emissions emitted by planes?\nStavros Dimas\n\u039cember of the Commission. (EL) Madam President, I am delighted to have an opportunity to reply to this very important question.\nThe question by the honourable Member is whether the Commission has a full picture of emissions of greenhouse gases from road transport and what measures it proposes to reduce the effect on the environment of these emissions. The Commission services, in cooperation with the European Environmental Bureau, records and monitors annual emissions from all domestic means of transport in the European Union.\nI shall comment first on emissions of carbon dioxide, to which the honourable Member's question refers. In 2003, emissions of carbon dioxide from the transport sector in the European Union of the 25 totalled 951 million tonnes, accounting for approximately 21% of all emissions of greenhouse gases in the European Union. Road transport generated emissions of 892 million tonnes of carbon dioxide; in other words, road transport accounts for the biggest share of emissions of greenhouse gases within the European Union. From these statistics, which refer to all forms of transport within the European Union, we need to distinguish international aviation. Aviation can be divided into domestic flights and international flights. As far as international flights are concerned, the production of carbon dioxide is 112 million tonnes more than the amounts I referred to earlie", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 17 November 2000.\n\nStatement by the President\nPresident\nMany Members of the House wanted us to commemorate the hundredth anniversary of Mr Gaetano Martino' s birth.\nIt is my great honour today to pay tribute to the memory of this great European, whose name is inextricably linked to the Messina Conference which, in 1955, paved the way for the European Community.\nMr Gaetano Martino was an illustrious doctor and politician. He was a credit to the European Parliament as a Member for ten years, and was twice elected President of Parliament in the 1960s.\nHis presidency of Parliament crowned a long political career which led him to hold high office firstly in the Italian National Parliament and then within the Italian Government, where he was, in turn, Minister for National Education and Minister for Foreign Affairs.\nAs a Minister and as a Member of the European Parliament, he fought a particularly bold campaign in favour of the European University Institute in Florence.\nIndeed, he considered Europe' s shared foundations to be both cultural and spiritual.\nFrom the very outset, the construction of Europe proved to be a difficult road, strewn with obstacles, which Mr Gaetano Martino, however, with the support of his deep-seated humanist culture and his unwavering faith in Europe, successfully negotiated. This is illustrated by the fact that, on 1 June 1955, i.e. less than a year after the failure of the ambitious plan for a European Defence Community, he started to weave the fabric of unification anew by proposing the Messina Conference which became, as we all know, the wellspring for the 1957 Treaties of Rome. So the European engine, which had just about stalled, suddenly came to life and the common market became a reality.\nWe have decided to publish Gaetano Martino' s collected speeches in a single volume. They are truly edifying for young people who did not li", "5. EU action on oil exploration and extraction in Europe (vote) \nCorien Wortmann-Kool\nMr President, paragraph 7 calls for a review of the EU's capacity for immediate response to accidents and for a European action plan. In the second part of that paragraph, there is a specific reference to the Arctic zone. The oral amendment is in addition to that second part and reads, 'moreover notes that the Mediterranean, Baltic and North Sea area has to be taken into consideration'.\nVytautas Landsbergis\nMr President, I propose inserting a little qualification about drilling operations in order to avoid any misinterpretations in cases where third countries are also involved. Concerning drilling operations, I would like to insert 'by EU and third countries'. Please support this.\nBogus\u0142aw Sonik\n(PL) In my capacity as rapporteur, I would like to thank you for voting. The aim was, in cooperation with the European Commission, to define the highest standards possible for oil drilling operations in European waters.\nAt the same time, I would like to express sympathy and solidarity with my Hungarian fellow Members and what they are currently experiencing with the toxic spillage. We should also create the highest standards possible for dangerous waste in Europe.\n", "8. Equality between women and men - 2008 (\nBefore the vote on Amendment 5:\nIratxe Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez\nMr President, on the voting list of my group, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, we proposed to vote in favour of Amendment 5 if the authors of the amendment accepted that it was an addition. In the conversations we have had with them they have not taken on this proposal; we therefore wanted the paragraph to remain as it originally appeared in the report and will vote against Amendment 5 if it is not agreed that it is an addition.\n(The GUE/NGL Group, author of the amendment, agreed)\n", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nJaros\u0142aw Kalinowski\n(PL) Mr President, to protect public health effectively, it is essential to ensure patients have extensive access to high quality information about medicines. Harmonisation of the law in this field will allow us to ensure a high level of awareness among European patients and will help to even out differences in the health situation in all Member States. In addition, making legislation more detailed, and in particular the obligation to ensure that patients have access to information, will allow us to prevent pharmaceutical companies from unfairly promoting their own products. Currently, this procedure is not adequately supervised. It is also necessary to introduce particular legislation concerning pharmaceutical agents and to enforce its implementation effectively in all Member States. I endorsed the report.\nJens Rohde\n(DA) Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Fjellner on a splendid result. The Danish Liberals have chosen to vote in favour of the directive concerning information on medicinal products subject to medical prescription. It is important for the EU's citizens to have access to sound information on these medicinal products, and we therefore think that this is a good report that puts the patient first.\nThat being said, we felt obliged not to vote on the regulation itself. That is not because we are not in favour of EU citizens having access to sound information on these medicinal products subject to medical prescription, but because parts of the proposal contravene a number of national constitutions. Even before the medicinal products package was presented, several countries had already made the Commission aware of the fact that there is a legal problem in relation to their national constitutions. Prior checking by the authorities of information that is disseminated to the general public contravenes the definition of freedom of expression in several countries. Therefore", "1. Border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on seven motions for a resolution on border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia\nBarbara Lochbihler\nMr President, the border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia at the beginning of this month placed the decades-long conflict over access to the temple of Preah Vihear back in the consciousness of the international public. Although the armed clashes have abated somewhat at present, we must push for a political solution to be found to this conflict. ASEAN, the United Nations and the EU have a duty to work more intensively on this now, and not to wait until the situation escalates again before reacting.\nIn the most recent clashes civilians and soldiers on both sides were injured and killed. The use of cluster bombs was particularly perfidious. These cluster munitions wreak havoc on civilians that continues long after their launch. Up to 30% of cluster munitions fail to explode and remain on the ground as unexploded bombs, where they later explode when disturbed perhaps by playing children. We call on Thailand and Cambodia to stop using these terrible weapons immediately. We also call on both governments to sign up to the international convention banning cluster munitions.\nFinally, I would urgently appeal to the governments of Thailand and Cambodia to make every effort to resolve this conflict without resorting to arms. The civilian population on both sides will only suffer further; suffer for something to which politicians can find a negotiated solution if they only have the political will to do so, rather than attempting to pander to cheap nationalism on both sides of the border.\nMarietje Schaake\nauthor. - Mr President, since the beginning of this month there have been fights between the armed forces along the Thai-Cambodian border, near the temple of Preah Vihear, which is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage site. We have a responsibility to protect the lives of people first and f", "Palestinian prisoners in Israel (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on:\nthe oral question to the Council on Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails - B6-0166/2008);\nthe oral question to the Commission on Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails - B6-0167/2008);\nLuisa Morgantini\nauthor. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we put a simple question to 47 Members from different political groups: what are the Council and the Commission intending to do about the violations of international conventions by the Israeli authorities as regards Palestinian prisoners? The vast majority of prisoners are detained in Israeli territory, violating Article 76 of the Geneva Convention: arbitrary arrests, house-to-house searches, administrative detention, torture and abuse during interrogations in detention centres. Men, women, teenagers, students, MPs and mayors, some 10 000 people imprisoned out of a population of three and a half million; there is a ban on visits for those aged between 16 and 35, with the result that prisoners have not been able to see brothers, sisters, mothers and fathers for years.\nAll this has been documented by international organisations including Amnesty International, the United Nations and admirable Israeli organisations such as B'Tselem and Hamoked, and by Palestinian organisations such as Addameer and Defence for Children International. However, no pressure is being exerted on the Israeli authorities to respect the conventions and the rules that they are themselves ratifying and that we are also ratifying.\nI should like to read an account, an appeal from a mother: 'I am the mother of the prisoner Said Al Atabeh, of Nablus. My son has been in jail since 1977, and I am 78 and suffer from high blood pressure and diabetes; I am losing my sight and cannot really get around my own home any more.

Energy performance of buildings (\n- Before the vote:\nSilvia-Adriana \u0162ic\u0103u\nrapporteur. - Mr President, I would just like to say that, on the voting list for Article 7, Amendment 57, only if the first part is adopted will Amendments 106 and 117 fall.\nConcerning Article 9, Amendment 102, if all of them are adopted, Amendment 60 will fall. Otherwise we have to vote on the corresponding part of Amendment 60.\nPresident\nThank you Mrs \u0162ic\u0103u, we take due note of your observation.\n- Before the vote on Amendments 109 and 124:\nSilvia-Adriana \u0162ic\u0103u\nrapporteur. - Mr President, we have to vote on Amendments 109 and 124 too - the corresponding part.\n", "Second 'Marco Polo' programme (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Ulrich Stockmann, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1692/2006 establishing the second 'Marco Polo' programme for the granting of Community financial assistance to improve the environmental performance of the freight transport system ('Marco Polo II') - C6-0482/2008 -.\nUlrich Stockmann\nrapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, the displacement of freight from road to rail and internal waterways or short sea shipping is a slow burner in our transport debates and has been for decades. Now, in the context of the climate debate, this debate has naturally taken on new importance.\nIn the meantime, we have arrived at this shift via various political approaches and instruments. However, if we look at it carefully, traffic is very difficult to shift in practice and this is only achieved in very rare cases.\nFirstly, because connections between the modes of transport are still not sufficiently harmonised; secondly, because rail and inland waterways are still not sufficiently established as European service providers, and thirdly, because the environmentally-friendly forms of transport obviously cannot essentially provide a door-to-door service.\nAll these difficulties are being further exacerbated in the present recession by plummeting prices in road freight transport. Marco Polo II has also felt the impact of all these problems. That is why we transport politicians are urgently interested in a solution, because our stated target, namely that Marco Polo should help to displace 60% of the increase in road freight traffic, is now a long way away. We therefore need to switch direction before the end of this parliamentary term and we have therefore found a most reasonable compromise.\nWhat is to happen? Firstly, the Commission instructed an agency to take over the administ", "Rule of law in Russia (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the rule of law in Russia.\nI would like to ask Mrs Gy\u0151ri to take the floor on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative.\nEnik\u0151 Gy\u0151ri\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, at the request of Baroness Ashton, the Hungarian Presidency of the Council is representing the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission during this debate. Baroness Ashton, as you may know, is travelling in northern Africa and in the Middle East this week.\nI wish to thank you for raising the issue of the situation of human rights and the rule of law in Russia. Despite some very positive signals from President Medvedev last year, the actual human rights situation in Russia and, in particular, in the Northern Caucasus region, remains deeply preoccupying. Violence, harassment and intimidation against activists, lawyers and independent journalists are of great concern to us.\nThe number of cases to support this statement is unacceptably high. The brutal attacks on Russian journalists, Oleg Kashin and Anatoly Adamchuk, and environmental activist, Konstantin Fetisov, are among the latest reminders of the climate of insecurity and intimidation that journalists, activists and human rights defenders in Russia face in their day-to-day work.\nDespite assurances at the highest levels, the perpetrators are rarely brought to justice and sentenced. Accountability for violence and intimidation against human rights defenders - let me mention the cases of Mrs Estemirova, Mrs Politkovskaya, Mrs Barburova and Mr Markelov among a great number of others - remains an important test for the independence and efficiency of Russia's judiciary. As long as the crimes remain unsolved, a climate of impunity will continue to prevail.\nThere are, however, also positive developm", "1. Guatemala\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Guatemala.\nJ\u00f3zef Pinior\nauthor. - (PL) Mr President, in recent months in Guatemala there have been a number of unexplained murders, unexplained threats, cases of intimidation of trade union activists, politicians, and of society as a whole. Human Rights Watch published its recent report on human rights in January 2007. This report states that during the 36-month dirty war in Guatemala, which ended in 1996, some 200 000 people were killed. I repeat, 200 000 people were killed during the 36-month dirty war in Guatemala.\nOver the last 20 years we have witnessed the process of democratisation in Guatemala, including many achievements concerning the rule of law, and the development of democratic institutions. However, Guatemala still remains a country where the rule of law is compromised, and where democracy has not yet taken root. We are faced with a whole series of unexplained murders and disappearances in the past, together with current incidents involving powerful gangs, and international crime.\nLet me remind the House that in 2005 between 70 and 80 million documents linked to the dissolved national police were found. These documents contain information regarding the so-called 'disappeared' during the dirty war. An appropriate storage place for these documents has so far not been found. It is high time for Guatemala to resolve these issues in a democratic manner.\nMr President, today in this House we have voted through recommendations for the Commission regarding the Association Agreement with Central American countries. My political group has stressed that we believe trade liberalisation should be seen in a political perspective. Trade liberalisation in Latin America cannot be separated from democratisation. The European Union must make every effort to help the people of Guatemala to reinforce democracy, investigate all murders that happened during the dirty war, and strengthen the p", "Common principles on flexicurity (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Christensen, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on common principles of flexicurity.\nManuel Lobo Antunes\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, I thought you were asking me to make a final speech on the Charter debate, a speech which I do not have prepared, hence the reason for my confusion.\nMr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of flexicurity is now a key item on the European agenda and is essential for the future of Europe's economic and social models. It is a complex issue involving the capacity to manage change and promote employment and social security reform in a rapidly changing global context which requires responses to the challenges of global competition, technological innovation and population ageing. We need more flexible markets, but this also means that we must ensure better conditions, better instruments and more security for our citizens so that they can handle this change positively. That is the challenge facing us.\nFor our part, the Portuguese Presidency has tried to contribute actively to the search for integrated and balanced solutions in this area. Following the Commission communication presented in June, we were responsible for conducting a process aimed at carrying out the European Council mandate and achieving consensus on the common principles of flexicurity. The Commission communication naturally formed an excellent starting point for this work as it helped us to develop the concept and increase discussion of the solutions that could serve as a common platform for the various lines which each Member State will have to follow.\nBearing in mind that the starting points and situations are different, the solutions will also have to differ. In order to create the conditions for progress in this area, we developed various initiatives with the main actors at European level, including a Conference o", "6. Upcoming EU-US summit and Transatlantic Economic Council (\nElmar Brok\n(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, several groups are of the opinion that we should say something about coordinating currency policy measures, following the decision made by the US Federal Reserve concerning the USD 600 billion. We simply want to add:\nCalls on the United States, in implementing its domestic monetary policies, not to exacerbate the problem of the global balance of exchange rates.\n(DE) I believe that this would be a reasonable addition, because it will definitely play a role at the summit.\nElmar Brok\n(DE) Mr President, in addition to what I have just said, I would like to ask for currency policy to be included in the recitals. I believe that this is a sentence which could gain broad agreement here:\nWhereas coordinated monetary policies should take a higher priority in the transatlantic partnership.\n", "Milk quotas (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the oral question to the Commission on milk quotas by Duarte Freitas, Carmen Fraga Est\u00e9vez, Salvador Garriga Polledo, Esther Herranz Garc\u00eda, Elisabeth Jeggle, Albert Jan Maat, Mairead McGuinness, Francisco Jos\u00e9 Mill\u00e1n Mon, James Nicholson, Neil Parish and Daniel Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group - B6-0444/2006).\nDuarte Freitas\nauthor. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to thank the political group and the other groups for the interest that they have shown in this subject and that made it possible for this oral question to be put quickly onto the agenda. This level of interest is indicative of the importance and sensitivity of the issue of milk quotas.\nCommissioner, you suggested at the informal Council meeting that the system of milk quotas appears increasingly outdated and that it should be questioned and examined in such a way that farmers can plan their lives over the long term. On 3 October, at the last meeting of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Rasmussen, representing the Commission, confirmed that we would see changes following the CAP 2008-2009 health check, most probably a phasing out of the milk quota system before 2015, when the 2003 Agreement is due to expire. It was not Parliament that raised this issue now, but it is in Parliament that the issue must be clarified, because our voters are most concerned and are anxious to know what is going on.\nThe truth of the matter is that the market reacted to these statements immediately, and various organisations and political agents appeared in public to have their say on the future of milk quotas. Although the CAP health check cannot be viewed as a mid-term review, we are aware of the internal and external pressures to make changes that go beyond merely simplifying the processes. In the dairy sector, planning is done over the long term. As regards, on the one hand, quota acquisition and, on the other ha", "Signature of acts adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure\nPresident\nColleagues, we shall start with the signing of the Lex Citizens' initiative. Dear Minister Martonyi, President-in-Office, dear Chairs, rapporteurs, today we are considering legal matters: the very important signing into law of a very important piece of European legislation. It is important because we are giving another check to balance the powers of our institutions.\nThis regulation on the European Citizens' initiative, which has been adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure, aims at providing our citizens with the same political initiative that the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament already enjoy. One million signatures are needed - only 0.2% of our citizens - to invite the European Commission to act in matters that concern them directly. It allows them to be heard. I will indeed establish a direct link between the citizens and the Union's institutions, bridging the gap between them, between all of us in the European Union.\nThe European Parliament and the Council worked hard to achieve a rapid adoption of this citizen-friendly regulation at first reading. I would like to thank all those who contributed to this success: the various Presidencies - in particular the Belgian and Hungarian Presidencies -, the Commission and the Members of this House. I would like to give particular thanks to the Chairs of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO) and the Committee on Petitions (PETI), Carlo Casini and Erminia Mazzoni. I will ask you to come forward for the signing of the procedure. The four rapporteurs, Alain Lamassoure, Zita Gurmai, Diana Wallis and Gerald H\u00e4fner - I hope you are present and we can go through the procedure together - as well as the many other Members involved as shadow rapporteurs.\nYou can be proud of the work done for our citizens. With the Council we shall now sign this act into law but, before that, I will ask our guest, who will often be present ", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\nMr Medina Ortega has the floor.\n\nMedina Ortega\nMr President, this is just a question of a detail in the Minutes, but as it affects you too, I would like it to be corrected.\nReferring to my first speech, it specifically says, \"he called on the President of Parliament to confirm publicly that he had been present on that day, and had only caught a flight back to Spain at 3 p.m.' You normally travel with me, Mr President, but in fact on that particular day I think we both caught the 1 p.m. flight.\nThe Verbatim report of proceedings is correct in that I said, \"and for that reason, as I think the President is aware, I do not usually catch the special plane, but one which leaves at 3 p.m. in the afternoon, so that I can stay until 1 p.m.' In fact, on that particular day I flew at 1 p.m., because the sitting finished earlier. It is just a small detail.\n\nJanssen van Raay\nMr President, I appreciate your being present in Madrid on 12 October for our anti-racism match, although of course that is not my point. But I do want to thank you. My point is that as a Parliament we need to have access to our own legislative documents, which we do not have. I am writing to you on the subject today.\n\nEwing\nMr President, I rise to speak on the point raised by Mr Coates which is to be found on page 6 of the Minutes. I do not think this is an accurate Minute. In the first place, it merely states that Mr Coates raised a matter under the Rules. It does not minute that he raised the very important matter of the mandate of Members. There can be few matters as important as that.\nSecondly, the Minutes do not reflect the President's reply, which is also of great significance. He said that this was an internal matter. I would like to suggest that it is not an internal matter. If a Head of Government of this Union issues a restriction on Members, saying they may not discuss electoral ref", "Rules for the operation of air services in the Community (recast) (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the recommendation for second reading by Ar\u016bnas Degutis, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on common rules for the operation of air services in the Community (recast) (16160/4/2007 - C6-0176/2008 -.\nAr\u016bnas Degutis\nThe aim of this Regulation is the effective implementation of EU legislation on the internal air transport market. This is of critical importance for the effective and economic functioning of the air services market within the harmonised and coordinated rules.\nThis Regulation replaces and combines three existing regulations: the Regulation on the licensing of air carriers and the leasing of aircraft, the Regulation on free access for Community air carriers to intra-Community air routes and the Regulation on the liberalisation of air fares.\nThe Regulation we have in front of us today is for the most part based on experience acquired in the course of the implementation of relevant existing regulations.\nParliament completed its first reading of this Regulation in July 2007. The Council adopted its common position on 18 April 2008.\nAs rapporteur, I, together with the shadow rapporteurs, arranged in-depth discussions with interested parties and institutions. Moreover, after first reading in Parliament, we had several meetings with representatives of the country holding the Presidency of the Council to ensure that the issues we were working on were reflected in the common position.\nHaving thoroughly analysed the common position, I can confirm that it corresponds to the political agreement adopted by the Council last December, which reflects the issues that concern us fairly well.\nWith the aim of achieving appropriate implementation of social rights, reference is made in the annex to the document, based on the position of both the Commission and the Council, that the Member States should ensure adequate application of emplo", "Resumption of the session\nPresident.\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 19 June 2003.\n\nPresident.\nColleagues, it is my sad duty to inform you of the death, on Saturday, 21 June 2003, of Mr Pieter Dankert, President of the European Parliament from 1982 to 1984. Piet Dankert was the very model of a Parliamentarian - resolute, straightforward, plain-speaking - who served the interests of his electorate, his party and of the European Parliament.\nHis efforts to secure greater powers for the European Parliament gave us a position from which today we still derive daily benefits and influence in our work.\nAs President, Piet Dankert steered the course of the European Parliament during one of the most difficult phases of the Union's history. His own enterprising spirit and non-conformist approach, his constant concern for the man in the street and his own sense of humour and personality were defining characteristics of his presidency at that time.\nAs an historian Pieter Dankert never lost sight of the long-term view that gave him the vision and wisdom that Europe needed then and still needs today.\nOn behalf of the European Parliament I have expressed my profound respect and condolences to his family. I invite you to observe one minute's silence for our colleague Pieter Dankert.\n(The House rose and observed one minute's silence)\n\nVan den Berg (PSE).\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, Piet Dankert, from Stiens in Friesland, whose enthusiasm for social democracy had been kindled by his Frisian grandfather, started his career as a teacher, and made an important contribution in Europe in many roles, of which I should like to list a few examples.\nOpenness. The election of Piet Dankert to President of the European Parliament was the first time that a decision of such significance had not been reached internally among groups. The election was held in an open and almost professional manner, and included a press campaign. This action was ab", "1. A new framework strategy for multilingualism (vote) \n- Before the vote on paragraph 20:\nZbigniew Zaleski\n(ES) Mr President, in the event of paragraph 20 not being rejected, I propose an oral amendment:\n'Otherwise, lesser-used languages and less-recognised languages, particularly in Western Europe, of the new Member States, will be left behind with their linguistic social space taken over by the more widely spoken languages, especially English.'\n(Parliament rejected the oral amendment)\n", "3. Protection of the environment through criminal law (\n- Before the vote:\nJanez Lenar\u010di\u010d\nPresident-in-Office. - Mr President, once again, thank you very much. With your permission I would like to give the following statement on behalf of the Council.\nWe have considered the following amendment which the European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs has adopted. It is the new recital 12a.\nI quote: 'Where a continuing activity proves after a lapse of time to give rise to environmental damage which may in turn give rise to criminal liability under this Directive, the question whether or not the perpetrator of the damage acted intentionally or negligently should be determined by reference to the time when the perpetrator became aware, or should have been aware, of the facts constituting the offence and not to the time when the perpetrator commenced its activity. It should be borne in mind in this connection that the prior grant of an authorisation, licence or concession should not constitute a defence in such circumstances.' End of quote.\nWe understand the intentions that have been expressed in this amendment. These matters belong under the competence of the Member States. We believe that the Member States will duly take into consideration these intentions.\nThank you.\nOlli Rehn\nMember of the Commission. - Mr President, this declaration may not amount to the same rhetoric as Mr Cohn-Bendit's. I have to read this declaration and I quote: 'The Commission took note of the following amendment adopted in the Committee on Legal Affairs: \"Where a continuing activity proves after a lapse of time to give rise to environmental damage which may in turn give rise to criminal liability under this Directive, the question whether or not the perpetrator of the damage acted intentionally or negligently should be determined by reference to the time when the perpetrator became aware, or should have been aware, of the facts constituting the offence and not to the time when the perpetrato", "Production of opium for medical purposes in Afghanistan (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Cappato, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on production of opium for medical purposes in Afghanistan.\nMarco Cappato\nrapporteur. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in this report we propose that Parliament should take the initiative and make a proposal to the Council, primarily in the context of the common foreign and security policy, on the issue of opium production in Afghanistan.\nOur starting point is the realisation that the results achieved to date are inadequate. There has been a 50% increase in the production of opium used to produce heroin over the past two years. It seems that we are unable to find an effective means of reducing this enormous production mountain, all of which then goes to enrich not the growers, the farmers, of course, but the large international drug mafias, the terrorists and the Taliban.\nThe report also starts from another premise: that at the same time there is in fact a very severe lack of access to painkillers. Some 80% of the world's population has no access at all to painkillers. Of course, the two issues could be regarded as completely separate, but I believe it is the job of political institutions to be pragmatic and hence to understand that, faced with this enormous volume of production used for heroin - whilst a product from the same agricultural origin is in very short supply - it ought to be possible, as it were, to combine the two points of departure.\nThe amendments put forward in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and by Mrs Gomes on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, as well as those tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in plenary, have helped to ensure that the proposal on the table today is not an alternative one, that is, a negative proposa", "Media law in Hungary (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on media law in Hungary.\nNeelie Kroes\nVice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I am pleased to inform you that, when the plane was touching down this morning in Strasbourg, I got the good news that the Hungarian Prime Minister has agreed to amend the media law so that it complies with all aspects of EU law that we, the European Commission have raised, including the concerns raised regarding the Charter of Fundamental Rights.\nThey assure me that the amendments will be adopted by the Hungarian Government at its next session. The body language of the representatives of the Hungarian Government gives me the feeling that this is correct and that it will be tabled in the Hungarian Parliament within the coming days.\nThe four areas where the Hungarian authorities agreed to amend their law are the following.\nNumber one: balanced coverage. The amendments agreed would limit the balanced reporting requirements to broadcasting, as in other Member States, and would no longer apply those requirements to on-demand audiovisual media services or the written press. Moreover, any restrictions on broadcasters would need to respect the principle of proportionality. Of course the Commission will monitor the way that principle is translated into secondary law.\nI mentioned four areas. The second one is the country-of-origin principle. The amendments agreed would mean that foreign broadcasters could no longer be fined for breaching the Hungarian media law's provisions on protection of minors or incitement to hatred. Instead the Hungarian authorities could suspend transmission of such services on Hungarian territory, which is in line with the AVMS Directive.\nWhat does that mean? It means that broadcasters legally established and authorised in other Member States, and compliant with the laws of those countries, would be free to broadcast to Hungary without running the risk of being subject to fines by H", "MON 863 - Risk Management (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on MON 863 risk management.\nMarkos Kyprianou\nMember of the Commission. Mr President, the Commission has on many occasions declared - and, through its actions, proved - its commitment to ensuring that the legislative framework on genetically modified food and feed, which was approved by the European Parliament and the Council, is fully respected. We have the obligation - and I believe we are delivering on this obligation - to make sure that the legislation is properly and fully respected. Under the legislation, GM food and feed can be legally put on the market only if it is safe and appropriately labelled.\nI would remind the House of how the legislation provides for the division of work between risk assessment and risk management. The Commission has no discretion on the safety assessment of a GM product. The legislation clearly distinguishes between risk assessment, which is carried out by EFSA, and risk management, which is carried out by the Commission. This approach is defined not only by general food law but also by the Regulation on GM food and feed.\nWhenever new scientific questions emerge, the Commission adheres to the separation of competences and asks EFSA to evaluate the information and its impact on the risk assessment of a product. The Commission's role is to take relevant risk management decisions, provided that, and only when, such a risk is identified by EFSA as the European Union's body responsible for risk assessment. In other words, we manage a risk once it has been identified and assessed by the body responsible. It was a very specific decision, when the legislation was adopted, to give the risk assessment to a separate independent body. However, if there is no risk identified by the Authority, then there will be no sound scientific basis for the Commission to take a risk management decision.\nOn this specific issue, MON 863 had already been evaluated twice in 20", "Commission communication on Action against Cancer: European Partnership (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mr Peterle, on behalf of the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Commission communication on 'Action against Cancer: European Partnership' -.\nAlojz Peterle\nrapporteur. - (SL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with this report we are taking a stance on one of the most difficult problems of the European Union. The epidemic spread of cancer is making it the number one disease in the Union and one in three citizens of the Union will encounter it.\nI am pleased that, at the beginning of this term of office, it is not necessary to call on the Commission and the Council to take basic steps in order to combat cancer because we have the Council's clear conclusions of June 2008 and an ambitious project, the European Partnership for Action against Cancer, which the Commission presented in September 2009 and which forms the subject of this report. It is important to note that action is already underway. With this report we are supporting one of the most ambitious goals of the Commission, that we reduce the burden of cancer by 15% over a period of ten years.\nI am also pleased that the partnership was developed in accordance with our health strategy resolution 'Together for Health: A Strategic Approach for the EU 2008-2013'. In that resolution, we upheld the importance of health for all and of health in all policies and placed major emphasis on cancer prevention.\nIt is an astonishing and worrying fact that, on average, Member States invest a mere 3% of their health budgets in cancer prevention. While it might appear to be a statistical error, this figure means that the health policies of Member States do not take prevention very seriously. What we really need is a paradigm shift towards more prevention in our strategic, technical, organisational and financial approaches. We know this and also we know, and it has been", "Priorities in the fight against Alzheimer's disease (written declaration): see Minutes\n\nEva-Britt Svensson\n- (SV) I hope now that the whole of Parliament will listen. During the part-session in January, we unanimously adopted a resolution on the Horn of Africa. It contained a specific paragraph stating that Dawit Isaak should be released. Dawit Isaak is now extremely sick and I would like to ask the President to write to the Eritrean authorities.\nThe news of his illness has been confirmed by several sources and has been mentioned in the Swedish media today. The situation is extremely serious and desperate and I would just like to remind you that Dawit Isaak is a Swedish-Eritrean journalist who has been imprisoned without trial since 2001. His health problems are so serious now that he is being kept in a military hospital, and I fear for his life.\nI would appeal for support for the release of Dawit Isaak.\n(Applause)\nPresident\n- Mrs Svensson, I can confirm that the President will write accordingly.\n", "Opening of the sitting\n(The sitting opened at 9.00)\nMario Pirillo\n(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during the night of 18 October the town of Paola, the birthplace of Saint Francis, was hit by a violent rainstorm affecting the whole of Calabria: huge damage was caused to public buildings, private homes, water and sewage networks, and electricity and telephone networks, not to mention landslips and mudslides. Many families have had to leave their homes, and schools have remained closed.\nEpisodes such as this have been occurring in Calabria for a long time now, possibly due to the effects of climate change. A state of natural disaster will be declared shortly, and we hope that the European Solidarity Fund can be activated. I would like to express my solidarity - which I hope is shared by this House - with the entire population, including that of the neighbouring towns that have suffered damage.\nPresident\nOf course, we are taking good note of the information you have provided us with. We would like to express our solidarity and our concern about the disaster that has hit Calabria and, naturally, all the members of this Parliament declare their support to those affected in that beautiful region of Italy and Europe.\n", "Nuts and locust beans\nBautista Ojeda (Verts/ALE)\nMadam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for adopting this report by unanimity. In addition, I should like to recall Parliament's considerable institutional support to the nuts and locust beans sector. This is evidenced in a number of resolutions testifying to the significance of this sector within the Union.\nAt the Council of Agriculture Ministers in July 2001, Commissioner Fischler announced that a detailed study of the Community nuts sector would be undertaken. The Commissioner also stated that if appropriate, specific proposals to benefit the sector would be made, to follow on from the improvement plans expiring in 2001.\nIn the light of this situation, the Commission has proposed an additional one-year extension of the improvement plans. I have certainly welcomed this. Nonetheless, I would like to make it clear that I trust it will be the last transitional instrument, to be followed by a permanent proposal. Such a proposal must ensure the survival of the sector and put an end to the difficulties and uncertainty European Union producers are experiencing.\nThe main aim of our report was to settle the issue of permanent support measures once and for all. The nuts sector is very important to the Union from a social, economic and environmental point of view. Over a million hectares are devoted to these crops. They extend across the Mediterranean countries, and the land is mostly located in very disadvantaged areas where agriculture is difficult. Much of the soil is hillside or arid.\nThese products therefore have to overcome many difficulties to remain on the market and be economically viable without direct support from public institutions. The difficulties are exacerbated by strong outside competition. For instance, there are hazelnuts from Turkey and almonds from the United States. In both cases the conditions of production bear no comparison to those in Eu", "Question Hour with the President of the Commission\nPresident\nThe next item is Question Hour with the President of the Commission.\nManfred Weber\nMr President, allow me to begin with a smile as I congratulate all the Members for having survived the fire alarm and managing to take our places, safe and sound, back in the Chamber.\nAs a representative of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to pose a question to the President of the Commission, who has been busy dealing with the pictures that we have been seeing in recent weeks from the Mediterranean, where many people fleeing from the situation in Africa have made it to Europe, while some have also failed to make it. We have had to see the images of these stranded and dead people on the news.\nWe are all aware that it is a joint European challenge facing us to find an answer to this drama and this misery for refugees. On behalf of the PPE Group, I would like to ask the President of the Commission to give us an appraisal of whether the Commission - and, above all, Frontex - has enough resources, whether we, the European Union, have enough capabilities to respond on the ground, and whether we have enough statutory bases to enable Europe to act together in the Mediterranean region.\nI would also be interested to hear what form the discussions with the countries of origin (Tunisia and Egypt, for example) take and whether we Europeans are making headway in this area.\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso\nPresident of the Commission. - Mr Weber, we all regret recent events that have caused the loss of many lives. I agree with you on the need to take more decisive action in this field.\nThere was an immediate response to assist the countries in North Africa - more than EUR 1 million for humanitarian assistance - and this assistance will continue. Through the Hermes joint operation, the Frontex border agency is coordinating a response to the strong migratory pressure. However, it is very important that Member ", "2. The petitions process (Amendment of Title VIII of the Rules of Procedure) (\n- Before the vote:\nBrian Crowley\non behalf of the UEN Group. - Madam President, I apologise for interrupting the vote.\nUnder Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure, I am asking the Members of the House to postpone the vote on the Onesta report with regard to the petitions process, as this matter is at present being dealt with in the Conference of Presidents in the context of the reform of the procedures of the House. The Conference of Presidents will discuss the very specific reform issues dealt with in the Onesta report at a meeting on 5 March 2009, and I am asking that, if possible, the vote on this report be postponed until the Strasbourg part-session in the second week of March. I am asking the House to approve this if possible.\nG\u00e9rard Onesta\nrapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, let us try to be precise. This report amends our regulation, or rather clarifies it, in order to make it clear how petitions to the Committee on Petitions are received or not received, how information is given to petitioners, and so on.\nIt was approved unanimously, with one vote against I think, in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. I do not think, therefore, that this report is very controversial. There is, however, one article in which we had agreed to make it clear that if and when the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, petitioners would simply be informed if a petition that were submitted not to Parliament but to the European Commission - you know, those petitions with millions of signatures - were connected to their petition.\nIf I understand rightly, it is that article, because of the reference to a possible future treaty that causes a problem. Personally, I can live with postponing it until 5 March; I can even live with a 'speed vote' withdrawing that amendment. On the other hand, it would be very regrettable if we could not tidy up our regulation on this point when there have been so many problems in th", "18. 50th anniversary of the Tibetan uprising and dialogue between His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the Chinese Government (vote) \n- Before the vote:\nMarco Cappato\nMr President, I would like to request that the separate votes proposed for paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 be taken by roll call.\n- Before the vote on recital E:\nMarco Cappato\nI also request roll-call voting for the final vote.\n", "Support for strengthening the European Union ban on shark finning - Increased European Union support for grassroots sports - An EU homelessness strategy (Written declarations) \nPresident\nWritten declarations 0071/2010, 0062/2010 and 0061/2010 have been signed by a majority of the Members in this Parliament and therefore, pursuant to Rule 123(3) and (4) of the Rules of Procedure, they will be forwarded to their addressees and published in the adopted texts of this session, together with the signatories' names.\nSe\u00e1n Kelly\nMadam President, on behalf of my co-signatories, Ivo Belet, Hannu Takkula, Mary Honeyball and Joanna Senyszyn, I thank all the Members for signing this declaration. It was significant that almost 50% of the signatories were women, so I would like to thank them very much for their cooperation and also pay particular tribute to Joanna Senyszyn. She did stalwart work and she might like to say a few words as well.\nSo to everybody, I thank you and wish you all fun and games and lots of sport for Christmas.\nPresident\nThe next item is Written Declaration No 61/2010.\nKarima Delli\n(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is with some emotion and on behalf of my fellow Members, Mrs Thomsen, Mrs Lynne, Mrs Figueiredo and Mr Protasiewicz, that I would like to express my sincere thanks for your support of Written Declaration 61/2010 on an EU homelessness strategy.\nWhile today, the European Commission is presenting its flagship initiative - a European Platform against Poverty and Exclusion - this declaration sends a strong message from Parliament to the European Commission and Member States.\nThe time for talking is over. It is now time to act. Specific proposals can now be implemented. Let us make sure that we have put an end to rough sleeping by 2015.\nI wish you all a happy holiday and I believe we will get off to a good start next year.\n(Applause)\nPresident\nMr Besset has requested the floor. Please go ahead.\nJean-Paul Besset\n(FR) Madam President, on behalf", "Situation in Gaza\nPresident\nThe next item is the President's statement on the situation in Gaza. The chairs of the political groups will outline their respective positions on this issue. They have, however, asked me to make a statement too, and I have gladly acceded to their request.\nIn view of the escalation in the Middle East, there was an urgent need to put the current situation on the agenda once more. We Europeans are again asking ourselves what we can do, how we are to react to the spiral of violence that is causing the Middle East to flare up once again before our eyes.\nTo come straight to the point, the only response is the resolute pursuit and emphatic fast-tracking of the peace talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians. The peace process launched in Annapolis must not be destroyed by violence and terrorism. As Members of the European Parliament, we must do everything in our power to prevent that.\nThe television images of victims of the conflict that reach us daily are harrowing. If we were moved to sympathy and outrage a week ago by the sight of the innocent Palestinian civilians, including many children, who lost their lives in Gaza because of the disproportionate use of military force, since last Thursday's appalling murderous attack on a school in Jerusalem we have been sharing the sadness and anger of the Israeli population.\nSympathy is a noble virtue in politics too, but sympathy is not enough. Sympathy is no substitute for political action. Viable political solutions must be found rationally on the basis of clear principles. The protection of human life and respect for international law are embodiments of such principles, and they must therefore be our benchmarks.\nOn behalf of the European Parliament I strongly condemn the acts of violence perpetrated by Hamas and other Palestinian extremists. On behalf of the European Parliament I ask the Government of Israel to listen to the voices both within the country itself and beyond its borders that ar", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nLaima Liucija Andrikien\nMr President, I voted in favour of the agreement between the European Union and the United States to share financial data for the purposes of terrorist finance tracking.\nWe are well aware of the threat terrorism poses to our own security as well as that of our partners across the Atlantic. I do not need to remind you of all the terrorist attacks that have taken place on European soil throughout the last decade. It is also obvious that our American partners represent a very important strategic ally, not only in the area of global security, but also economically and in other areas as well.\nThe commitment to such a strategic partnership was clearly expressed by Vice President Joe Biden in this House just a few months ago. We should therefore be proud that we finally gave consent to the agreement that is so important for efforts to track terrorist activities, especially since the new agreement contains significant improvements, and clarifications made by the European Parliament have been largely taken into account.\nGerard Batten\nMr President, there are many reasons to vote against this resolution but too many to cover in just 60 seconds. We must of course oppose terrorism but that must not be used as an excuse for governments to spy on their citizens. The confidential information concerned belongs to the citizen, not to the European Union, the Parliament or indeed the nation state.\nAny such agreement should be concluded between sovereign nation states, answerable to their own people through the democratic process. In any case, this is a one-sided agreement and we have no reason to believe that the United States will honour it. The agreement breaks UK data protection law, which bans the sharing of information without consent between overseas third parties. The British Government has an opt-out clause on this, and I hope they overcome their usual spinelessness and oppose and vote against it in the same", "Commemoration of deportations in 1941 in the Baltic States\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, this month sees the 70th anniversary of mass deportations carried out by the Soviet authorities from the Baltic States, which they had occupied since 1940. These deportations were chiefly designed to deprive Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania of their social and political elite. Scientists and representatives of political circles were eliminated, and people who were famous for being free thinkers were eliminated too. Today, it is our common duty to cherish the memory of the hundreds of thousands of victims of the Soviet terror in the Baltic States, and to condemn in the strongest terms the totalitarian system and the crimes against humanity committed by its leaders. The suffering of the Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian nations gave them the determination and strength to fight for independence and to return to a united Europe half a century later.\nI also wanted to remind you that 22 June, in two weeks' time, will be the 70th anniversary of the attack on the Soviet Union by Hitler's Germany. This attack marked the severance of their previous alliance and the secret Hitler-Stalin pact of August 1939, which divided up Europe. We thus have a series of anniversaries which are important for us to remember, and for Europe to remember, but I believe that the presence of our fellow Members from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia proves that Europeans are able to conquer adversity and overcome huge tension, which is why we are very pleased to see our fellow Members here with us, particularly today.\nTunne Kelam\non behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, thank you for your kind words of solidarity.\nSeventy years ago, about 50 000 Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian nationals were brutally deported from their homes in the Soviet-occupied Baltic States. If we compare that figure of 50 000 out of the then 5.5 million population of the three Baltic States to that of the UK or France, the 50 000 Baltic dep", "Explanations of vote\nPresident\nThe next item is clarification on the voting method.\nPaul R\u00fcbig\n(DE) Mr President, may I ask that the temperature in the chamber be set at a humane level. At times it is so cold in here that we almost need to put on our coats. I ask the administration to ensure that we have a decent temperature in which to work. Thank you.\nPresident\nI would ask the staff responsible for the heating in the chamber to increase the temperature. It might go up anyway during this item of discussion.\nOral clarification concerning voting\nZuzana Roithov\u00e1\n- (CS) Mr Chairman, I welcome the fact that we gave the green light to the modern framework for further development of the automotive industry in Europe. I am pleased that we have voted for objectives that are realistic and that make provision for the increase in the price of oil and for our great ambitions regarding safety and protection of the environment. The objectives do not hinder Europe's ability to compete. Increasing requirements for safer and safer car designs and for more efficient engines that should emit one third less greenhouse gases are all objectives that already imply an increase in prices as well as an increase in the running costs of cars. We are aware that these requirements in themselves are not the main motivation for the middle classes and for the less affluent to change their cars more frequently. The elimination of old cars from the European roads is therefore the basic requirement if the CARS 21 is to prove its worth. The key is to change consumer motivation. Taxes and fiscal policies are not, however, entrusted to the European Union. It will therefore be up to the Member States to carry the responsibility for setting the parameters. It will be up to the Member States to determine whether and when safer and more environmentally-friendly cars will start taking the place of the old cars on our roads. That would also be real proof of the effectiveness of CARS 21.\nWritten clarification c", "Beniamino Donnici (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Giuseppe Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the verification of the credentials of Mr Beniamino Donnici.\nGiuseppe Gargani \nrapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to mention in this Chamber the work carried out in committee, which has thoroughly discussed the credentials of Mr Donnici, resulting in a large majority in favour of the report.\nI defend the committee, of which I have the great honour to be chairman, and I would like to answer those making petty insinuations to the effect that the committee has not been calm or objective - insinuations that clearly do nothing to honour this Parliament, given that the committee contains many jurists. We have people and jurists such as Mr Lehne, Mr Medina, Mrs Wallis and Mrs Frassoni, to mention just the coordinators, and also very many other prominent figures throughout the committee. Our discussions were always at a high level, and were conducted exhaustively and with great sincerity. We always focused primarily on the role of this Parliament, which is a giant in terms of many things that it does and its role in Europe, but a dwarf on some occasions when you want to force it into a procedural corner.\nThe issue we were discussing comes within this major issue: the facts are known, the withdrawal by Mr Occhetto infringes the European Act, and we cannot give Mr Donnici a positive verdict.\nThe rules governing the European election procedure fall within the Community's jurisdiction and therefore the reference to national provisions laid down in the 1976 European Act is of a solely supplementary character. The national provisions must, however, conform to the fundamental principals of the Community legal system, its primary rules and the spirit of the wording of the 1976 Act. For these reasons, the relevant legislative and administrative national authorities, as well as the jurisdictional authorities, may not o", "Promoting social inclusion and combating poverty (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Gabriele Zimmer, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on promoting social inclusion and combating poverty, including child poverty, in the EU.\nGabriele Zimmer\nMr President, firstly, I regret that, for the own-initiative report that I am to present on behalf of the committee, neither open debate in plenary nor amendments are possible. I find it unacceptable that Members of Parliament restrict their own rights in this way and devalue own-initiative reports.\nOur committee held very vigorous debates about the reports being presented today, with more than 200 amendments, 40 compromise amendments and two hearings for experts and stakeholders, all in close cooperation with the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. All this demonstrates the level of interest in this subject among Members.\nThe Committee on Employment and Social Affairs voted by an overwhelming majority across all groups to continue to develop the EU strategy for combating poverty and social exclusion and I hope that the entire plenary will do the same tomorrow. The committee makes it absolutely clear that, given the 78 million people living in poverty, including 19 million children, the EU and its Member States have an obligation to initiate specific, measurable goals to promote social integration and combat poverty.\nA few days ago, the Commission suggested principles for the strategy of active integration, which should be approved by the European Council. As a committee, we support these suggestions, to the extent that we were made aware of them in advance. We go further, however, and call in our report for the development of a holistic approach to active social integration.\nWe believe this must be based on four pillars: firstly, making incomes poverty-proof through minimum income benefits and minimum wages; secondly, active employment market policies for better ", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 2 March 2000.\n\nGr\u00f6ner\nMadam President, this is actually about an event which has taken place since the last sitting, a hearing held by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities. There was a grave danger of this House's reputation being damaged. You see, it emerged that during the plenary part-sessions there is a significant rise in prostitution in the area, in Strasbourg. I would cordially request that you look into this matter with the Strasbourg authorities and investigate whether criminal activity is at work here, and whether it is linked to trafficking in women and forced prostitution.\nI think that we need, as a matter of urgency, to send out a clear message to public opinion that we are doing something about this and I believe that the European Parliament cannot be indifferent to what is reported in public about what goes on on the fringes of plenary part-sessions.\n\nPresident\nThank you, Mrs Gr\u00f6ner. I would like to say that I was, like yourself, extremely shocked to hear this and immediately wrote to the Mayor of Strasbourg in order to get to the bottom of this issue. I fully agree with your remarks and have even been proactive in responding to your wishes. I will, of course, keep you updated on the reply that Mr Ries is bound to send me.\n\nBanotti\nWe get bad news in these points of order very often, but I have very good news for our Dutch colleagues. They now have two television channels.\n(Applause and laughter) The Quaestors are working hard on their behalf and we are waiting for the Finnish television channel. We have two German channels as well, so happy viewing everybody. I hope you enjoy it.\n\nPresident\nI am absolutely delighted, Mrs Banotti, and think that the Members concerned should thank our Quaestors wholeheartedly.\n\nRoure\nMadam President, I would simply like to add to what Mrs Gr\u00f6ner has said. We have indeed learned that during the pl", "Relations between EU and Switzerland (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Commission statement on relations between the European Union and Switzerland.\nJoaqu\u00edn Almunia\nMember of the Commission. (ES) Mr President, I am going to read the Commission statement on relations between the European Union and Switzerland, and although you and I speak the same language, I shall do so in English.\nMr President, the Commission is pleased that this item has been put on the agenda because it is now more than two years since we last discussed Switzerland. It was in 2004, on the occasion of the conclusion of the 10 new bilateral agreements. Let me start, therefore, with a general remark.\nThe bilateral and multilateral relations that link the EU and Switzerland are very good. Switzerland is a highly valued partner for the EU in many areas. Our bilateral relations are based on a solid foundation of around 20 important and over 100 smaller sector-specific agreements. These agreements range from free trade in goods and the free movement of persons to Swiss participation in our research and Schengen cooperation. Any existing differences should not have an inordinate impact on our relations.\nIn February, the Commission adopted a state aid decision on Swiss cantonal tax favours for certain types of companies, in particular holding companies. This decision has received much media attention in Switzerland and has been dramatised, by some, into a major conflict.\nLegally, the Commission has no doubts that the cantonal tax schemes qualify as subsidies, because these tax regimes offer unfair tax advantages to companies established in Switzerland for profits generated in the European Union. Income generated in Switzerland is taxed higher than profits made in the EU. This unequal treatment is at the heart of the state aid problem. The rules in question are liable to distort competition and may affect trade between Switzerland and the EU. All criteria of Article 23 of the agreement of 1972, the ", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 18 December 1998.\n\nOrder of business\nPresident\nThe next item is the order of business.\nThe final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents pursuant to Rule 95 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed. The following amendments have been proposed.\nStrasbourg\nMonday:\n\nPresident\nI would inform the House that I have received a second motion of censure on the Commission pursuant to Rule 34, tabled by Mr Fabre-Aubrespy and 68 other Members.\nWith the agreement of the authors of the motion and the Commission, I propose that this motion should be added to the joint debate on the other motion of censure and the oral questions on today's agenda.\nMr Striby has the floor.\n\nStriby\nMr President, once again I must raise the troublesome question I asked two months ago about when we are going to be moving into the IPE IV building. Rumour and hearsay are not good enough when it comes to Parliament's seat. We know that the matter has been settled in the Treaties, but in its physical dimension - bricks and mortar - it remains unresolved.\n\nPresident\nWe are dealing with the order of business, Mr Striby. The question of IPE IV and its completion has nothing to do with the agenda. You can table questions under Rule 28, and you no longer have the floor.\nMr Fabre-Aubrespy, do you agree that we should take your motion of censure together with the one which is already on the agenda?\n\nFabre-Aubrespy\nMr President, I think it is a good idea to have a joint debate because I would not want to force a new debate tomorrow morning, to be followed by a vote on Thursday, 48 hours later. I think it would be appropriate, given the formal nature of the procedure and the fact that the introduction of a motion of censure is exceptional, for the first signatories of the two motions, namely Mrs Green and myself, to speak first in this debate.\nThe motion you quote c", "Negotiations between the European Union and the United States with regard to visa exemptions (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on negotiations between the European Union and the United States with regard to visa exemptions.\nDragutin Mate\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (SL) I should like to briefly inform you of the progress of the visa waiver talks and the talks on ESTA. To begin with, I should like to say that, for the European Union, visa policy is an extremely important issue and that, ever since new Member States joined the European Union, both the Commission and all the presidencies have made huge efforts so that all countries and citizens would have to meet the same conditions for entry into the United States of America, and so that each of them would be included in the visa waiver programme. The abolition of visas would, of course, mean that all the citizens of the European Union are equal.\nThis year the USA have started with certain procedures, and have opened their doors for the visa waiver programme. They began with exclusively bilateral talks, and this is where some misapprehensions were encountered. Some intensive discussions were held which we, the Presidency, in conjunction with the Commission, clarified at the beginning of this year, and following a number of meetings a twin-track cooperation system in this area was agreed. This approach was also confirmed at the Trio's EU-USA meeting held in Slovenia on 12 March.\nA twin-track system means that the Commission is to be given a mandate to negotiate and to reach an agreement with the United States of America in connection with matters concerning the European Union, and at the same time all the countries can hold talks at a bilateral level concerning matters which fall within the competency of the Member States. On 18 April, at its latest session, the Justice and Internal Affairs Council also voted in favour of granting the Commission a mandate, so that now ", "Accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products - Common framework for the marketing of products - Application of certain national technical rules to products lawfully marketed in another Member State - Safety marking on consumer products (debate) \nPresident\n(FR) The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:\nreport by Andr\u00e9 Brie, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products - C6-0068/2007 -,\nreport by Christel Schaldemose, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and the Council on a common framework for the marketing of products - C6-0067/2007 -\nand the report by Alexander Stubb, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council laying down procedures relating to the application of certain national technical rules to products lawfully marketed in another Member State and repealing Decision 3052/95/CE - C6-0065/2007 -,\nas well as the following oral question:\noral question to the Commission by Arlene McCarthy, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, concerning safety marking on consumer products - B6-0009/2008).\nAndr\u00e9 Brie\nrapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, representatives of the Presidency, ladies and gentlemen, the subject matter and legal intricacies of the Regulation on accreditation and market surveillance are complex, and it has all the appearances of a very dry and largely technical instrument. There can be no doubt, however, that it has highly significant political implications for consumers and for the European economy as a whole. The problems which prompted the Commi", "Human Rights in the World 2007 and the EU's policy on the matter - EU Election Observation Missions (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following reports:\nthe Annual Report by Mr Cappato, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on Human Rights in the World 2007 and the European Union's policy on the matter;\nby Mr Salafranca S\u00e1nchez-Neyra and Mrs De Keyser, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on EU election observation missions: objectives, practices and future challenges.\nMarco Cappato\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, policies to promote human rights first of all require effective international policy-making powers, which the EU has. Unfortunately, all too often, as with the report that we unanimously approved in committee, European policy is in fact the policy of the Member States. It is difficult to have a European policy on human rights when Member States impose their national interests to this degree.\nHowever, when it comes to political will, and at times this is conquered thanks to the European Parliament, which has no international policy-making powers, we are able to make significant progress. Take the death penalty: three resolutions of this Parliament eventually secured an important European position for the moratorium on executions voted for at the United Nations in New York in December. Look at how Parliament proposed a European policy on Tibet with a resolution that we ratified at the last sitting.\nHuman rights instruments also exist, but all too often the European Union does not recognise their legality. We have human rights clauses in all of our cooperation agreements, and yet we do not have effective monitoring and temporary suspension mechanisms, because those clauses would really allow us to ensure respect for democracy in third countries.\nVery often we, as Europe, have been critical of the USA in recent years because promoting democracy through military means has proved ineffective. That is true! Howeve", "3. European SMEs in international trade (\n- Before the vote:\nCristiana Muscardini\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, please excuse me and accept my thanks for your patience.\nAs we know, the European Parliament has wished for many years to express its views on small and medium-sized enterprises, which represent 99% of all European companies and 75 million jobs, while today only 3% of these SMEs access the foreign, external market and only 8% access the internal market.\nWe are therefore asking the Council and the Commission to take account of these facts in multilateral and bilateral negotiations, in access to external markets, in the fight against counterfeiting, in the use of trade protection instruments and in competitive tendering. Trade is the key to greater prosperity.\nI would like to thank my colleagues at the Committee on International Trade and, most of all, the shadow rapporteurs of the two largest groups, Mrs Sa\u00effi and Mrs Locatelli, and offer my heartfelt thanks to the secretariat and to Dr Bendini in particular. I believe that after all our work, we are today handing shared thoughts and proposals to the Commission, on a topic close to Mrs Ashton's heart, as we heard from her opening speech as Commissioner, and one that must be tackled without delay if we want to resolve, at least in part, the serious economic and financial crisis that is haunting our workers and citizens.\n", "Health concerns associated with electromagnetic fields (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is a short presentation of the report by Mrs Ries, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on health concerns associated with electromagnetic fields.\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Ries\nMr President, before coming to the substance, I would like to say a word, if you would allow me, on the form. I am not the first and I shall certainly not be the last to speak out against Rule 45 of the Rules of Procedure, which prevents debate this evening on what is nonetheless a most important issue for the people of Europe.\nNo debate, no speakers on behalf of the groups, nothing. I would therefore like to thank, in spite of everything, and even though, I am sorry to say, they are not here, Mrs Ayala, Mrs Lucas, Mr Adamou, Mrs Sinnott, Mrs Ferreira and even Mr van Nistelrooij, who are without a Chamber, a virtually empty Chamber, at almost 11 p.m. Not bad either is the 11 p.m. slot for an issue that is of great interest and concerns millions of citizens in Europe.\nI come now to the substance. For ten years our Parliament had not taken up this issue. It was time, therefore, because 10 years is an age, or almost an age, when it comes to new technology: a boom in wireless devices, mobile phones, wifi, bluetooth, base stations, high-voltage power lines. These waves are all around us, bringing undeniable benefits, which I do not for a moment question in this report, but also, it has to be said, giving rise to serious questions with regard to their impact on our health.\nTherefore, let us be clear, it is in a somewhat sensitive area that I have had to prepare this report, with ever increasing controversy about the health risks of these low frequency waves and the inability of the scientific community, also, to reach an agreement.\nHere are a few examples of the ambitious proposals which, I hope, will be supported tomorrow: protection for areas that are at risk and vulnera", "Closure of sitting\nPresident\nAll that remains now is to thank our last six surviving fellow Members, our two courageous visitors in the gallery, the 15 or so officials and our 69 interpreters - there are more of them than all the spectators put together - for their participation.\n(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)\n", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nFrank Vanhecke\n(NL) Mr President, I should just like to say that I did not endorse the resolution on the EU/China human rights dialogue for a number of reasons. In particular, I think that we in this Hemicycle have already churned out more than enough overblown texts, and that the European institutions rarely, if ever, follow these overblown texts and overblown statements with action.\nWith the Beijing Olympic Games around the corner, their European Excellencies will be once more attempting to curry favour with the Chinese authorities. This is already clear from the present resolution, which, alongside very many sensible elements, asserts that, at the recent Chinese Communist Party National Congress - and I quote - 'perspectives ... arose towards the implementation of higher international human rights benchmarks'. How unworldly of this House; as the reality in today's Beijing is one of intimidation, deportations, arrests and labour camps. It is time the European Union abandoned its policy of double standards towards China.\nDimitar Stoyanov\n(BG) I voted against the resolution on extremism because it is the fruit of that hatred it is called upon to condemn. And who is lecturing us on extremism? Comrade Schulz and Comrade Cohn-Bendit, these champions of Marxism and Leninism, that very ideology which massacred dozens of millions of Russians and Ukrainians in the beginning of last century? Or Comrade Vigenin whose party held the Bulgarian people in its clutches for fifty years and killed thousands Bulgarians in its concentration camps? Are you the ones to teach us what extremism is like? Thank you.\nFrank Vanhecke\n(NL) Mr President, yes, that is the way it goes in this House.

We believe it could help. But we have said that there will be tough criteria for the next step. There must be a high level of consumer protection, higher than in many of our Member States. It must be easy and user-friendly for SMEs; it must give them a badge of honour to conduct their business under this optional contract and there must be no detriment to national law.\nThe process must be evidence-based, impact-assessed and with full parliamentary involvement, and on that basis, as I have said, the time for talking is over and we need to move forward. There are those who are nervous and say, well, let us just use the idea of a toolbox. Can I say to those who have that idea, be very careful, because I have a suspicion that a toolbox without an optional instrument is potentially actually more invasive of national law than a toolbox with an optional instrument that is voluntary, that respects the autonomy of the parties and is not detrimental to national law.\nLet us see something, as we move forward, that offers preventative justice for EU citizens and small businesses; that really gives us an instrument which means justice for growth.

The European Commission has confirmed this, as indeed did we last week, in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, without a single vote against. The expectations of the Albanian and Bosnian and Herzegovinian public, that tomorrow in this House, we will be giving the green light, are legitimate, and these people deserve that.\nI would like to welcome Mr Sven Alkalaj, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Mrs Jozefina Topalli, the Speaker of the Albanian Parliament, who are seated in the gallery and who are closely following this debate. It is time we sent out a message to these two countries: we are ready for you, you have met the conditions. We will knock down the visa walls that have divided the countries of the Western Balkans for far too long.\nWe have long struggled to achieve this common goal of ours and I would like to thank everyone who participated in this process, especially the European Commission and the Council. I am pleased that my own country, Slovenia, has played a very important role here.\nTo the people of Bosnia an", "Other business\nMario Mauro\n(IT) Mr President, I am speaking under Rule 173 of the Rules of Procedure. This evening, the Supreme Court of Brazil has refused the extradition of the multiple murderer, Cesare Battisti.\nNo less than two resolutions of this House have called for the contrary decision. I should therefore like to put on record, in addition to my own disappointment, my wish that Parliament's Bureau write to the Brazilian authorities declaring the disappointment of the entire European Parliament and, above all, expressing our solidarity and our grief to the families of the victims, who have been waiting for justice for thirty years.\nPresident\nI am grateful to Mr Mauro for that apt intervention ... (Mr Borghezio speaks without a microphone). I believe that the whole of this House shares the disappointment and the profound bitterness at the decisions that have been taken, and therefore I can only repeat what Parliament has already made clear on this issue on at least two occasions. Let us convey our indignation in this spirit of disappointment and with this clarity to the Brazilian authorities.\nLicia Ronzulli\n(IT) Mr President, I only need a few seconds to send my good wishes to Mrs Weisberger, who has recently become a mother and who is present here with her baby girl, as well as to all new mothers in this House, those who will become new mothers and those who, like me, work hard to be good mothers and good parliamentarians.\nIt is lovely to see how this Chamber has been enlivened by symbols of hope, but ... (the speaker was interrupted by disturbances in the Chamber). I am asking for your attention because it is important and I feel compelled to tell you what is on my mind. Let us see if you can manage to be more grown up, since in these last few days, I have unfortunately heard remarks such as 'Parliament is not a playground. This is not a playschool. Out with children and out with mothers'. Even worse, it has been said that 'the presence of children gives Me", "Economic and trade relations with Korea (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by David Martin, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the trade and economic relations with Korea.\nDavid Martin  \nrapporteur. - Mr President, this report had to be put together rather quickly, because we anticipated - we even hoped - that the Free Trade Agreement between the European Union and Korea might be concluded by the end of this year. That is clearly not going to be the case but, nevertheless, we are pleased that Parliament is able to report today and we hope, through our report today, that we will be able to influence the Commission's position.\nTo get to where we are today, some of my colleagues had to work extremely hard, and I would like to thank Christopher Ford from the Trade Committee and Emmanuelle Le Texier from the PSE Group, who worked above and beyond the normal call of duty to get this report prepared in time. I would also like to thank Commissioner Mandelson and his services for the good cooperation I have had from the Commission in producing this report, and also the Korean Ambassador, whose assistance enabled me to get an insight into the Korean position on these negotiations.\nHistorically, free trade agreements between the European Union and Asian countries have been trade-light, despite their name. I think this could be the exception to the rule. Korea has shown a willingness and an ability to negotiate a far-reaching and comprehensive bilateral trade agreement.\nKorea is a significant player in the region in Asia. It is now a wealthy country, the 11th largest economy in the world. Its per capita income is comparable to Spain. It is an economy that is growing quickly, and trade between our two regions - between Korea and the European Union - reached EUR 60 billion last year. So it is a deal worth doing, and, if we can get it right, I think it is a win-win situation. The Korean manufacturing industry, for example, can win through access to ", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nNeedle\nMr President, not specifically on the Minutes but on the Brussels Notebook which we have just found in our pigeonholes. This is a small but serious point: the notebook from the Session News Unit refers to important debates on economic and monetary union last evening. Obviously there is a good deal of interest in this Parliament on the British position on this subject.\nHowever, the printers of the relevant British parliamentary records and documents this week announced major redundancies with hundreds being made redundant in Norwich and elsewhere. That could seriously threaten the future availability of the information to this parliament and our Members. I would ask you to join me in contacting the newly privatized Stationery Office in Britain to seek clear assurances from them that all Members of this Parliament will be able to obtain the same service that has existed for our Members when it was a public body, namely proper access to all relevant documents of the British Parliament and Government, for example on economic and monetary union.\n\nPresident\nI do not think that the matter you have raised is within this Parliament's competence.\nWe will look into the matter and see if there is anything that we can do.\n(Parliament approved the Minutes)\n\nEmployment - social security - structural measures\nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following reports:\nA4-0369/96 by Mr Wolf, on behalf of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, on the Commission report: ' Employment in Europe - 1996' (COM(96)0485 - C4-0553/96) and on the communication from the Commission on the Action for Employment in Europe: a confidence pact (CSE(96)0001 - C4-0341/96); -A4-0278/96 by Mr Ribeiro, on behalf of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, on the proposal for a Council Regulation (COM(95)0735 - C4-0108/96-96/0001(CNS)) amending, for the benef", "Consolidating stability and prosperity in the Western Balkans - Situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the Western Balkans, and specifically the report by Mrs Ibrisagic, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on consolidating stability and prosperity in the Western Balkans and the statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nAnna Ibrisagic\nrapporteur. - (SV) Madam President, it is almost 15 years since the end of the war in Bosnia and almost exactly ten years since NATO's bombing campaign forced Serbian forces to leave Kosovo. In December, it will also be 17 years since I, myself, came to Sweden as a refugee from the war that set my former homeland alight and made bitter enemies of the Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs who had previously lived together as neighbours. The fact that neither Bosnia, Kosovo nor any of the other countries in the Western Balkans has relapsed into war since then is entirely down to the EU and NATO. However, even though the weapons have fallen silent, the legacy of the war lives on in politics and society in the region. The only chance for people in these countries to overcome their past is for them to continue along the path towards EU membership. Only the carrot and the stick that constitute the key dynamics of the accession process can get the governments of these countries to focus on carrying out the work and the reforms which, once and for all, can consolidate stability and prosperity in the Western Balkans.\nIn the report that I have written on this subject, and which the European Parliament will vote on tomorrow, I examine the various initiatives and projects that the EU and its Member States are involved in in one way or another in order to attempt to develop societies that are prepared to meet the stringent requirements of EU membership. I do not intend to go into the details of the report here, but there are two things in particular ", "4. Situation in the Horn of Africa (vote) \n- Before the vote:\nAna Maria Gomes\n(PT) I would like to propose a new paragraph before paragraph 1 that states as follows:\n'Notes that the current situation in the countries of the Horn of Africa is not in conformity with the essential elements of cooperation stated in Article 9 of the Cotonou Agreement;'.\nThis is a sentence that was already in the report that our three colleagues, who visited the region, recently gave to us.\n", "Institutional aspects of Regulatory Agencies (short presentation) \nPresident\nThe next item is a brief presentation of the report by Mr Papastamkos, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on a strategy for the future settlement of the institutional aspects of Regulatory Agencies.\nGeorgios Papastamkos\nrapporteur. - (EL) Mr President, the 29 European regulatory agencies constitute what at first sight appear to be micro-institutions but which, in essence, have an obvious macro-impact and which have already become an accepted para-institutional component of the European Union.\nThe excessive increase in the number of regulatory agencies has undoubtedly resulted in inflated European regulatory intervention, the fragmentation of and a lack of transparency in European policies and, by extension, has made operational coordination more difficult.\nFor all European agencies, the urgent question arises of the need for an interim review of their work and performance. What is required is a minimum total of common principles and rules relating to the structure, operation and control of the regulatory agencies, so that they integrate harmoniously within the framework of fundamental principles which derive from the Treaties.\nFollowing the Council's refusal to accept a legally binding instrument and the rejection of the proposal to conclude an interinstitutional agreement, the Commission decided to propose the establishment of an interinstitutional working group tasked with drawing up a common framework for the regulatory institutions and defining the competence of each of the European institutions vis-\u00e0-vis those agencies.\nI consider that this proposal falls short of the European Parliament's expectations of achieving an interinstitutional agreement. The common approach is indeed an interim step towards the adoption of a legally binding text. I do, of course, appreciate the Commission's wish to find a way out of a situation of protracted interinstitutional inertia.

I would be grateful if you could have this oversight remedied.\n\nPresident\nMr Santini, that will be corrected.\n(The Minutes were approved)\n  \n\nDe Rossa\nMr President, I sat here throughout the debate yesterday on the statements by the Commission and the Council in relation to the tragedy in the United States. Not a single mention was made of the crisis being faced by the aviation industry in Europe as a result of this atrocity. It is incumbent on this House to make clear to the Commission and the Council that aid needs to be provided to the European airline industry and to the aviation industry in general, so that we can maintain a European aviation industry, particularly our airlines. Otherwise, we would be in a very serious situation, particularly if, as is proposed, the United States provides aid to their airlines. It is of the utmost importance that the tens of thousands of jobs currently under threat in the aviation industry are saved.\n\nPresident\nMr De Rossa, we have noted your comments. The agenda for the next session will be set by the Conference of Presidents. We will put forward your suggestion.\n\nDecisions on freezing assets or evidence\nPresident\nThe next item is the report (A5-0274/2991) by Mr Marinho, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative by the governments of the French Republic, the Kingdom of Sweden and the Kingdom of Belgium for the adoption by the Council of a Framework Decision on the execution in the European Union of orders freezing assets or evidence (5126/2001 - C5\u00ad0055/2001 - 2001/0803(CNS)).\n\nMarinho\nMr President, this report concerns the recognition by one Member State of order", "EC-Gabon Fisheries Partnership (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Stavros Arnaoutakis, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Gabonese Republic - C6-0303/2006 -.\nJ\u00e1n Fige\u013e\nMr President, the Community and the Republic of Gabon have negotiated and initialled, on 28 October 2005, a Fisheries Partnership Agreement for a period of six years. The new Protocol has been in provisional application since December 2005 under a decision of the Council. On the date of its entry into force, this Agreement will repeal and replace the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Gabon on fishing off the coast of Gabon, which entered into force in December 1998.\nThe financial contribution is fixed at EUR 860 000 per year. Of this financial contribution, 60% will allow annual financial support for defining and implementing a sectoral fisheries policy in Gabon, with a view to introducing responsible and sustainable fishing.\nThis new Protocol provides fishing possibilities for 24 tuna seiners and 16 surface long-liners, with an annual reference tonnage of 11 000 tonnes.\nThe Agreement is part of an important network of EC Tuna Agreements in the Atlantic Ocean off the Western African coast.\nThe Commission considers that the Agreement will give the Community and Gabon an appropriate legal and political framework for monitoring and controlling the activities of the EU fleet in the Gabonese fishing area. It also allows the Community to support the development of the sector in this country, for the mutual benefit of the parties.\nStavros Arnaoutakis \nMr President, the European Union and the Gabonese Republic negotiated and signed on 28 October 2005 a multiannual fisheries partnership agreement which will cover relations between the European Community and the Gabonese Republic in the fisheries sector. The partnership", "4. Farm structure surveys and the survey on agricultural production methods (\n- Before the vote:\nG\u00e1bor Harangoz\u00f3\nrapporteur. - (HU) Thank you, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, farm structure surveys are some of the oldest Community-level statistical surveys, and they provide substantial and necessary information on agricultural holdings in the European Union.\nEspecially now that we have an enlarged EU that includes twelve new Member States, and since we are working at this very moment on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, it is exceedingly important to be able to conduct a new and comprehensive survey as soon as possible. We need comparable and uniform data to enable us to devise an equitable and properly functioning agricultural policy. This is why I have tried to ensure that we will be able to reach an agreement at the first reading, and get these surveys under way as soon as possible.\nI would especially like to thank my fellow Members who participated in the trialogue for their exceptionally constructive approach; I would particularly like to thank Mrs Elisabeth Jeggle and Messrs Nicolas Meves and Alexis Kuhl for their work. The amendments tabled as a result of the trialogue have been put into block one. I would ask you all to support the amendments in block one and then we will be able to close this dossier. Many thanks.\n", "Upcoming EU-US summit and Transatlantic Economic Council - EU-US Data Protection Agreement (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on the following:\nCouncil and Commission statements on the upcoming EU-US summit and the meeting of the Transatlantic Economic Council and\nCouncil and Commission statements on the EU-US data protection agreement.\nStefaan De Clerck\nMr President, Mrs Reding, Commissioner, honourable Members, as you know, the debate on the cooperation between the United States and the EU has been ongoing for some time now and, notably, we received a Commission proposal on 28 May 2010 requesting approval for the opening of negotiations on an agreement between the European Union and the United States on the protection of personal data, a subject that has been discussed several times before, including in this House.\nAt the same time, the Commission has been acting on the work of the EU-US High-Level Contact Group on Data Protection and Data Sharing, which drew up a report in 2008 that was also made available to the European Parliament. The data protection discussed in that report is, of course, a fundamental subject as far as Europe is concerned. It is a fundamental freedom which is enshrined in Article 16 of the treaty, and to which the Presidency attaches particular importance. Therefore, the Presidency supports all initiatives aimed at improving data protection in transatlantic relations and at ensuring an adequate level of such protection.\nThis agreement should take account of the data protection principles laid down in various documents: the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the 1995 Data Protection Directive and the 2008 Framework Decision. I said we need to achieve an adequate level of data protection, and this must be interpreted as not always being an equivalent or identical one.\nThere must be a high, adequate level of protection of the rights of the individual, but the way in which these rights are guaranteed may diff", "2. Southern Neighbourhood, and Libya in particular, including humanitarian aspects (\nAna Gomes\n(PT) Mr President, there is a new supervening element that is not reflected in the resolution, and I call upon Parliament to join me in expressing our indignation and concern. This concerns what happened to the team of BBC journalists who were illegally detained and tortured, and also subjected to mock executions, and who saw many other Libyans detained in prison in totally inhumane conditions.\nThis also shows that journalists are not being allowed to carry out their work freely in Libya. This is an important matter, and I call upon Parliament to join us in expressing our indignation and concern, which we must convey to the Council.\nPresident\nMrs Gomes, do you have a specific amendment in mind? We can only give consideration to a specific amendment, not a general appeal.\nAna Gomes\n(PT) Mr President, the information I have is that the Liberal Group should like to propose the oral amendment, which has been agreed, but if this is not the case, I will be more than happy to pass it on.\nPresident\nAll right, I understand. It is a general comment. Thank you.\nMicha\u0142 Tomasz Kami\u0144ski\n(PL) Mr President, with respect, we heard you say that the resolution has been adopted, but I did not see the result, at least not on my screen or on the one in the seat in front of me. I think we should also be given the results, by which I mean the particular result of this vote.\nPresident\nHere is the result: 316 people voted in favour, 264 voted against and 33 people abstained.\nJ\u00f3zsef Sz\u00e1jer\nMr President, I would like to remind the House of the double standards which we are applying. In the case of the Hungarian media law, an event which took place on Monday was not reflected in our resolution.\nNow we are trying to include something which happened only yesterday. This is a clear double standard which this House is applying, which is deplorable and unacceptable.\nGuy Verhofstadt\nMr President, I do this ", "CAP 'Health Check' (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Lutz Goepel, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the CAP 'Health Check'.\nLutz Goepel\nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the first round of parliamentary discussions on what is referred to as the health check of the common agricultural policy will conclude tomorrow. This health check is not a fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy. It should further update the existing policy where appropriate, based on the experience gained since 2003, and adapt it to changed circumstances.\nThe Commission should take very serious note of our position. It is a good basis for the upcoming negotiations on the legislative package, as well as for the budget review after 2013.\nWe in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have supported the continuation of the reform towards greater personal responsibility and market orientation while at the same time emphasising the aspects of food safety and of social and environmental responsibility - particularly with regard to current market development and the new challenges of climate policy - more strongly than we have done in the past. We also want greater flexibility for the Member States when changing the system - in other words, more opportunities to introduce further decoupling and the loosening of historical reference levels.\nThe debates in our committee have also revealed, however, that this is not sensible in all sectors, at least not before 2013. For livestock premiums or for states with full decoupling, but which have a strong livestock sector, a sudden change of system would result in negative structural interruptions in view of the current market situation. The same appears to be true with some of the smaller market regulations in the plant sector, such as, for example, the market regulations for potato starch, dry green fodder or rice, on wh", "One-minute speeches on matters of political importance\nPresident\nThe next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.\nRare\u015f-Lucian Niculescu\n(RO) The first European Summit on Roma integration took place last week right here in Brussels. The inclusion of this complex issue, that of the Roma, on the EU agenda is an idea which Romania has constantly supported, and I believe it should be welcomed. The Council of Europe, which has been concerned with this issue since 1990, remarked that the Roma constitute a genuine European minority. Therefore, the Roma issue is a European, not a national one, and I believe that the European Commission should have the Parliament's full support for its initiative.\nI believe that the European Parliament should speak in favour of placing education at the very core of the European policy concerning the Roma, because the experience of recent years has proven education to be the surest way towards integration and towards the successful overcoming of obstacles both by the Roma and by their neighbours.\nCsaba S\u00e1ndor Tabajdi\n(HU) Mr President, today we are witness to a gross infringement of the ban on market discrimination on the part of German and Austrian supermarket chains that are boycotting the Hungarian poultry farming and processing industry.\nThis involves the REWE, SPAR, METRO and Kaufland supermarkets, which are not taking delivery of Hungarian products in the wake of a boycott by an Austrian animal rights organisation. Consequently, this has caused a loss of 2 billion forints to the Hungarian poultry sector. They are using racial discrimination against Hungarian products, and thus violating the European Union's competition laws.\nThose affected will therefore turn to the European Court of Justice, since two of the Union's fundamental principles are being violated: the ban on racial discrimination, and equality and freedom of competition. Thank you for your attention.\nFiliz Hakaeva Hyusmenova\n(BG) Mr President, esteeme", "1. Recent attacks on religious minorities in Egypt and in Malaysia\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the motion for a resolution on the recent attacks against religious minorities in Egypt and Malaysia.\nMarietje Schaake\nauthor. - Mr President, in the week of Egyptian Orthodox Christmas, an attack took place killing and wounding 20 Coptic Egyptians. Although the attack can be seen as a criminal act of individuals, various other troubling incidents require our ongoing focus on respect for all minorities in Egypt.\nViolence and hatred cannot be accepted in the name of religion. People have a universal right to freedom of religion as well as freedom from religion. Ethnic and religious diversity asks for a vigilant society that is able to reconcile differences in open debate, a society where people of any background or conviction know that their freedoms are guaranteed.\nAn open society can only be realised when the separation of religion and state is implemented in the constitution and throughout the system of government. Security measures cannot be the only means to manage a pluralist society. Yet state emergency laws have been in place in Egypt for the past 28 years. A free debate is perhaps the most powerful medicine against extremism and violence. Therefore, freedom of expression, both online and offline, can be seen as the Egyptian Government's best tool to resolve tensions in society.\nIt is therefore very difficult to understand or accept that around 30 activists, politicians and bloggers were arrested by government forces while travelling to the southern Egyptian town of Nag Hammadi to express their condolences to the families of those killed during the sectarian violence. The arrests are a particularly striking example of what has become a pattern of the Egyptian Government's interference in citizens' rights to freedom of expression.\nSomething is desperately wrong when people are treated like criminals merely for attempting to show sympathy and solidarity w", "Opening of the sitting\n(The sitting was opened at 10 a.m.)\n\nAntonio Tajani\n(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has lost one of its greatest artists today. Luciano Pavarotti died this morning in Modena, and I think it only right to pay tribute to this great man of art and culture who took European music to the entire world. His passing is a huge loss to the European Union as a whole, and I believe it fitting to remember Luciano Pavarotti in this House.\n", "Adequate, sustainable and safe European pension systems (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on 'Towards adequate, sustainable and safe European pension systems'.\nRia Oomen-Ruijten\nrapporteur. - (NL) Madam President, allow me to start this debate by thanking my colleagues for their extremely pleasant and fruitful cooperation. I would also like to extend those thanks to the advisors of the parliamentary secretariats and, of course, our own staff.\nIt was not easy to manage such a large number of amendments. I still think that we have been successful, however, because we have now come up with something concrete in response to the Green Paper. A secure, sustainable and adequate pension, which is the guarantee that European citizens want. It is not as simple as that, however, as pensions are, and will remain, the responsibility of Member States.\nHowever, that does not mean that we are not allowed to express our opinions or table any proposals through the open coordination method, which may entail revision.\nThe sustainability of pension systems is under threat, with an inverted population pyramid being the trend: we now have more older people, senior citizens are living longer and therefore, fewer people are left to finance the pensions. The pay-as-you-go systems of the first pillar are the perfect expression of the solidarity between the generations, and they will continue to remain the most important in the future, too.\nHowever, on top of the burden on the younger generation, there is undeniably also a pressure on collective budgets and that, in turn, is having repercussions on the Stability Pact, whether we like it or not.\nMember States are raising their retirement ages. I am rejecting the proposals for European indexation of pensions to increased life expectancy. I am doing that because of significant variations in life expectancy between Member States and because, even if we", "\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013 We were all deeply shocked at the tragic news of the bomb attack on the Italian base in Nasiriya on 12 November 2003 and the death toll that now stands at 27 people: 19 Italians, 8 Iraqis and many wounded.\nThose young men and women, dedicated , were enthusiastic and committed to their mission, which was to assure peace and relieve the suffering of the population in that war-torn region. 19 have now returned to their homeland in coffins shrouded with the Italian tricolour.\nI have already expressed, on your behalf, our sympathy to the families of those victims, to the President of the Italian Republic, Mr Ciampi, to the Prime Minister, Mr\u00a0Berlusconi, to the Defence Minister, Mr Martino, to the police and armed forces, and of course to the people of Italy. Our hearts also go out to those wounded in this attack, for their personal suffering and the tragic loss of their friends and colleagues.\nOn behalf of the European Parliament, I express our profound indignation and utter condemnation of this attack.

It is a solemn occasion in the work of our institutions, when, traditionally, we take stock of the situation and cast an eye together over the work the Commission plans to do in the coming year. I am sad to say that, this year, our hearts and minds are greatly troubled by the tragic events that have dominated the news in recent days. I am referring to the series of acts of violence t", "9. Lisbon Strategy (European Council of 8 and 9 March 2007) (vote) \nStephen Hughes\nMr President, it is a very straightforward oral amendment. In the second line there is a phrase beginning 'have made it clear that no source of energy must be left unused'. We want to insert three words so it would read, 'have made it clear that no sustainable and safe source of energy must be left unused'.\n(The oral amendment was accepted)\n", "Statements by the President\nPresident\nIt is with great sadness that I have to inform you of the tragic death of Mrs Juarez Boal, deputy head of the European Union Delegation to Haiti. Mrs Juarez Boal formerly worked in the European Parliament, until 2002. She died in the tragic earthquake which struck Haiti on 12 January. The total number of victims of the earthquake may be as high as 200 000 people. You will recall that, during the last session a month ago, we observed a one-minute silence in memory of all those who died in the earthquake. We did not then know, we were not sure, that among them was a person so closely associated with the European Parliament and the work of the European Union - Mrs Juarez Boal.\nYesterday, the second round of presidential elections was held in Ukraine. While waiting for official confirmation of the results of the vote, I would like to congratulate the people of Ukraine for conducting free and transparent elections. This is what the reports from Ukraine are saying. I still have not had an official communication, but the statements of our fellow Members of the European Parliament who observed the elections say that apart from a certain number of complaints and what were, certainly, breaches of electoral rules, the absolute majority of the actions of everyone associated with the elections were in accordance with procedure and met the standards of democratic elections. This is a very great achievement for Ukraine. We recall that, five years ago, it was completely different. Today, our wish for Ukraine is that a democratically and peacefully elected President will act for the good of the country. We also want to establish the best possible relations with Ukraine. Despite the high degree of political instability in recent years, it can be seen that democracy in Ukraine has solid foundations.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to call upon all political forces in Ukraine to overcome their differences and begin to work together on so", "23. Evaluation mechanism to verify the application of the Schengen acquis (\nKarel De Gucht\nMr President, the scenario is the same. Therefore, the Commission's position is identical.\nPresident\nWell then, I think that obviously this second report will also be referred back to committee, as the European Commission has decided to maintain its proposal.\n", "\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The next item is the statements by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Commission on the Middle East. \nSolana,\n\u00a0\u00a0 Mr\u00a0President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you once again for giving me the opportunity of coming before a plenary sitting of the House. I am here to address you on what is currently a highly topical issue, namely the Middle\u00a0East. I know this is an area of great concern to you all.\nThe Middle\u00a0East is giving us cause for alarm once again. Yesterday, the Committee on Foreign\u00a0Affairs, Human\u00a0Rights, Common\u00a0Security and Defence\u00a0Policy adopted the report drawn up by Mr\u00a0Menendez\u00a0del\u00a0Valle. This sent out a further signal of Parliament\u2019s strong determination to be actively involved in the peace effort. I am confident this report will be most helpful in the search for peace. It has indeed already proved its worth.\nI have held several discussions with Mr\u00a0Menendez\u00a0del\u00a0Valle. We worked together to ensure the report contained the elements that could help to find a solution in line with the European approach.\nThe last few weeks amounted to a respite. They were characterised by tense calm. Sadly, that calm proved all too fragile. It was shattered dramatically by the events of recent days. We have received yet another reminder of the extent to which tension, violence, destruction and death are part of daily life in the region.\nMr\u00a0President, ladies and gentlemen, I am bound to admit to you that I too am overcome by a feeling of frustration. I am frustrated because the Middle\u00a0East is still bleeding to death. Life after life is still being lost needlessly.\nI am frustrated also because the Israelis and Palestinians have been unable or unwilling to meet the solemn undertakings given at Aqaba a few short weeks ago. I am frustrated because tension in the region has risen to alarming levels. I am frustrated because fewer and fewer people now believe the solution lies in the Road\u00a0Map sponsored by the Quartet. A", "Welcome\nPresident\nBefore I give you the floor, Commissioner, let me first extend a welcome on behalf of this House to the members of a delegation from the People's Consultative Assembly of the Republic of Indonesia, who have just taken their seats in the official gallery above.\nI would like to extend a very warm and special welcome to all of the delegation headed by His Excellency, Dr Lukman Hakim Saifuddin, the Vice-Chair of the People's Consultative Assembly.\nIndonesia is a key EU partner in South-East Asia. Indeed, it is the leading country in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), with whom the European Union signed a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement in November 2009, and currently holds the chair of ASEAN.\nOur two parliaments have an excellent relationship. A delegation from Parliament visited Indonesia just a few months ago. It is therefore a great pleasure to be able to welcome our friends and counterparts from the Indonesian Parliament today. We hope that your visit will be fruitful and beneficial.\n(Applause)\n", "6. Commemorating 11 July as a day of remembrance for the victims of the massacre in Srebrenica (vote) \nBefore the vote - concerns paragraph 3:\nDoris Pack\n(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, everyone has agreed to an addition to paragraph 3. We should like to add the following phrase to this paragraph, which concerns the work of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague:\n'reiterates in that regard that increased attention needs to be paid to war crime trials at domestic level;'.\n", "Improving the method for consulting Parliament in procedures relating to enlargement of the euro area - Adoption by Cyprus of the single currency on 1 January 2008 - Adoption by Malta of the single currency on 1 January 2008 (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on\nthe Council and Commission statements on improving the method for consulting Parliament in procedures relating to enlargement of the euro area,\nthe report by Werner Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision in accordance with Article 122(2) of the Treaty on the adoption by Cyprus of the single currency on 1 January 2008 - C6-0151/2007 -, and\nthe report by Werner Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision in accordance with Article 122(2) of the Treaty on the adoption by Malta of the single currency on 1 January 2008 - C6-0150/2007 -.\nG\u00fcnter Gloser\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we begin this debate, which is about procedural issues, we should firstly not forget the pleasing conclusions of the Convergence Reports published by the Commission and the European Central Bank on Cyprus and Malta. The Presidency is delighted that the Commission was able to establish that Cyprus and Malta have reached a high level of durable convergence and that, on this basis, it has been able to table proposals for the euro to be introduced in these two countries.\nAt the meeting of the Economic and Financial Council on 5 June 2007, ministers endorsed the Commission's assessment that Cyprus and Malta meet the conditions for the euro to be introduced.\nThe Presidency would therefore be very glad if Cyprus and Malta's success were not overshadowed by procedural issues and if the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council could reach an amicable solution.\nIt is in all of our interests to avoid delaying or creating a", "Order of business\nPresident\nThe final version of the draft agenda for this session, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 5 July 2007 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed. The following amendments have been proposed:\nMonday and Tuesday:\nNo amendments\nWednesday:\nThe Socialist Group, the Liberal Group and the Group of the European United Left propose that Mr Markov's report on road infrastructure safety management be referred back to the committee responsible in accordance with Rule 168.\nBrian Simpson\nMr President, I would like to speak in favour of referring this report back to the committee. There was a lot of concern in committee when the vote was taken to reject this proposal and no doubt the groups involved had reasons for doing that, but one of the consequences was that many road safety issues were then rejected also. Rather than go through the whole procedure in this plenary, my group and I feel that it would be far better if we refer the whole Markov report back to committee as of today, take it off the agenda and basically start again with our discussions between all the groups in the hope that we can come to a proper solution.\n(Parliament adopted the motion)\nThursday:\nNo amendments\n(The order of business was adopted)\n\nMartin Schulz\n(DE) Mr President, I crave your forbearance because I do not know which Rule of the Rules of Procedure I am speaking under. But I am sure that in your infinite wisdom you will find the right one.\nWe have a number of debates in this House about Parliament's calendar of meetings. There is a very great need for coordination between the political groups. The deadline for the tabling of amendments is 10 a.m. tomorrow. On behalf of our group, but also with the agreement of other group chairmen and colleagues, I propose that the deadline be extended to 6 p.m. tomorrow. That might give us time to resolve one or two serious problems, including organisational ones.\nPr", "Election of Quaestors of Parliament\nPresident\nThe next item on the agenda is the election of the Quaestors of the European Parliament.\nI have received notice of the following candidacies:\nMia de Vits\nSzabolcs Fazakas\nIngo Friedrich\nAstrid Lulling\nJan Mulder\nJames Nicholson\nThe candidates have informed me that they each accept their nomination as candidates.\nAs the number of candidates does not exceed the number of vacancies, I propose that they be elected by acclamation in accordance with Rule 12(1) of the Rules of Procedure, albeit with their seniority then being determined by an electronic vote.\n(Applause)\nI therefore declare all the candidates elected quaestors of the European Parliament, again congratulating all these Members on their election and wishing us good cooperation in the Bureau.\nWe will now proceed to determine the quaestors' seniority by secret electronic ballot. Since all we need to do is to determine their seniority, this vote does not require a qualified majority.\n- Following the vote:\nLadies and gentlemen,\nI now present the result of the vote for the quaestors.\nVotes cast: 669\nVoid or invalid voting slips: 16\nValid votes: 653.\nThe votes were cast as follows:\nJames Nicholson: 334 votes\nAstrid Lulling: 298 votes\nMia De Vits: 285 votes\nIngo Friedrich: 280 votes\nSzabolcs Fazakas: 267 votes\nJan Mulder: 265 votes\nIn accordance with Rules 15 and 14(2) of the Rules of Procedure, the Quaestors rank in order of the votes cast for them.\nCongratulations!\nThat means that we can now announce the composition of the new Bureau and the names of the Quaestors to the institutions of the European Communities.\n", "Guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States\nPresident.\nThe next item is the report (A5-0187/2003) by Mr Herman Schmid on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the proposal for a Council decision on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States (COM(2003) 176 - C5-0180/2003 - 2003/0068(CNS)).\nVitorino\n. Mr President, it is a pleasure to participate in this debate on behalf of the Commission and, above all, on behalf of Mrs Diamantopoulou, who regrets that she cannot be here today because she is attending a meeting of the Social Affairs Council in Luxembourg.\nWe have now reached the final stage in our joint effort to reform the European employment strategy. All the institutions have worked together to reach a good compromise that is now fully in line with the European Council's conclusions, that takes on board most of the European Parliament's views and that is, whilst less ambitious, close to the Commission's initial proposal.\nOur ambitions should reflect the scale of the challenges we face. Firstly, full employment: to deliver full employment we need to create up to 22 million jobs if the Union of 25 Member States is to reach the 2010 Lisbon target.\nAs far as quality and productivity is concerned, this means ensuring not just more jobs but also better jobs. We must take a positive approach to managing economic restructuring and we must reverse the slowdown in productivity growth.\nAs regards cohesion and inclusion, we must tackle increasing social inequalities and persistent regional disparities. This, of course, will be an even more challenging ambition within an enlarged Union. These challenges can only be met if we ensure that all relevant players are closely involved in the employment strategy and that they all work together.\nWhat are the main elements of reform? Firstly, stability. Through this reform we have to respond to the short-term challenges of the slowdown in our economies, and face up to the longer-ter", "Conclusions of the European Council meeting (28-29 October) and economic governance (continuation of debate) \nPresident\nWe now continue with the debate on the Conclusions of the European Council meeting (28-29 October) and economic governance.\nKathleen Van Brempt\n(NL) Mr President, listening to today's debate one thing stands out, and that is the big issue - important to almost all the political groups - of economic governance. The consensus is only superficial, as there is a huge difference in interpretation regarding this economic governance. Looking at the Council's interpretation, which can also be seen from its conclusions, one sees a one-sided focus on what the Council considers necessary, namely savings, savings and more savings. It is almost an ideology that has been made into an economic law: one only need save enough and everything will be all right again. That is not our interpretation of economic governance. On the contrary, something completely different will be needed, and our group is not the only one saying this. Look at the economists, look at yesterday's De Tijd - not exactly a socialist propaganda newspaper - which says, and I paraphrase, 'saving on its own undermines already ailing economies and makes it increasingly difficult to repay debts'. Investment is also needed. A very nice, obvious, example of what is needed is an increase in the employment rate. This would enable the repayment of debts, in all our Member States. Yet this requires the courage to invest in education and training, the courage to invest in the balance between work and family life. Looking at the savings in the various Member States, we see that it is precisely this kind of investment that is suffering cutbacks. A vision is needed - a perspective on economic policy - as a basis for mobilising the resources to do this. Only then should we take a look at how best to give shape to the Stability and Growth Pact. I believe that that is the major difference between our perspective", "Welcome\nPresident\nI am now pleased to be able to welcome to the visitors' gallery a high-level delegation from the Turkish Parliament, which has come to Brussels on a three-day study trip. It includes Mr Nihat Erg\u00fcn, Deputy Chairman of the AK Party, Mr Ya\u015far Yaki\u015f, Chairman of the EU Harmonisation Committee, and Mr Sait A\u00e7ba, Chairman of the Planning and Budget Committee.\n(Applause)\nWe wish you a pleasant stay and fruitful discussions with representatives of the European Parliament, Commission and Council.

European Chemicals Agency (REACH) (vote) \n- Before the vote:\nKarl-Heinz Florenz\n(DE) Mr President, with the significance of the following votes and the extent of REACH in mind - for 5 000 amendments to it were tabled over the past five years, and the document currently contains 1 000 of them - I would just like to make two brief points.\nThe first is that I would like to extend very warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Sacconi, and to the shadow rapporteurs, for the work they have done, which was a massive job to tackle, and they did it splendidly, so my heartfelt thanks for that.\n(Applause)\nThat, Mr President, promptly brings me to my second point, which is to ask just what has emerged from the trilogue. We met with the Finnish Presidency of the Council on five occasions; the meetings were not always totally straightforward, and they were once briefly interrupted. What came out of them is before you today in the shape of Amendment 191, which is at the heart of what today's vote is about, and, for the sake of a compromise into which this House has put so much of itself, in a way it never will again, I urge you to vote in favour of it. To our friends in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance I will say that the other amendments will lapse or must not be allowed to jeopardise this important and valuable compromise.\nGuido Sacconi \nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make it clear first of all that I am sitting in this seat not because there has been a 'palace coup' within the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, but for logistical reasons, to make it easier to give voting instructions.\nMr Florenz, the committee chairman, has already mentioned the essential points about the content and the difficulty in reaching the outcome that we achieved in the agreement with the Finnish Presidency. It is now my job to say that this outcome is like a fresco painted by a team of artists: many people have been involved - I recall that ten parliamentary co", "Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries - Scheme of control and enforcement applicable in the area covered by the Convention on future multilateral cooperation in the North-East Atlantic fisheries (debate) \nPresident\n\u03a4he next item is the joint debate on the following:\nthe recommendation by Jaros\u0142aw Leszek Wa\u0142\u0119sa, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council decision concerning the approval, on behalf of the European Union, of the Amendment to the Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries (11076/2010 - C7-0181/2010 - 2010/0042(NLE)) and\nthe report by Carmen Fraga Est\u00e9vez, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down a Scheme of control and enforcement applicable in the area covered by the Convention on future multilateral cooperation in the North-East Atlantic Fisheries - C7-0009/2009 -.\n(The President emphasised that the speakers were required to adhere strictly to their speaking times)\nJaros\u0142aw Leszek Wa\u0142\u0119sa\nThe convention which I have the honour of presenting was signed in Ottawa in 1978 and came into force on 1 January 1979. The Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation, NAFO for short, was created under the convention in order to support the conservation and optimum utilisation of fish stocks and to support international cooperation. The contracting parties adopted amendments to it at NAFO annual meetings in 2007 and 2008. This document introduces fundamental changes to the convention, the principal aim being to bring its wording into line with other conventions at a regional level and with international instruments, and to incorporate modern concepts of fisheries management. The organisational structure has been updated, a clear division of responsibilities between the contracting parties, flag states and port states has been introduced, a more coherent decision-making ", "9. EU and PNR data (vote) \n- Before the vote:\nJean-Pierre Jouyet\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Madam President, Mr Vice-President of the European Commission, group chairmen, ladies and gentlemen, first of all it is not without emotion that I address you at voting time.\nI am delighted that the French Presidency has been given the opportunity to speak to the House on European PNR. This project raises a great many questions, fears and expectations, which all deserve close consideration.\nIt involves a large number of public and private agencies and it is the internal security of the European Union, its notion of fundamental freedoms and rights and even, from certain points of view, its international policy which are at stake.\nThat is why this programme needs a methodical, concerted and progressive approach.\nWe have had open, well-argued debates on specific and concrete questions over the last six months. We have heard from companies in the air travel sector, the services in charge of security in the Member States and the EU Anti-Terrorism Coordinator. We have worked with complete transparency with the data protection authorities and, I must say, the contribution by the European Data Protection Supervisor was extremely helpful.\nThe French Presidency obtained the opinion of the Agency for Fundamental Rights and this initiative was a first.\nIn the same spirit of openness, the Council communicated its wish to associate very closely with this House, regardless of the legal basis or institutional framework actually in force. That is why we proposed to this House that views should be exchanged as frequently as possible on this programme. Your rapporteur also received detailed information informally at each step of the work carried out over the last six months.\nNext week the Presidency will present a written progress report to the Justice and Internal Affairs Council for approval. I promise the House that this summary document will be sent to you.\nThe discussion be", "1. Christian communities in the Middle East (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on seven motions for resolutions on Christian communities in the Middle East.\nMario Mauro\nauthor. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, religious freedom is an objective factor in recognising respect for human rights. The violence suffered by Christians around the world is both an affront and a challenge to human dignity.\nI intended to table this draft resolution at the last plenary in October, but the coordinator of the political groups asked me to postpone the resolution until the November plenary, to give us time to prepare a more detailed text backed by a broader consensus. In the text that we will be voting on this afternoon, which is the result of a compromise between socialists, liberals, the Union for Europe of the Nations Group and the Independence and Democracy Group, the salient features of the initial draft resolution have remained.\nWe have also been able to insert concrete references to acts of violence and abuses committed this year not only in the Middle East, but in other parts of the world against Christian communities. These events mainly concern Iraq, Egypt, Pakistan, Turkey, China and Vietnam, and in fact the intense coordination carried out in the last few days and the consequent unearthing of numerous episodes that have occurred outside the Middle East has led us to find a new, more fitting title, which is 'serious events which compromise Christian communities' existence and those of other religious communities'.\nObviously the text does not include all violence perpetrated against Christians, such as in Eritrea and North Korea. However, ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to recognise the political message of this text, which is also aimed at those countries and incidents that have not been mentioned. From the outset, having to liaise with other groups has allowed me to clarify that this resolution in no way intends to rekindle conflict between", "Situation in Chechnya\nPresident.\nThe next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Chechnya.\nMr de Miguel, the Minister speaking on behalf of the Council, has the floor.\n\nde Miguel\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, since the Russian military operations in the Russian Federal Republic of Chechnya resumed in September 1999, the situation there has been treated as a priority by the European Union. Both the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council, back in December 1999, and the actions of the presidencies which have followed it, are testimony to this. Contrary to what some people predicted, this position has not altered following the attacks of 11 September.\nThe Spanish Presidency has been acting and will continue to act throughout this six-month period in a way that is fully coherent with this issue of concern to the Union. The Presidency's work plan for the development of a common strategy for Russia included a paragraph which indicated our will to 'continue to express the Union's desire for an early peaceful solution in Chechnya within the framework of the principle territorial integrity, the Rule of Law and respect for human rights, to promote an improvement of the conditions for the safer and more effective distribution of humanitarian aid?.\nIn the months since January, these intentions have been turned into various concrete actions. The Presidency has included the Chechen issue on the agenda of all political talks between the European Union and Russia at various levels, with both political representatives, such as the European Union-Russia Ministerial troika, the European Union-Russia political directors' troika and the PSC-Russia troika, and in meetings of experts, the so-called COEST troika.\nOn the occasion of the recent ministerial-level troika with the Russian Foreign Minister, Mr Ivanov, on 2 April, the issue was once again raised by the Presidency. Furthermore, at the beginning of March, the troika of Union Heads of ", "Approval of the Minutes\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nAvgerinos\nMadam President, in yesterday's Minutes I am not registered as having been present. Please could that be corrected, because I was here all day.\n\nPresident\nYou did indeed chair the sitting. I think we can all testify to that. Are there any other comments?\n\nBlokland\nMadam President, I should like to congratulate the House on the completely unfathomable decision it took yesterday evening on the Scarbonchi report to increase the number of jobs by 12 million from 1995 to 1996. I am now curious to see whether the European Parliament decides to put the millennium back a year.\n\nProvan\nMadam President, a photograph was taken in this House yesterday. I do not wish to make an issue of this, but could we have an assurance that the photograph will not be used for any public purpose and, if it is, could the Bureau make certain not only that it does not happen again but also that the Member is punished because he has given an assurance to this House that the photograph was only for personal use.\n\nPresident\nOur colleague told us yesterday that it was a private photograph.\n\nCollins, Kenneth\nMadam President, in the light of that, could we also have an assurance that no private telephone calls made from mobile telephones in this Chamber will be used for any purpose like that either?\n\nPresident\nI have taken note of your suggestions. Mr Kerr wishes to speak on the Minutes.\n\nKerr\nMadam President, you will notice from yesterday's Minutes that I spoke six times on behalf of the Green Group on six different reports.

However, our agenda today is totally overcrowded, so that an important agreement like the cooperation agreement with Macedonia will only be dealt with towards midnight. I would therefore urge that we should organize these meetings better in future. If we had made good use of the last Friday, we could today have dealt with this important subject during the day, in the presence of our guests!\n\nPresident\nYou are right, Mr Posselt. It is a pity more topics were not prepared for the last Strasbourg session, but the committees which were supposed to have completed the relevant reports were not able to approve them in time.\n\nKreissl-D\u00f6rfler\nMr President, I would like to point out that today we have two guests from the Brazilian Federal State of Bahia present. I myself have just taken part in a seminar on Mercosur, and I believe I speak on behalf of us all in calling for a strengthening of our relations with Brazil. I would like to give a warm welcome to Minister Barbosa de Deus and the Vice-Governor of Brazil, Mr Borges. Muchas gracias, muito obrigado!\n\nPresident\nThank you very much. I welcome the guests you mention. However, as you know, the Rules of this House are that the Chair only welcomes visitors who have been officially invited. Many distinguished visitors attend at the invitation of honourable Members, in which case there is not normally a public welcome. However, the Chair is glad to join in your welcome.\n\nFabre-Aubrespy\nMr President, my point relates to page 13 of the Minutes of Friday's meeting in Strasbourg. Paragraph 11 it states that the President reminded everyone", "\nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 22 July 2004. \nPresident.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Ladies and gentlemen, I have the immensely sad duty \u2013 a duty my predecessors have had to carry out on previous occasions \u2013 to open our September session by mentioning the terrorist attacks suffered by the world. Tomorrow, at noon, this Parliament will hold a minute\u2019s silence as a tribute to the child victims of the horror in Beslan.\nIn order to give this symbolic gesture a collective dimension, I have, moreover, asked the 25 Heads of State or Government of the countries of the Union to involve all the schools of Europe in our act of commemoration of these victims. I can inform you that I have already been notified by several governments that they will do so.\nFurthermore, at 9 a.m. tomorrow morning when I speak briefly to introduce our work for this term of office, I wish to analyse the scourge of terrorism from a political standpoint, pointing out the insecurity it causes amongst our fellow citizens and how we should respond to it. We cannot, however, begin our work on 13 September without paying tribute, through the minute\u2019s silence we will hold tomorrow, to all the victims of all the terrorist attacks that have brought bloodshed to many parts of the world, as well as to all the victims of 11 September 2001 in New York and 11 March 2004 in Madrid, to name just the most recent and spectacular cases. In Iraq, in Russia, in the Middle East, in Indonesia and in Afghanistan, many human beings have fallen victim to the insanity of those people who wish to impose their vision of the world through terror.\nI have responded to each of these events on your behalf, ladies and gentlemen, expressing our solidarity with the victims and their families.\nI cannot end without once again calling on the kidnappers of the two NGO workers kidnapped in Iraq, two Italian women who as a result of their humanitarian commitment, working to care for Iraqi children, have fallen vict", "Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting\nPresident\nThe Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.\nAre there any comments?\n\nMacCormick\nMr President, I should like to say that I cast a vote in error yesterday afternoon on the question of referring the bananas issue back to committee. We in this Parliament risk setting ourselves on a course which will fail to help the banana growers and, at the same time, will continue to inflict grave injustice on small enterprises engaged in producing things like bath products and ...\n\n... I therefore wish I had cast my vote the other way. I wish that to be placed on the record.\n\nPresident\nWe will include this in the Minutes, Mr MacCormick.\n(The Minutes were approved)\n\nVan der Laan\nMr President, I only wanted to report my presence for the Minutes. I will not be signing the attendance register as I am leaving in one hour, but I wanted everyone to know that I am here.\n\nPresident\nWe can all see, Mrs Van der Laan, that you are here.\nIt will be included in the Minutes.\n\nVote\nBuitenweg\nMr President, we were somewhat confounded yesterday by an action of a Member of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, but I think that what I am about to announce will not come as a surprise to anyone here, as I explained at length on Monday what I am about to request. In fact, you have also received several e-mails and I have also written to the Conference of Presidents on the matter. The fact is that according to Members of various groups, the agenda on Fridays is too light, as a result of which many Members genuinely believe that their time can be spent more productively elsewhere. Consequently, there are few of us here today and we cannot guarantee that our electorate is adequately represented here. We therefore believe that a choice needs to be made: either we need to give more substance to Friday' s agenda or to abolish the Friday sitting. In this context, I wish to ask for the quorum to be checked.\n\nPre", "Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries\nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the Fourth United Nations conference on the least developed countries.\nZsolt N\u00e9meth\nPresident-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, the European Union is fully committed to the success of the Fourth United Nations conference on the least developed countries, which will take place in Istanbul on 9-13 May 2011. It believes that this conference provides a major opportunity to enhance support for the least developed countries (LDCs).\nThe Council has very recently adopted conclusions to be used as guidelines by the EU negotiators in the preparatory process and during the conference. Prioritising LDCs is a necessity in our common endeavour to reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We therefore remain firmly committed to supporting the inclusive and sustainable development of all LDCs, which represent the poorest and weakest segment of the international community, and which are also characterised by their acute susceptibility to external economic shocks, natural and man-made disasters and communicable diseases.\nWe strongly support an outcome focusing on areas and measures that can add value with regard to the specific needs of LDCs and which should reflect the lessons learned from the 2001 Brussels Programme of Action, by maintaining coherence with the MDGs and setting specific goals and targets for LDCs. A long-term commitment through a renewed partnership with LDCs containing suitable measures is fundamental in a rapidly changing world.\nIn particular, the European Union considers that the outcome of the Istanbul conference should address three main objectives: firstly, combating the vulnerability and fragility of LDCs and further enhancing their resilience to shocks; secondly, creating a favourable environment for the sustainable development of LDCs; thirdly, promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth for", "Together for Health: A Strategic Approach for the EU 2008-2013 (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Alojz Peterle, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the White Paper entitled 'Together for Health: A Strategic Approach for the EU 2008-2013'.\nAlojz Peterle\nrapporteur. - (SL) This report concerns everyone - the sick and the healthy. Health is one of the key social and political issues on which the future of the European Union hangs. The importance of health to the economy is clearly stated in the Lisbon Strategy. Health is one of the most important assets of human life. Due to worrying health trends, especially the rise in cancer cases, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity, and despite the improvements in curative medicine, this asset is under increasing threat. In addition, there are new challenges such as ageing population, climate change, rising food prices and globalisation.\nThere has been talk of pandemics and bioterrorism. On the one hand the World Health Organization has forecast an epidemic rise in cancer cases in future years, and on the other there are ever-stronger demands for patients and medical workers to have freedom of movement. Health systems and their financing are coming under increasing pressure. In recent years the cost of medicines has been rising faster than overall health costs, giving rise to public concern about equality of healthcare and the sustainability of health systems.\nCitizens are worried that there will not be sufficient healthcare for all. They are not interested in debates about competences; they are primarily interested in the best way to be healthy. They are also concerned about equality of healthcare, which is considerable among the Member States, as also within the countries themselves. As far as cancer is concerned, differences in survival rates between the new and old Member States are such that we could justifiably talk of an iron curtain in health. All this ", "Announcement by the President\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, I would like to make the following announcement. In connection with the evacuation drill which took place during voting time, today, all explanations of positions adopted at today's vote will be heard tomorrow - they will be heard together with tomorrow's explanations of vote. Tomorrow, we will also complete the votes which were scheduled for today but were not taken. This concerns the vote which was in progress when voting was suspended, which we will continue from exactly the same point at which it was suspended, so as to maintain complete continuity.\n", "Resumption of the session\nPresident.\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament which was adjourned on 16 April 2002\n\nPresident.\nI should like to take this opportunity to welcome a delegation of Brazilian parliamentarians who have taken their seats in the official gallery. The delegation is led by Mr Foscarini and has been visiting Parliament during the past week. I hope that their visit has proved interesting and informative. You are very welcome.\n(Loud applause)\nIt also gives me great pleasure to welcome among us a group of students from the College Jean Zay in Lens in France, along with their teachers and the Mayor of Lens, Mr Guy Delcourt. They have constructed in their school a unique giant Euro coin which I understand is now in the Guinness Book of Records and on show at the French Finance Ministry. I want to thank them for their efforts and again say how welcome they are in this House today\n\nPresident.\nAs regards today's agenda, I want to inform the House that Mr Cort\u00e9s, Secretary of State for international cooperation in Latin America, cannot be here before 5.30 p.m. The Council and Commission statements on the EU/Latin-American Summit will therefore begin after 5.30 p.m.\n\nSchulz (PSE).\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Party of European Socialists requested that today's agenda include a statement by the Council and the Commission on the common fisheries policy at the beginning of today's sitting. Not only did it request this statement, it also requested a statement by the Commission and the Council on the common fisheries policy and on how the decisions behind the common fisheries policy are taken. We requested this statement because the public is under the impression - an impression which the Spanish Government and its Minister of Agriculture have helped to create - that a Member State's government exerted an influence or pressure on one or more members of the Commission when these decisions were being taken.\nThat alone wou", "Resumption of the session\nPresident\nI declare resumed the session of the European Parliament, adjourned on Thursday 5 July 2001.\nI hope that you have all had an excellent holiday and that you are ready to start work on this session.\n\nTribute\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, I was very saddened to learn of the death of our fellow Member, Jacques Santkin, who passed away on 28 August. As you know, Jacques Santkin had been with us since February 2001 and was part of the Group of the Party of European Socialists. He was a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and was also a member of the delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council.\nI would like to ask you to observe a minute' s silence in memory of our fellow Member.\n(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)\n\nStatement by the President\nPresident\nLadies and gentlemen, it is once again my sad duty to open this part-session with a further condemnation of the mindless and brutal terrorist attacks which occurred in Spain during the summer.\nOn behalf of the House, I would like to express our unwavering solidarity and our deepest sympathy to the families of the victims and I do so with a great deal of emotion and sadness.\nThe European Parliament today pays tribute to Justo Oreja Pedraza, a Spanish army general, Luis Ort\u00edz de la Rosa, member of the Spanish national police, Mikel Uribe, member of the regional Basque police, and Jos\u00e9 Javier M\u00fagica Astibia, town councillor in Leiza for the Union of the People of Navarre, whose family is present today. I would like to say to his wife, children and his sister-in-law that we admire the courage you have shown in the face of this tragedy, which has taken a loved one from you.\nJos\u00e9 Javier M\u00fagica Astibia always stood up for freedom and democracy and he refused to bow down to terror. Unfortunately, this cost him his life. Terrorism intends to continue its reign of terror by placing bombs in airports, on ra", "Explanations of vote\nPedro Guerreiro \nThe purpose of this Commission proposal is to incorporate into the Community acquis conservation and enforcement measures adopted by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO), to which the Community is a signatory. In keeping with the simplification of other legislation, the Commission has taken the opportunity to update and bring together in a single legislative document all of the rules spread across several regulations. The rapporteur has updated these rules with other texts adopted following the Commission's proposal, as part of the regulation on total allowable catches and quotas for 2007.\nThe simplification proposal is, in itself, a good thing. We feel, though, that the consequences of some of the measures incorporated for the long distance fleet, for the fisheries sector and by extension for national economies should be pre-empted and managed.\nI wish to point out that Portugal was one of the founding Members of NAFO, represented by the Community when it joined in 1986. This has not brought us any great benefits - quite the opposite in fact, as evidenced by the difficulties facing the Portuguese long-distance fleet.\nBairbre de Br\u00fan and Mary Lou McDonald \nin writing. We have problems with the SIS and particularly the planned SIS II, which will create enormous databases with too few guarantees to protect the privacy of citizens.\nHowever, this report does not change the nature of the current system, just extends it to new Member States. Without access to SIS, the citizens of these countries will not be allowed to travel freely in the rest of the EU.\nFor these reasons we voted in favour of the report.\nMiroslav Mikol\u00e1\u0161ik \nThe legislative resolution of the European Parliament on which we have voted today, which Parliament has already adopted and which I also backed, is a major milestone in the enlargement of the Schengen area.\nThis resolution will contribute to the speedy implementation of the acquis communautaire as ", "2. Conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity (\n- Before the vote on Article 2e:\nAlejo Vidal-Quadras\nrapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, I wish to add the following to Article 2e.

Code of Conduct for computerised reservation systems (\n- Before the vote:\nJeanine Hennis-Plasschaert\non behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I speak on behalf of the ALDE Group, with regard to the Kirkhope report. Pursuant to Rule 168, the ALDE Group would like to make a request for referral back to committee. To be clear, there is no intention of breaking up the compromise package with the Council as such, but my group does believe that a more extensive debate on the definition of a parent carrier should take place.\nThe Commission is working on a formal notice, which is most welcome. However, that does not give us the 100% clarity we need at this very moment. A proper debate should be allowed for, as well as decent consultation of our legal services. There is no rush to put this matter to the vote at this very moment.\nBrian Simpson\nMr President, I am happy to speak in favour of the ALDE Group motion to refer this back to committee. In my long years in this Parliament I cannot recall, within the transport area, a report that has caused so much confusion and uncertainty as this one. We are making law here, and with that comes a responsibility to act with full knowledge and understanding of the text that honourable Members will be asked to vote on. Yet many Members are unsure. Many Members are struggling to comprehend and understand this complex piece of legislation, made even more complex by the intervention of the Council.\nThere is great uncertainty, great unease across a wide spectrum of this Chamber, which is why I believe we need to reassess, re-evaluate and examine more carefully the implications of these proposals back in the Committee on Transport. It is about getting it right, not about doing it quickly. By doing this, we will not be creating problems; we will be acting responsibly as legislators, defending Parliament's right to work at its pace, not at a pace dictated to it by industry lobbyists and the Council of Ministers.\nGeorg Jarzembowski\n(DE) M", "1. Draft general budget of the European Union - 2009 budget (vote)\n- Before the vote\nJutta Haug\nrapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, the explanation process is the same as it is every year. Before the vote I need to inform Parliament about some technical adjustments. I know that this is not very interesting for my fellow Members, but we need to record it in the Minutes.\nFirstly, as already indicated in the voting list, the vote on amendment 783 to budget line 22 02 04 02 only concerns payment appropriations.\nSecondly, the explanations concerning the global energy assessment do not belong on budget line 08 03 01, where they have mistakenly been included, but on line 08 05 01. Therefore the vote on amendment 936 to line 08 03 01 must be made without the comments on the global energy assessment. These will be included instead in amendment 938 to line 08 05 01.\nI know how enthusiastic everyone is about this.\nThirdly, the reinstatement of resources in the Preliminary Draft Budget for the decentralised agencies with their titles in lines 1 and 2 also includes, of course, the reinstatement of their establishment plans. This applies to the European Medicines Agency, the European Chemicals Agency, the European Aviation Safety Agency, the European Maritime Safety Agency, the European Railway Agency, the European Environment Agency, the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training, the European Food Safety Authority, the Community Fisheries Control Agency and the Community Plant Variety Office, whose establishment plans are not specifically included in the documents accompanying the amendments.\nFourthly, as the result of a comment from the Legal Services an explanation included on several budget lines must be slightly modified. This concerns the sentence which begins 'The Commission may' up to 'and to transfer to the internal auditor of the Commission' in the following amendments: Amendment 994 to line 19 04 01, amendment 1011 to line 21 02 01, amendment 1015 to line", "Election of the President of the European Parliament\nPresident\nThis morning, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, we must elect the President. According to Rule 13 of the Rules of Procedure, candidates for the office of President of our Parliament must be nominated, with the consent of the people concerned, by a group or by at least 40 Members.\nUnder the conditions provided for in the Rules of Procedure, I have received the following nominations for the office of President of the European Parliament:\nMr Jerzy Buzek\nMrs Eva-Britt Svensson\nThe candidates have informed me that they consent to their nomination as candidates. Both candidates will now introduce themselves briefly, starting with Mrs Svensson.\nEva-Britt Svensson\n(SV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate all my fellow Members on the trust that has been shown in you by the citizens of your respective Member States. This is an enormous amount of trust and hence it is also an enormous responsibility for us all to meet our citizens' expectations and demands for the changes that are needed and to build a citizens' Europe. Democracy, the right to choose their elected representatives, is the most important instrument that our citizens have. To be able to talk of true democracy requires more than the right to vote. It requires openness, transparency and an open debate.\nI would therefore like to say that it is extremely important for us now to ensure that we reform the first reading procedure. We must take the trust shown in Parliament seriously and demonstrate the openness that is also required with regard to the first reading procedure.\nLadies and gentlemen, we are facing huge challenges: an economic crisis with higher unemployment, increased exclusion and social insecurity. We have a climate crisis that has already resulted in climate refugees. As usual, it is the poorest people that are hit first and hardest. We see an EU and a world full of injustice and poverty. There are, howe", "Situation in China after the earthquake and before the Olympic Games (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in China after the earthquake and before the Olympic Games.\nJean-Pierre Jouyet\nPresident-in-Office. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, China is a strategic partner of the European Union. Our political and trade relations are particularly strong; I would point out that the European Union is China's largest trading partner.\nChina's involvement at international level, like the resolution of major regional and global issues, is of great importance to the European Union. The Union also has the aim of encouraging development and reforms in China for the benefit not only of the country itself but also, given its size, of the entire planet, and it is in this context that we have followed with grave concern the consequences of the earthquake that hit Sichuan Province in May and assessed the scale of this disaster; with more than 70 000 dead and 18 000 missing, the final toll, unfortunately, is likely to exceed 80 000. In addition, more than 5 million people have lost their homes. For several weeks, the earthquake and its great human and material losses have led China to mobilise its entire state apparatus, and the international community has recognised the efforts made by China to respond quickly and effectively to the disaster.\nThe European Union responded swiftly by providing humanitarian aid; the Community Civil Protection Mechanism was immediately activated on 13 May to coordinate in-kind contributions from Member States; aid totalling EUR 25 million provided by the European Union, including the Member States - EUR 2.2 million of which were contributed by the Commission - has been channelled through the Red Cross.\nBroadly speaking, we feel that China has played an effective role during relief operations and that, with the assistance of the international community, it is making considerable e", "Halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010 (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Adamos Adamou, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010.\nAdamos Adamou \nMadam President, the report on which we are to vote is about halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010. This is a subject, the topical nature and importance of which is something on which the majority of us agree. That is also the reason why such a small number of amendments was tabled by my honourable friends, together with the fact that the report was passed unanimously by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.\nI should like to congratulate the Commission on its communication, on its conceptual approach, its priority objectives for 2007-2008 and its key supporting measures. Nonetheless, I must at this point express my profound concern at the continuing loss of biodiversity and the related decline of ecosystem services.\nI believe that we all recognise the urgent need for an effort to meet commitments to halt the loss of biodiversity in the European Union by 2010.\nThe action plan is a vital tool and is our last opportunity to bring together actors at Community and Member State levels on key actions to meet the 2010 commitments. I recognise, however, that the action plan will be insufficient to conserve biodiversity and sustain ecosystem services in the longer term.\nTo continue, I must stress that it is exceptionally important for the Natura 2000 network to be completed on land and at sea and for effective management and adequate financing of the network. I must also stress the importance of timely and effective implementation of the Water Framework Directive to attain good ecological status of freshwaters.\nI urge the Member States to ensure that projects funded by Cohesion and Structural Funds do not harm biodiversity and ecosystem services but optimise benefits to biodiversity.\nPassing on to another ", "Agreement between the EC and Mauritius on the short-stay visa waiver - Agreement between the EC and Seychelles on the short-stay visa waiver - Agreement between the EC and Barbados on the short-stay visa waiver - Agreement between the EC and Saint Kitts and Nevis on the short-stay visa waiver - Agreement between the EC and Antigua and Barbuda on the short-stay visa waiver - Agreement between the EC and The Bahamas on the short-stay visa waiver (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the joint debate on:\nthe report by Mr Busuttil, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Mauritius on the short-stay visa waiver - C7-0015/2009 -,\nthe report by Mr Busuttil, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Seychelles on the short-stay visa waiver - C7-0012/2009 -,\nthe report by Mr Busuttil, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and Barbados on the short-stay visa waiver - C7-0017/2009 -,\nthe report by Mr Busuttil, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis on the short-stay visa waiver - C7-0013/2009 -,\nthe report by Mr Busuttil, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and Antigua and Barbuda on the short-stay visa waiver - C7-0016/2009 -,\nthe report by Mr Busuttil, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and H", "Explanations of vote\nOral explanations of vote\nFrank Vanhecke\n(NL) Mr President, the vote on the Corbett / M\u00e9ndez de Vigo report that has just been held is a further confirmation by this Parliament of the attitude we have been taking for a very long time now: that of total disdain for the democratically expressed will of the majority in France, the Netherlands and elsewhere. Although this Parliament claims to represent all European citizens, in reality those citizens do not have the slightest say. When the President of this House, Mr P\u00f6ttering, said just now that, with this vote, Parliament was expressing the opinion of the majority of European citizens, it was nothing short of a pathetic lie. Parliament has made not a single demand for the will of the people to be respected, nor a plea for a referendum to be held in every Member State. On the contrary, the only thing this Parliament has required is that this duplicate of the late Constitution enter into force as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, this Parliament represents not citizens, but simply the elite consensus of the official Europe.\nSyed Kamall\nMr President, I voted against the report because, once again, the political elite of the European Union is trying to ram through the Constitutional Treaty without consulting the peoples of Europe. The British Government promised a referendum on this Treaty, yet now it is pretending that it is somehow different. You only have to listen to leader after leader, such as Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing, to realise that there is actually no difference.\nI say to you, the European political elite, that if you think you are building a European project but are building a European project without the will of the people, then you are in fact building a castle made of sand. As the late, great Jimi Hendrix once said, castles made of sand fall into the sea eventually. The ratification of the European Constitution, despite its rejection in two referendums, is undemocratic, cowardly and il", "Political parties at European level and rules regarding their funding (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the report by Mrs Giannakou on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the application of Regulation (EC) No 2004/2003 on the regulations governing political parties at European level and the rules regarding their funding (A7-0062-2011).\nMarietta Giannakou\nMr President, Parliament is being called upon today to debate the report which I drafted on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the regulations governing political parties at European level and the rules regarding their funding by the European Parliament. Despite the fact that there is a similar regulation, European political parties have not enjoyed a statute in keeping with the Lisbon Treaty and the European Union in the past, by which I mean a statute as defined in Article 10(4) of the Treaty of Lisbon, which talks of political parties at European level helping to form European political awareness and express the will of the citizens of the Union. Obviously, this does not mean that European parties will operate as international non-governmental organisations at the level of the Belgian State. That is why, having accepted the Secretary-General's report on party funding and his proposal to create a statute and the European Parliament's proposal in the previous 2003 report on the need for such a statute - except that the Treaty of Lisbon had not yet been adopted then - and, finally, the Bureau's decision of 10 January, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, following a serious hearing with all the political parties, chairmen and secretaries at European level and distinguished professors of economic and constitutional law and following a hearing of Transparency International and the EU Court of Auditors, approved this report, which calls on the European Commission to table a corresponding proposal, so that we can have a real European statute for political parties.\nOf course, th", "15.

In the interests of saving time I will not refer to private communications. Nevertheless, how is it that there are four Commissioners and four different views?\nWhat message, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, can I pass on to Greek farmers who have converted or wish to convert their crops to produce first-generation biofuels following the restructuring of the CMO in sugar?\nIoan Mircea Pa\u015fcu\n(RO) For the near festival organized by the European Parliament as part of the intercultural dialogue, each country was requested to produce a film on this theme. From what I understand, Romania's initial proposal was not accepted for the reason of not answering to the theme, but the production replacing it, namely the film California Dreaming, has even bigger shortcomings.\nThe first one is that it answers even less to the theme, despite its opening night at Cannes, mystifying the reality and altering my country's image. While all the other films transpose the intercultural dialogue at a personal, human level, the film California Dreaming relates an imaginary case of an American transport through Romania, which is stopped by the local authorities and ends in a civil war.\nMoreover, the film is pigmented with obscene language, and scenes of explicit sex and violence, a unique case in the festival. I don't believe all these are virtues of the intercultural dialogue. But the biggest shortcoming is that, apparently, this film was not selected by the Romanian party, but by the European Parliament public servants.\nIf this is true, the situation is serious, because an apolitical concept, such as the intercultural dial", "Commission Legislative and Work Programme for 2010 (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the statement by Mr Barroso, the President of the European Commission, on the Legislative and Work Programme of the Commission for 2010.\nI would like to stress that a good number of Commissioners are also present in the Chamber. The whole European Commission is strongly represented, because the subject is extremely important for all of us. We have had to curtail the subject somewhat, because of the change to the order of business, and after listening to what Mr Barroso has to say, we will hear speeches from the chairs of the political groups, who will give a political opinion on what the Commission is proposing for 2010. Then we will ask Mr Barroso to speak again and to respond to the comments of the chairs of the political groups.\nPresident\nPresident Barroso, thank you for coming. It has not been easy for any of us to get to Strasbourg. Many Members have not arrived at the European Parliament, so the attendance is not very high. We decided not to vote during this part-session because everybody must have the opportunity to vote, and some Members could not come to Strasbourg at all. So there are some quite new rules for this part-session.\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the honour and the pleasure of presenting to you today the first work programme of this Commission. It is also the first work programme since the Treaty of Lisbon came into effect. I have the honour and the pleasure of presenting it alongside practically my entire team, the European Commission, as a sign of respect for your Parliament.\nThis programme is being presented at a decisive moment for Europe, since it is now that we must act. This programme is the direct outcome of our political dialogue. After intensive consultations based on the political guidelines that I presented for the next five years, this Parliament entrusted me, in September, with the responsibility of a second mand", "Smoke-free environments (debate) \nPresident\nThe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council on smoke-free environments by Edite Estrela, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, - B7-0225/2009).\nEdite Estrela\nFirstly, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs of all the political groups for their joint work and the effort they have made in order to be able to table a joint resolution in such a short time. I would also like to thank the secretariat of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the secretariat of my group and my assistant for their support. They have all been outstanding.\nOn behalf of the Committee on the Environment, I will begin by expressing my regret that the Swedish Presidency has decided to finalise this dossier without waiting for Parliament's report. This attitude shows an unacceptable disregard for those elected by Europe's citizens. Hence the question that I put to it on behalf of the Committee on the Environment: can the Council confirm its intention to adopt conclusions on this subject in the Council of 1 December 2009, despite Parliament's timetable? What are the reasons for the Council to rush into adopting the recommendation without the European Parliament's opinion? Since Parliament was consulted on the Commission's proposal, is the Council prepared to take Parliament's view into account when drafting the Council's conclusions?\nIt should be noted that the Committee on the Environment supports the objectives of the recommendation, since tobacco is still the leading cause of death and disease in the European Union. The Committee on the Environment would therefore like its timetable to have been respected, which would allow for a thorough debate to be held on the issue and for Parliament to adopt a position.\nExposure to environmental tobacco smoke, also known as passive smoke, is a significant additional cause of death, disease and disability in the European Uni"]
